 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particulate material which is exposed to moisture typically                     has the surface of each particle coated with a thin film of                     water.  It is often necessary to remove this water before the                   material can be used.  The water may contain dissolved                          substances which are important to recover.  Drying and                          recovery are tedious and expensive operations.  A new                           technique shows that surfactants spreading at the air-water                     interface in such \"unsaturated\" porous media drag a                             significant amount of water with them.  This water movement                     occurs with essentially no external energy input.  The                          criteria for surfactant effectiveness in moving thin water                      films are different from bulk systems, and are not understood.                                                                                                  The objectives of this research are to understand and optimize                  water transport by surfactant spreading.  Definitive                            experiments will be conducted using classical surface                           chemistry techniques available in the laboratory.  The work                     will shed new light on the character of water at interfaces,                    and on thin film properties in general.  It has direct                          applications to room temperature drying or de-watering                          stabilization of building foundations without mechanical                        tamping of the earth, and underground mining and environmental                  cleanup without expensive excavation.",
