 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides support for participation of                two University of Miami scientists, in an on-going research                     project in Karachi, Pakistan, at the Pakistan Council of                        Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) under the direction of               Dr. M. A. Beg.  The project aims at finding optimum methods to                  remove pollutants from industrial waste water so that it can be                 reused.  The research has been underway for three years, and at                 the stage of moving from laboratory studies to pilot plant                      treatment.  The work deals with small tanneries as well as                      textile mill waste waters.  For small tanneries the treatment                   covers high pH, high solids, biological aeration, and for textile               mills it is based on ultrafiltration.  It is anticipated that the               existing pilot plant will be modified, and additional, more                     representative, types of tannery and textile wastes will be                     collected from various plants.                                                                                                                                  Scope:  This project brings two U.S. specialists and well known                 researchers in environmental sciences with an active senior                     Pakistani scientist to collaborate in finding viable solutions to               one of the most common and damaging problems in urban areas of                  developing countries.  The results can have wide application in                 many countries where both the scarcity of water and the                         pervasiveness of contamination from low-tech industries cause                   severe degradation of the quality of life.  The project fits well               within the guidelines of the Science in Developing Countries                    Program.",
