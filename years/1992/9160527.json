 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common dilemma in ecosystem modeling is the complexity of                     biological systems and the lack of sufficient data.  Traditional                modeling approaches require quantitative data and detailed                      knowledge of the ecological system.  Although such data may be                  available for small controlled systems such as the laboratory                   microcosm, in most cases sufficient information is not available                for large natural systems.  Qualitative modeling is a recent                    modeling approach developed to alleviate this problems.                         Qualitative models encapsulate more complex submodels by                        replacing continuous quantitative variables with descriptive                    state variables and equations with \"if...then\" transition rules.                This approach follows the recent development in hierarchical                    ecosystems theory and provides a compromise position between                    complex models and insufficient data.  The use of qualitative                   models in ecology has been limited up to now and the software                   tools for the researcher has been constrained to programs                       implemented for specific case studies.  In this study the                       investigators propose to develop a general qualitative modeling                 program applicable to wide range of ecological problems.  The                   program will be based on an intuitive graphical interface                       conferring the benefits of easy access for users without                        specialized programming knowledge.",
