 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis os the process whereby plants convert solar                 energy into chemical energy. This process supports all life on this             planet. A detailed knowledge of how photosynthesis occurs in leaves             is necessary for understanding  solar energy conversion in land                 plants. The project \"Leaf Structural Properties that Influence                  Photosynthesis: Interactions Between gradients of light, CO2, and               Photosynthetic Capacity\" will examine how leaf anatomy is related               to the photosynthetic performance of the whole leaf. The overall                goal is to examine the mechanisms that lead to optimization of                  photosynthetic performance in different types of plants. Species                have been selected that have specific leaf anatomical features and              we plan to make correlations between leaf anatomy, penetration of               light into the leaf, and internal gradients in carbon dioxide                   concentration. Internal concentrations of both light and CO2 must               be optimized for maximum photosynthetic performance of the whole                leaf. Experimental results should allow us to establish a baseline              for a more mechanistic understanding of why some plants are more                productive than others.                                                                                                                                              Microscopy, CO2 exchange measurements and a new fiber optic                microprobe technique will be used to accomplish the objectives of               this project. The resulting information may be applied to problems              that relate to understanding the physiological basis for plant                  productivity and increasing crop yield, and how plants may respond              to global climate change resulting from increases in atmospheric                concentrations of greenhouse gases.",
