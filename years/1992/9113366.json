 "awd_abstract_narration": "Endocytic cargo traverses endosomal vacuoles before encountering             acid hydrolases in lysosomes.  Both endosomes and lysosomes have an             acidic interior believed created by vacuolar proton pumps resident              on their membranes.  Lower Ph in these endocytic compartments is                crucial for lysosomal hydrolases, and the sorting of ligands,                   receptors, and membrane components.  Where these membranes derive               their pumps is unclear.  Data from studies on Dictyostelium                     discoideum indicate that endosomes and lysosomes have undetectable              proton pumps on their membranes.  In addition, abundant proton                  pumps are present on a discrete and easily separable vacuole,                   termed \"acidosome.\"  The data suggest that through transient                    association, in the presence of cytosol and magnesium ions, the                 acidosomes provide protons but not proton pumps to the endosomes.               The proposed transport of protons and counterions but not large                 molecules from the proton-pumping ATPase rich acidosomes to the                 endocytic vacuoles might proceed through small channels spanning                their apposed membranes, perhaps akin to synaptophysin pores in                 presynaptic ends or gap junctions.  Experiments are proposed to                 elaborate and test the hypothesis that proton transfer is the                   mechanism of endosomal acidification.  The acidosomes, endosomes,               and cytosol factor(s) will be purified.  The reconstitution of                  proton transfer between organelles in vitro using the purified                  preparations of acidosomes, endosomes, and the required cytosol                 factor(s) should provide sound evidence for this hypothesis.  In                addition, dynamic communication between these organelles and the                required factor(s) will be probed under differing modes of                      endocytosis.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Endocytosis, the uptake of materials from the cellular environment              by invagination of the plasma membrane and pinching off to form a               membrane-enclosed intracellular organelle containing the material               in question, is a crucial process in the life of a eukaryotic cell.             It is key to transport and assimilation of nutrients, signal                    transduction, and biological defense mechanisms.  This study will               enhance our understanding of the fundamental process of                         endocytosis.",
