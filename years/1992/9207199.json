 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bdelloid rotifers are common fresh-water invertebrates comprising               4 families, numerous genera and hundreds of species.  Neither males             nor meiosis are known within the Class.  Although remarkable, this              does not exclude rare or unrecognized forms of genetic exchange.                A more rigorous test is therefor required.  The proposed                        investigation depends on the expectation that a diploid line that               lost sexual reproduction and genetic recombination far back in its              evolution will accumulate a much higher level of silent-site                    heterozygosity than a sexually reproducing line.  For a given gene,             heterozygosity will be measured by comparing the nucleotide                     sequences of its two homologues cloned from the DNA of a rotifer                population grown from a single egg.  Such tests will be done with               a number of different genes and different bdelloid families and                 genera.  Bdelloid DNA will also be examined for mobile genetic                  elements, in order to test the possible association between sexual              reproduction and the load of insertion mutations.  For comparison,              heterozygosity and mobile elements will also be investigated in                 monogononts, a class of rotifers in which sexual reproduction and               meiosis are known.                                                              %%%                                                                             The usual and accepted view is that without sex and recombination,              evolution and adaptive success is not possible.  That hypothesis,               however, has been impossible to test.  The availability of Bdelloid             rotifers and recombinant DNA technology have changed that and this              work may make it possible to find a more definitive answer to a                 fundamental question in genetics.",
