 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation have helped to                clarify phylogenetic relationships in many plant groups.  However,              the most common types of cpDNA data cannot be applied to parasitic              plant lineages that are completely non-photosynthetic.  I propose               to use a new source of data, sequences of nonphotosynthetic                     chloroplast genes, to investigate phylogenetic relationships in a               family containing photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic forms.                   Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae are ideal for these studies                  because they contain plants with a wide range of parasitic                      behaviors, including some that are highly destructive to important              crop plants.  Additionally, plants in this group display                        remarkable variation in cpDNA structure and gene content associated             with the loss of photosynthesis.                                                     A multiple approach involving gene sequencing and cpDNA                    mapping will examine the molecular phylogeny of this group and                  fully describe its variation in cpDNA structure and gene content.               The study will focus on critical \"transition\" genera that unify the             Scrophulariaceae with the (nonphotosynthetic) Orobanchaceae, but                will include species in both groups plus outgroup taxa.                              Significant developments that should derive from this research             include: (1) Efficient molecular systematic approaches that can be              used within plant families, even \"troublesome\" ones that include                nonphotosynthetic plants.  (2) Opportunities to learn much about                the phylogenetic relationships and character evolution within the               most economically important group of parasitic plants. (3) A much               deeper understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of cpDNA                    molecular variation.",
