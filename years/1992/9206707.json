 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like other proteins that regulate gene expression, homeodomain                  proteins appear to be modular in nature. Regulatory target                      specificity is determined by the homeodomain and immediately                    adjacent regions while other less characterized protein domains                 are required for regulating gene expression. The specific aim of                this proposal is to understand how protein domains outside of the               homeodomain contribute to regulatory activity. The Drosophila                   homeotic gene Abdominal-B provides an excellent experimental                    system for the study of regulatory domains. Abdominal-B encodes                 two proteins that differ only by a glutamine rich domain, but                   have different genetically defined functions during development.                Using a heat shock promoter system to ectopically express                       proteins during embryogenesis, preliminary results demonstrate                  that distinct segmental transformations are generated by each                   Abdominal-B protein, as well as a chimeric protein consisting of                the Deformed protein but with a substituted Abdominal-B                         homeodomain. To analyze the contribution of regulatory domains to               the diversity of phenotypes observed, putative regulatory domains               will be altered through in vitro mutagenesis. The modified                      constructs will be ectopically expressed, and their effect on                   cuticular transformations and expression of target genes will be                compared to the regulatory activity of the normal Abdominal-B                   proteins.",
