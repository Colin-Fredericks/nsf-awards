 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining how detailed risk analysis models should be is an                   important question in analyzing the risks of complex technological              systems such as nuclear power plants, liquid natural gas storage                facilities, hazardous material transport, and the space shuttle.                Both overly detailed and overly simplistic models can lead to                   erroneous risk estimates.  However, this issue has gone virtually               unstudied despite the widespread growth of risk analysis in the                 last 15 years.                                                                                                                                                  Past work by one of the investigators on this project has                       identified three potential sources of error in risk analyses:                   modeling error; parameter error; and aggregation error.  Different              types of errors are minimized by simple versus detailed models.  In             particular, in the case of aggregation error, the use of overly                 simple models can neglect information that may be available at more             detailed levels.  For example, at the time of the Challenger                    disaster, an aggregate analysis based only on 0 accidents in 23                 flights would have indicated increasing reliability with each                   flight.  However, a disaggregate analysis including the evidence of             O-ring erosion on 6 of the 23 flights would have concluded that a               substantial level of risk remained.                                                                                                                             The principal investigators for this project have identified                    necessary and sufficient conditions for aggregation error to vanish             in simple risk analysis models.  However, these conditions are                  unlikely to be achieved in practice.  Therefore, there is a need to             understand the determinants of aggregation error when perfect                   aggregation is not achieved.  The proposed work will provide                    guidance on the circumstances under which aggregation error will be             severe, so that large errors can be avoided through the use of more             detailed models in such cases.",
