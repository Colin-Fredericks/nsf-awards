Electronic packaging is considered to                               be a critical area where a significant increase in                              research and research training output is needed to                              maintain the strength of the U.S. in the 1900's                                 and beyond.  The proposed facility will be an                                   integral part of the Industry-Cornell University                                Alliance for Electronic Packaging, a unique                                     alliance between Cornell University and a diverse                               set of companies including IBM, Digital Equipment,                              Carbonundum, and AMP.   Its mission is to perform                               both basic and pre-competitive direct research to                               achieve world-wide leadership in electronic                                     packaging.  Electronic packaging research at                                    Cornell is also supported by the Semiconductor                                  Research Corporation which is a consortium of U.S.                              companies organized to sponsor research in the                                  universities to enhance the competitiveness of the                              U.S.  The research activities supported by the                                  Alliance and the SRC are currently growing in five                              key areas: architecture and design, interconnects,                              materials and thin films, optoelectronics, and                                  thermal management.",
