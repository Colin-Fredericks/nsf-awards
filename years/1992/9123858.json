 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of the proposed research is to develop                  physical and genetics systems for the delivery of cloned DNA to any             insect species with subsequent site specific integration into the               genome.  We will explore the ability of Drosophila melanogaster                 embryos whose vitelline membranes have been permeabilized by a                  recently developed procedure to take up both DNA and nucleotide                 precursors.  We will also utilize Drosophila embryos which are                  mutant for two predominant deoxyribonucleases to increase the                   persistence of the introduced DNA in both the somatic and germ                  cells.  The third aim of the research is to adapt the \"Flip                     recombinase\" system from yeast for use in insect hosts.  Initially              Drosophila and Musca domestica (housefly) embryos will be                       transformed with the recombination site sequence (FRT).  Then, the              recombinase gene will be introduced along with selectable marker                genes in plasmids containing a single FRT sequence.  Site specific              recombination of the marker genes will be monitored by genomic                  Southern and chromosomal in situ hybridization analysis.  Because               such a more efficient and site directed transformation system that              is developed for Drosophila as a model system should be applicable              to any other insect species, it will be possible to introduce genes             at will into insect pests and vectors of human disease.  This                   ability should allow biologists to devise new strategies for insect             control.***//",
