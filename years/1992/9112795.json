 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thiamin diphosphate (TDP, the vitamin B1 coenzyme) is one of                    the most important coenzymes in carbohydrate metabolism                         catalyzing e.g. the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to                    acetylCoA in the reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate                             dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, enabling the product of                      glycolysis to enter the citric acid cycle.  High resolution                     structural of such TDP-dependent pyruvate decarboxylating                       enzymes are being conducted by a variety of techniques.  The                    principal target has been brewers'yeast pyruvate decarboxylase                  (PDC, E.C. 4 1.1.1) recently purified as fully active alpha4                    and beta4 homotetramers in addition to the alpha2beta2                          heteroteramer reporter earlier.  In a most important and                        exciting recent development the alpha 4 structure was                           crystallized in the laboratory already providing novel                          information, and pointing to the likely success of resolution                   to at least 2.4 A. PDC is the most widely studied TDP-dependent                 eznyme and is therefore the best one on which to undertake the                  detailed structural studies proposed below.  In addition to the                 x-ray developments major progress has been made in the                          spectroscopic characterization of enzyme-bound intermediates.                   It is proposed to extend these studies along the following                      lines of inquiry: 1.  structural work on PDC by x-ray                           crystallographic methods (this part of the research is a                        collaborative effort with SAX, Fuery and coworkers at the VA                    Hospital Biocrystallography Lab/Univ. of Pittsburgh)n to                        determine: a. the structure of the \"TDP fold\", identify the                     putative beta-turn-alpha-turn-beta structure at the TDP binding                 site; b. the basis of interaction between the TDP and Mg2+ with                 PDC; c./ the conformation of bound TDP, and of putative                         covalent intermediates; d. the nature of protein-protein                        interactions in PDC, i.e. among subunits in the absence and                     presence of the allosteric regulator pyruvamide; 2. mechanistic                 work of PDC, especially to elucidate the nonoxidative and                       oxidative chemistry of the enzyme-bound enamine; 3.                             immunochemical structural studies on PDC to determine                           immunochemical differences, if any, among isoforms; and on                      pyruvate dehydrogenase to probe its structure with the                          monoclones already at hand; 4. structural work on PDC and its                   TDP fold by NMR methods to determine the microenvironmental                     factors in catalysis.  A collaboration has been initiated with                  S. Hohmann, who has cloned PDC in a variety of forms, and has                   and will supply the yeast containing the site-directed mutants,                 as well as the clones to address both structural and                            mechanistic questions.",
