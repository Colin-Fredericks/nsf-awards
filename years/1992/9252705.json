 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida State University seeks funds to develop a program for                   the mathematics preparation of preservice middle grades                         teachers.  The purposes of the project are: to plan and                         implement courses in mathematics learning and teaching and                      mathematics for prospective middle school mathematics teachers                  based on problem-centered learning; to construct a model of                     prospective teachers' cognitive operations in learning; and to                  develop tasks and protocols for investigating knowledge                         structures, beliefs, values, and classroom practices of                         prospective middle school mathematics teachers.  Five                           mathematics courses and two mathematics education courses will                  be revised or designed as a sequence of experiences which                       provide opportunities for prospective middle school                             mathematics teachers to reflect on mathematical knowledge,                      beliefs, and practices.  Using a teaching experiment design,                    the proposers will construct explanations and models of                         participants' understanding and beliefs about mathematics and                   mathematics teaching and learning.    Faculty from the                          Mathematics Department and the College of Education will                        collaborate to develop the programs.  There is an in-service                    component which include area teachers.  The dissemination plan                  includes work with other institutions in Florida and faculty                    members from the state and the nation.                                                                                                                          Cost sharing is approximately 10% of the NSF funds.",
