The Environment, Science and Technology Counselors/Attaches are                 key parts of Embassy country teams.  They work in support of USG                interests as the focal points in Embassies on topics including                  environmental, space, health, energy, nuclear non-proliferation,                economic competitiveness, oceans, population and other issues.                  They advise Ambassadors and report and make representations on                  these issues.  These officers also conduct and manage bilateral                 science and technology agreements.  OES has held such conferences               not only in updating the Embassy representatives on current                     developments, but in providing Washington officers an opportunity               to debrief them directly.  The conferences have also enlisted                   much attention and participation from the Congress and technical                agencies.  The conference presents an important opportunity both                for NSF staff to consult directly with many of the officers with                whom they deal and for the Science Officers to improve their                    understanding of NSF concerns and priorities.",
