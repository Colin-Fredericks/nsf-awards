 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports cooperative research between T.D.                  Dickey of the University of Southern California and Isabelle                    Taupier-LeTage of the Center for Oceanography in Marseille,                     France.  The investigators will study biological responses                      associated with the mesoscale hydrodynamical features in the                    western Mediterranean Sea.  The objectives of their research are to             develop two types of moored, interdisciplinary instrumentation,                 which will be utilized in studies of western Mediterranean                      mesoscale features, and to initiate joint field measurements.  Dr.              Dickey and his research group bring to the collaboration innovative             approaches to moored instrumentation development and its                        application to multidisciplinary questions in oceanography.  They               have considerable expertise in the collection, analysis and modeling            of bio-optical and physical data sets.  This is complemented by the             French group's experience with physical and biological                          measurements and theory relevant to the western Mediterranean                   Sea.                                                                                                                                                            Recent advances in interdisciplinary oceanic measurement systems                now make it possible to collect physical and bio-optical data                   concurrently.  Problems concerning the physical and biological                  processes, the carbon cycle, and global climate change  require                 simultaneous and complementary moored measurements, ground                      truth and remote sensing observations.  The further development of              sensitive and accurate moored instrumentation will advance                      capabilities to collect information about these processes.",
