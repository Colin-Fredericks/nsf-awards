 "awd_abstract_narration": "The timing and development of leaf canopies represent an                   essential part of the adaptive strategy of deciduous trees and                  herbs.  This canopy phenology is an extremely sensitive indicator               of the many factors such as climate, soil moisture, and land use                that affect natural vegetation.  At coarse spatial scales, the                  phenology of natural vegetation is strongly correlated with                     climate.  In order to understand how phenology may be used as an                indicator of climate change it is necessary to establish first                  the baseline variation in phytophenological rhythms under current               types of environmental variation.  Multitemporal observations of                phenology made from satellite platforms provide a unique way of                 assessing ecosystem dynamics at a variety of spatial and temporal               scales and thus provide a crucial link between local-scale                      studies and global data sets.  This study will use multitemporal                satellite, climate, and ground reference data to document and                   model regional canopy phenology in several different extensive,                 but contrasting, plant communities in south-central Africa.  The                project will use field data and satellite imagery to reveal                     contrasts in regional-scale phenology and to validate the                       satellite measurements.                                                              Increased climatic variation under enhanced greenhouse                     conditions is expected to produce severe disruptions in the                     annual life cycles of many organisms.  The relationship of                      current phenological rhythms to the climate at the present time                 may provide clues as to the probable effects of future climate                  change on regional vegetation types.  In order to understand how                phenology may be used as an indicator of global change, this                    study will establish baseline variation in phytophenological                    rhythms under current levels of climate variation.",
