 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introductory biology students, especially those with poor                       academic preparation, are often simultaneously overwhelmed and                  bored by the amount of information they are expected to                         assimilate.  Students' confusion and discontent stem in part                    from their inability to perceive the structure underlying the                   discipline and in part from their lack of engagement with the                   subject matter.  To address these problem a two-semester                        introductory sequence for biology majors is being developed,                    which has a strong thematic base and a highly visible                           scaffolding to assist students in constructing their own                        knowledge frameworks.  A major objective is to lay the                          foundation for continued education in biology.  In each                         laboratory unit being developed a single theme, such as Energy                  Input, Uses of Energy, or Information processing, is                            investigated at different levels of organization (molecular,                    cell, structural, organismal, ecological) and with different                    types of organisms.  Each unit includes activities of varying                   complexity, structure, and leeway for student inquiry.                          Students choose from among the available activities and design                  their own experiments, and work cooperatively in small groups.",
