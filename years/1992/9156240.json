 "awd_abstract_narration": "ComputingThis project encourages more students, especially                      minorities, women, and the physically disabled, to enter                        careers in computer science and engineering.  The target                        audience consists of students enrolled in introductory classes                  for non-science majors, future teachers, as well as                             introductory courses for computer science and engineering                       majors.  The project illustrates the major themes of computer                   science and engineering; fosters technological literacy; and                    provides hands-on familiarization, exploratory learning and                     experimentation with computer applications using an integrated                  academic program of interactive, instructional software and                     digital video delivery options.  Two modules, Computers and                     Television, and Computers and Music, are being designed,                        developed, prototyped, and evaluated.  Provisions are being                     incorporated into the products so that they may be ported to                    various software platforms.  The goal of the products is to                     allow students to not only master the most important principles                 of computer science and engineering, but also discover that                     science is exciting, engaging, and interesting and open to                      minorities, women, and the physically disabled.",
