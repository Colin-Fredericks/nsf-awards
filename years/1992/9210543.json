 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lythraceae is a plant family best known for the popular                     cultivated crape myrtles, the pomegranate, and the purple                       loosestrifes.  They are serious invaders of North American                      wetlands.  Other important genera are Henna, from which henna dye               is obtained; heimia, an hallucenogenic plant used by the Aztecs;                and cuphea, a promising new industrial crop being developed for its             specialized seed oils.  The family is primarily tropical and,                   although its evolutionary history is unclear, it is considered one              of the oldest members of the large order Myrtales.  The natural                 relationships of the 31 genera are not easily determined, but                   computerized phylogenetic analysis of the floral, wood, and                     vegetative characters have produced hypotheses suggesting where the             family originated, what major divergent lines have evolved, and how             the modern genera are related.  The hypotheses are not strongly                 supported by morphological characters, probably because of                      substantial loss of intervening taxa through time.  Taxonomic                   classification of the family is also inadequate and needs to be                 revised based on phylogenetic information.  Molecular data offer                powerful new sets of characters for estimating phylogeny of the                 family.  The research proposed will obtain DNA sequence data from               the nuclear and chloroplast genomes in 28 genera, construct                     phylogenies based on actual evolutionary changes at the molecular               level, and combine molecular and morphological information to                   produce a better understanding of the history and biodiversity of               this important plant family.  The Molecular Systematics Lab at the              Smithsonian Institution is an ideal facility for the molecular                  studies.  Modern characterization of the family will contribute to              active basic botanical research aimed at establishing the overall               history of the flowering plants, and to a myriad of applied                     research problems, including protection of wildfowl habitats from               invasion by loosestrife, production of specialized seed oils for                industrial and medicinal use, and investigation of lythraceous                  alkaloids for new drugs.",
