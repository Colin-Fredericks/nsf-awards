 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research investigates the relationship of vascular                 plant species in abandoned agricultural wetlands to factors of the              physical/chemical environment by analyzing their respective spatial             patterns.  Large areas of forested peatlands have been cleared for              agriculture in the Lake States and in New York.  These wetland                  ecosystems undergo extreme alterations upon drainage, clearing, and             cultivation, until eventually abandoned.  Currently, state and                  federal regulatory agencies and the muckfarming industry debate                 whether abandoned mucklands are irreversibly altered or revert to               naturally functioning systems.  Although much information exists                on old-field and forest succession, no studies have investigated                successional patterns in abandoned agricultural wetlands.  In 1991,             investigations of abandoned mucklands in Oswego County were                     initiated.  Examination of photographic records and preliminary                 field surveys have revealed large variation in species response to              mucklands abandoned for different lengths of time.  Measured or                 observed variability in surface water depth soil solution pH, marl              sublayer features, calcium ion concentration, and soil profile                  characteristics further indicates nonhomogeneity.  Recognition of               spatial heterogeneity of plant distributions is fundamental to                  understanding processes of succession.  Patterns and trends will                be identified and quantified by using a combination of                          geostatistical and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques.",
