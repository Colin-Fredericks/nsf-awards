 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Louisiana will enhance the research                    competitiveness of approximately 54 scientists working in 5                     research clusters at four institutions (University of                           Southwestern Louisiana, Tulane University, Louisiana State                      University, and Tulane University Medical Center).  The                         research areas to be studied are:  (1) Development of a                         Interdisciplinary Center in Molecular Evolution; (2)                            Mechanism of Action of Lytic Peptides; (3) Synthesis of                         Properties of Enzymes and Other Biopolymers; (4) Fault                          Tolerant Neural Networks: Design Theories and Applications;                     and (5) Transport Processes Through Interfaces, Membranes,                      and Porous Media.  NSF funding through the state's EPSCoR                       Committee (\"LaSER\") has provided a catalyst to structure and                    target the earnings from the Louisiana Educational Quality                      Fund (LEQSF), a $550 million trust fund dedicated to                            enhancing education.  Since 1987, $56 million has been                          expended from LEQSF in carefully targeted science and                           engineering (S&E) fields to increase research                                   competitiveness, enhance departments, endow chairs, and                         provide graduate traineeships.  EPSCoR activities are                           designed to increase the average federal expenditure level                      per S&E in five priority fields by 30 to 45 percentage                          points against the national average, and to increase the                        number of S&E bachelors and doctoral degrees awarded,                           particularly among minorities, to approximately 90 percent                      of the national per capita average.  These objectives will                      be achieved by continuing successful LEQSF/LaSER programs                       and building on the strengths developed in, or emerging                         from, the projects being supported through stimulation the                      formation of strong focused research groups and using such                      \"clusters\" to promote S&E human resource development.  The                      State and institutions will contribute over $12 million over                    3 years.",
