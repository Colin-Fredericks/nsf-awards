 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America seeks funding for a                     one year project which is aimed at investigating the state of                   teacher preparation with regard to minority populations.  The                   project has three major facets:                                                 i.  A study which will be conducted with data collected                         throughout the nation to inform the mathematics community                       about minorities going into the teaching of mathematics at                      the secondary level.                                                            ii.   A working conference which will bring a small group of                    experts together to address different components of the                         problems and to present papers which feature model programs                     for minority preservice education.  Papers will be revised                      after the conference, and submitted to MAA committees and to                    members of a select panel.                                                      iii.  This Blue Ribbon panel of distinguished educators and                     leaders in various related areas will hold a conference,                        together with all other project participants, and will react                    to the papers and the results of the study.                                     The end-product of the MAA effort will be a document which                      includes the study and the papers produced by the project                       participants.  The document will be disseminated to the MAA                     membership.                                                                                                                                                     MAA cost sharing of approximately 3% of the requested amount                    is shown by their reduction of the indirect cost rate from                      34% to 30%.                                                                     The funds awarded to this project is the revised amount,                        $91,362.",
