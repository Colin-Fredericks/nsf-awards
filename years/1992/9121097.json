 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that functions as a chemical                      messenger in the brain.  It has been shown to be involved in                    regulating a number of behaviors, including aggression,                         reproduction, communication and learning and memory.  Dr. Ferris                has focused his efforts on the relationship between vasopressin                 and communicative behaviors.  He has identified the                             neuroanatomical sites where vasopressin acts to mediate the                     behavior.  Thus, Dr. Ferris has developed a excellent model for                 studying the neural circuitry of a defined behavior.  Recognizing               that this neuropeptide system goes through progressive changes                  during development, Dr. Ferris will now correlate the ontogeny of               vasopressin cell bodies and vasopressin receptors with the                      ontogeny of the communicative and aggressive behaviors.  In                     addition, he will examine the interaction between                               glucocorticoids, a family of steroid hormones secreted by the                   adrenal under stressful conditions, and the vasopressin system in               the brain.  These studies will determine whether stress during                  early life can have permanent effects on the brain which can                    alter behavior in adulthood.",
