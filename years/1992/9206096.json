 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a molecular genetic analysis of a newly discovered                   tumor-suppressor gene (warts,abb.wts) in Drosophila.  The gene is               identified by the tumorous phenotype of mitotic-recombination                   clones that are homozygous for small chromosome deficiencies of the             wts gene.  Absence of the wts gene from imaginal disc cells causes              excess cell proliferation, causes clone rounding presumably by                  interfering with control of oriented cell divisions, and allows                 cuticle to be secreted between cells as well as over their apical               surfaces.  The wts gene is known, from cytogenetic mapping, to be               present in DNA that has already been cloned.  We will isolate new               mutations in wts and other unidentified tumor suppressor genes                  using a new method for revealing the homozygous phenotype of                    recessive mutations in mitotic recombination clones.  We will                   identify the transcription unit corresponding to wts in the cloned              DNA by mapping deficiency breakpoints and wts mutations at the DNA              level.  We will isolate cDNAs corresponding to wts and determine                their nucleotide sequence in order to predict the amino acid                    sequence and possible function of the gene product.  Antibodies                 will be raised against a fusion gene product made in bacteria, and              the antibodies will be used to localize the gene product at both                light and electron microscopic levels.  We will mark wts clones in              the undifferentiated imaginal disc in order to further examine the              effects of the mutation on clone growth and on the distribution of              cytoskeletal and cell-surface proteins.                                         %%%                                                                             The identification and characterization of novel tumor-suppressor               genes in this simple model system of the fruit fly may lead to the              identification of new tumor-suppressor genes in man.",
