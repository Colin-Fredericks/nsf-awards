 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides partial support for the conference on                    \"Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM)\", to be held in Tucson, Arizona           April 29- May 1, 1992.  Combinatorial Pattern Matching addresses                issues of searching and matching of strings and more complicated                patterns such as trees, regular expressions, extended expressions,              etc.  The goal is to derive nontrivial combinatorial properties for             such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to                achieve superior performances for the corresponding computational               problems.  This area is expected to grow even further due to the                increasing demand for speed and efficiency that comes especially from           molecular biology and the Genome project, but also from other diverse           areas such as information retrieval (e.g., supporting complicated               search queries), pattern recognition (e.g., using strings to                    represent polygons and string matching to identify them), compilers             (e.g., using tree matching), data compression, and program analysis             (e.g., program integration efforts).Two quite successful CPM Meetings           have been held already.  CPM 90 was held in Paris and CPM 91 in                 London.",
