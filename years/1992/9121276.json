Previous research                 on ruminative thinking has not fully addressed such questions as:               Where do such thoughts come from in the first place?  What                      motivates people to think at all?  Why do they think about one                  thing as opposed to another?  Finally, why do people ever stop                  thinking about something?  These researchers have developed a                   theory that addresses three basic questions about rumination:                   What starts it?  What stops it?  And what determines its content?               The theory suggests that the blockage of personal goals leads to                thought.  The content of thought is determined by several factors               including individuals' beliefs about what is important in the                   situation and what they have learned to associate with that                     situation.  A series of theory guided experiments and field study               will explore: the role of goals in initiating and terminating                   rumination; the role of people's own subjective theories about                  their goals in determining the content of rumination; the role of               goal non-attainment in producing analytical, problem solving                    thinking as opposed to feeling centered thinking; the relative                  effectiveness of blocked goals versus the environment                           ininitiating very long-term (i.e., years) rumination.  This                     research should yield a better understanding of the factors                     involved in activating spontaneous thoughts, determining their                  content, and reducing their power to intrude.",
