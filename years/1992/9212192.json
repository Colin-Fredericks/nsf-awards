Foliar uptake by plants represents                                     an important sink for many air pollutants yet                                   factors                                                                         for characterizing pollutant uptake are used                                    in regional atmospheric models are currently                                    applied with a large degree of uncertainty.                                     For improving these deposition estimates,                                       laboratory experiments are needed in which                                      gas exchange rates are accurately measured                                      and results interpreted to improve the                                          transport models and validate their                                             predictive capability.  The proposal leading                                    to this award was submitted in response to                                      NSF 88-99 as modified by changes dated                                          09/19/91 to make the Research Initiation                                        Award announcement consistent with changes in                                   NSF 83-57 and published as NSF 90-77.                                                                                                                           Results of this research are expected to                                        enhance our understanding of the transport                                      and fate of trace gases in plant leaves and                                     lead to more effective parameterization of                                      deposition and emission rates for vegetation,                                   for use in regional air quality models.                                         These, in turn can be utilized in improving                                     engineering design of processes and systems                                     for abatement and control of air pollution.",
