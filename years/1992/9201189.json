 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the application of novel \"in -source\" mass               spectrometric (MS) techniques for the molecular-level                           characterization of (sub)-microgram quantities of particulate                   organic matter (POM).  The overall objective is to relate changes               in POM composition to water column-based biogeochemical processes               and to assess the importance of these processes in determining the              chemical characteristics of sedimentary organic matter.  Observed               variations in POM composition will be interpreted in the context of             current concepts for organic matter preservation.  This objective               will be pursued by investigating the composition of organic matter              in samples of phytoplankton populations, particulate matter and                 surface sediments from high productivity (Peru Upwelling region)                and oligotrophic (Sargasso Sea) Oceanic environments.                                                                                                           The analytical approach adopted seeks to overcome several                       limitations which currently prevent the application of molecular                markers as routine tools in marine geochemistry.  Specifically, in-             source MS offers advantages as a rapid, high sensitivity method                 which can be used to study compositional features of complex                    mixtures over a wide range of molecular sizes and polarities.  The              major focus is placed upon structural aspects of macromolecular                 constituents of POM, however, an assessment of lipid composition                will also be made in an attempt to provide a more holistic                      perspective of POM transformation.  The inherent sensitivity of in-             source MS will be exploited by studying compositional variations in             sub-factions of POM separated by flow cytometry.  In this way,                  chemical variations can be related to well-defined particle                     characteristics (size, shape, chlorophyll content), enabling                    systematic relationships to be established between the composition              of phytoplankton and POM.",
