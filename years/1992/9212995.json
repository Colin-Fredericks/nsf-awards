 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the effects of plant species diversity on               the cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in a restored California                 serpentine grassland.  Native forbs and grasses from four                       functional groups that differ in phenology, C/N ratio, rooting                  depth, root-to-shoot ratio, and other characteristics relevant to               nutrient cycling will be used.  Plots will be planted with                      different compositions and diversities of these functional groups               to test five hypotheses: 1) Differences in plant phenology and                  associated functional characteristics result in different patterns              of nutrient turnover and retention in plots composed of separate                functional groups; 2) Increasing diversity causes an increased                  importance of plant uptake relative to microbial immobilization;                alternatively, it results in decreased nutrient loss from the                   system; 3) Increases in functional group diversity result in                    decreased seasonal variability in nutrient availability; 4)                     Maximum rates of nutrient turnover do not increase with increasing              diversity; and 5) Below-ground litter turnover and diversity in                 below-ground plant functional characteristics have greater effects              on nutrient dynamics than does above-ground litter.",
