For a                          three-year period beginning in 1992, each of eleven                             undergraduate students will do \"hands-on\" research under the                    direction of a faculty member who will be matched with the                      student.  Students will be immersed in an intensive 10-week                     summer program which has been carefully planned to provide a                    positive working environment and to enhance: (1) the students'                  interest and fascination in chemistry and biochemistry; (2) the                 students' technical skills in the laboratory; (3) their ability                 to design and interpret experiments; and (4) their ability to                   communicate verbally and in writing.  The research experiences                  will extend beyond the summer and continue throughout the                       academic year, with a second full-time laboratory period during                 the semester intersession.",
