 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ciscoes of the Laurentian Great Lakes once represented the                 most diversified incipient species flock of Coregonus in North                  America.  Though the taxonomy of the coregonine fishes has always               been difficult to resolve, the extensive extirpations and                       extinctions of ciscoes which have occurred throughout the Great                 Lakes system within the last few decades have hampered efforts to               classify remaining stocks of fish and to understand the                         evolutionary process involved in their speciation.  The proposed                study would involve restriction fragment length polymorphism                    (RFLP) analysis of nuclear DNA and restriction site mapping                     analysis of mitochondrial DNA, later followed by polymerase chain               reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of rapidly-evolving                 nuclear and mitochondrial genes from fresh and museum specimens                 of Laurentian, Artic, and Eurasian ciscoes.  Cladograms                         constructed from DNA-level homologies will be compared to those                 derived from morphological data to deduce genetic relationships                 among these fishes.  Results of this research may lead to a                     better understanding of the evolution of the Coregoninae, reveal                underlying genetic principles behind the evolution of fish                      species flocks, and enable genetically sound management of                      remaining stocks of ciscoes in the Great Lakes.",
