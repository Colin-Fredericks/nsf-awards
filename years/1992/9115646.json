The project will study how fishermen from                a rural Swedish village coordinate their work activities given a                set of constraints from their social life, cultural tradition,                  human cognition and the physical environment.  Working from                     videotapes of activity in fishing boat settings, transcripts will               be produced that make explicit the representations used by actors               to satisfy task constraints with the resources at hand.  The                    transcription process involves a translation of behavioral data                 into a language that reveals the task-relevant representations                  that are communicated, acted upon, or otherwise used to enable                  coordination.  The data will test propositions about the                        relationships between cognitive action, cultural resources, and                 social processes.                                                                                                                                               This research is important because understanding how task groups                solve problems and coordinate action can help society design                    equipment and processes to minimize error and improve efficiency.               The relevance to important work activities, such as air traffic                 controllers, and navigation teams, is clear.",
