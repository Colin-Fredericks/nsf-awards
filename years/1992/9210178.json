 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern engineering systems often utilize closed-loop control in                 order to meet requirements on system performance. Condition                     monitoring systems augmenting the control system are seen to be a               means of enhancing reliability, reducing operating cost and                     extending system lifetime. This research is a general system-                   theoretic approach which will promote the integrated analysis and               design of condition monitoring and control systems. This approach               is based on recent results from algebraic systems theory allowing               the integrated condition monitoring and controls problem to be                  imbedded in a general control systems architecture. The                         capabilities of this approach will be demonstrated as follows:                  First, this approach will be used to illuminate the extent to                   which condition monitoring and control system design objectives                 impact one another. Second, existing control system design tools                will be extended to handle the design of integrated condition                   monitoring and control systems. Third, these tools will be used                 to obtain analytical results quantifying the design trade-offs                  involved. Fourth, these tools will be used to address open                      research questions related to generating condition monitoring                   system specifications and selecting condition monitoring sensor                 suites. Finally, it will be shown that the above results can be                 extended to classes of nonlinear plants.*** //",
