This Consortium involves 30 faculty members spread                     over 27 major degree-granting physics institutions.  The main                   goal of the Consortium is to improve the teaching of physics by                 making more effective use of the power of modern personal                       computers.  The Consortium is developing physics simulation                     software and accompanying texts which complement material                       normally covered in nine upper-level undergraduate physics                      courses.  A typical simulation may perform calculations of real                 physical systems, based on a model, or analysis of real data                    from experiments.  The texts describe numerous exercises and                    experiments that students can perform with each of the                          simulations.  The purchased equipment consists of computers of                  sufficient power to run the CUPS software and specialized                       projection apparatus needed to demonstrate the CUPS software.                   Demonstrations are necessary to acquaint students with the                      software.  The remaining computers are being used by students                   to carry out projects and exercises based on the CUPS software.                 The CUPS software must be thoroughly tested at each of the                      participating institutions before general release.  The                         equipment is essential for the success of this endeavor.",
