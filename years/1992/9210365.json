 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent proliferation of digital binary output devices, such as              laser printers and facsimile machines, has brought increased                    attention to high quality halftone reproduction. A question that                often arises in halftone research is how to evaluate the quality                of halftone images using a quantitative quality metric. Such                    metrics would allow objective evaluation, in addition to being                  independently reproducible. Halftoning introduces unique types of               distortions, and to be able to formulate quantitative quality                   measures for halftones it is first needed to develop visual models              that agree with the response of the human visual system to halftone             images.  However, the problem of developing such models has                     received scant attention. For the above reasons, the first                      objective of the proposed research is to investigate how different              visual models can predict the quality of halftone images, and then              based on these models, formulate quantitative quality metrics.                                                                                                  Visual modeling can also be used for the improvement of existing                halftone processes, and provide a basis for the development of                  visual-model-based halftoning algorithms. In the proposed research,             visual modeling will be incorporated in the construction of a                   halftone mask which was developed by the investigator in her Ph.D.              thesis. The incorporation of visual modeling will improve the                   performance of the halftone mask and permit the development of a                halftoning algorithm that combines utilization of information about             the human visual system and speed, since the mask is completely                 independent of the image to be halftoned and needs to be                        constructed only once.",
