 "awd_abstract_narration": "Material processing and intelligent manufacturing will be                  studied in an interdisciplinary format involving process modeling,              in-situ product quality monitoring, and real-time process control.              The program will initially focus on molded and advanced composite               products.  Two fundamental manufacturing science problems will be               addressed, which are (1) the majority of manufacturing processes                are not completely understood, and (2) product quality is not                   monitored and optimally adjusted during fabrication.  Improved                  process models for molding and advanced composites will then be                 employed in real-time environments to direct manufacturing                      processes toward optimal product quality in a feedback control                  manner.  Doing so will require the development of sensor subsystems             for in-situ product quality assessment and knowledge based tools                for real-time manufacturing precess adaption.  Methodologies for                operations will be developed.  Several sensory transducer                       mechanisms will be investigated, with an initial focus on embedded              optical and electronic fibers.  Real-time process adaptation will               be accomplished through the development of knowledge based tools                incorporating neural networks.                                                       A novel component of the effort will be the procurement of                 neural network training information from process simulation models              rather than from actual manufacturing data.  Overall, the                       synergistic manufacturing methodology development will decrease                 both process development time and cost while improving product                  quality and process flexibility.",
