 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most interesting questions being addressed in                  higher eukaryotic organisms concern the regulation of gene                      expression at particular stages of development that involve                     communication between subcellular organelles.  The model system                 that has been developed in cytoplasmic male sterile common bean                 provides ideal genetic materials to address these questions.  The               system has a number of unique features.  Two distinct nuclear-mito-             chondrial genetic interactions have been identified that result in              an altered pollen phenotype.  Evidence suggests that at least some              aspects of this interorganellar interaction are developmentally                 regulated.  The focus of this study is a mitochondrial sequence,                designated pvs, associated with abnormal pollen development.  The               project includes development of antibodies against the putative                 products of two open reading frames within pvs.  These antibodies               will characterize the expression of the two predicted mitochondrial             products in response to the presence of nuclear gene Fr.  Fr                    results in the elimination of the pvs sequence together with the                surrounding mitochondrial region.  A second nuclear gene, Fr2, is               predicted to alter expression of pvs.  Both Fr and Fr2 restore                  normal pollen development.  The experiments will include Western                blot analysis, immunoprecipitations, and in situ backcross and F2               populations, the cytoplasmic male sterile line, a number of                     spontaneous cytoplasmic fertile revertants, and a normal control                line.  The proposed research will also include characterization of              transcription of the mitochondrial pvs region.                                       The experiments will characterize the developmental expression             of a mitochondrial sequence in response to two distinct nuclear                 genes that alter pollen development.  The experiments will also                 identify potential regulatory sites within this mitochondrial                   sequence.",
