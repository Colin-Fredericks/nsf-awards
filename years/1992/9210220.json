 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing award.                The process of updating a view in a relational database usually                 requires the translation of an update into updates over the                     underlying base relations. This process can be complex since the                translation may not be unique.  A generalization of the view                    update problem in relational databases is equivalent to the                     update of an intensional relation in a deductive database in                    which only the extensional database can be modified. The aim of                 this research is to design and implement update algorithms for                  stratified normal deductive databases by incorporating                          disjunctions in the extensional part of the database.  The                      algorithms consider single insertions, single deletions  and                    transactions.  A fundamental structure for the implementation  of               the algorithms are interpretation trees that are used to compute                answers to queries in disjunctive deductive databases. The                      research also addresses the issue of integrity constraints in                   disjunctive databases. So far, constraint satisfaction in                       disjunctive databases has been relatively unexplored;                           nevertheless, it has been shown that there exists a strong                      connection between disjunctive databases with constraints and the               stable model semantics for normal logic programs.  Hence, the                   development of algorithms to check integrity constraints will                   indicate directions to define procedures to answer queries in                   normal logic programs under the stable model semantics.",
