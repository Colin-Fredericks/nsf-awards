 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cereal tribe is a group of grasses that includes three of the               most important genera of crop plants:  Triticum (wheat), Hordeum                (barley), and Secale (rye).  Each of these genera has been                      extensively studied.  The tribe also includes 34 other genera, some             of which are major forage grasses and many of which have genetic                characteristics that would be desirable to introduce into the                   cereal grasses (e.g. salt tolerance, drought tolerance).  These                 non-crop genera are much less well-known.  The transfer of genes                through plant breeding is most successful when it involves closely              related plants.  Therefore, it would be useful to have rigorous                 models of how wheat, barley, and rye are phylogenetically related               to each other and to other members of the tribe.  There is a                    substantial data set available on floral and leaf structure for the             cereal tribe, but these data are phylogenetically ambiguous, and                there are insufficient characteristics to measure relatedness with              confidence.  This study will go beyond the floral and leaf data to              explore variation with the DNA of these plants.  Preliminary data               suggest that the chloroplast DNA sequences, or samples of those                 sequences, can be compared for the members of the tribe and will                provide an estimate of which species are most closely related to                the major crops.  Also, because DNA can be extracted from even very             young plants, it will provide an early way to identify plants that              could only otherwise be identified at flowering.  Both the                      estimates of relatedness and the DNA markers will provide important             tools for plant breeders.  An added benefit will be information on              the structure of plant DNA in general and how it varies in                      different plant groups.",
