 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is an investigation of the potential biological                 processes which may maintain differences in the sizes of flowers                among populations of an annual wildflower native to California.                 The species under study, Nemophila menziesii, exhibits extensive                variation in flower size among populations, and shows a striking                pattern in which those populations native to the interior                       mountain ranges surrounding California's central valley are the                 largest flowered; populations on the cost are intermediate, and                 those from southern California produce flowers.  Essentially,                   this study seeks to determine why this pattern exists.  The study               is evaluating whether 1) deterministic, or 2) random biological                 processes (or both) are important in maintaining these population               differences in flower size, and 3) whether or not the variation                 in flower size among populations is adaptive.                                        Using a large data set collected from  herbarium specimens,                this study directly tests for geographic patterns in flower size                that would be expected to be generated by natural selection, and                patterns that would be expected if random processes were more                   important in generating the population differences in flower                    size.  To augment the study of natural selection using herbarium                specimens, reproductive fitness of plants which differ in flower                size are being monitored to determine whether or not natural                    selection for flower size currently occurs.  This possibility of                differences in flower size being due to inbreeding is being                     tested by determining the level of inbreeding (using                            electrophoresis) in two populations which differ in the average                 size of their flowers, and also by experimentally determining the               effects of inbreeding by comparing plants from outcrossed and                   inbred matings in these same two populations.",
