 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polarized noble gas samples of 3He, 21Ne and 129Xe provide                 tools for our multifaceted program investigating fundamental                    interactions at the atomic, nuclear and nucleon scale.  We                      have advanced from the exploratory stage of four years ago,                     when large quantities of 3He were first polarized by spin                       exchange with laser optically pumped Rb, to the successful                      development of high precession NMR frequency spectroscopy and                   the realization of polarized 3He targets.  With the techniques                  developed, we are able to measure free precession frequencies                   with a precision of 10-7 Hz in a one hour measurement interval                  and have set new limits on Lorentz Invariance violation due to                  Mass Anisotropy with respect to a preferred direction.  A                       measurement of the time reversal invariance violating electric                  dipole moment (EDM) of Xe129 is underway.  This measurement                     should be sensitive to the EDM at a level of 10-27 e-cm.  Our                   study of the optical pumping and spin exchange mechanisms,                      theory and measurement of depolarization including ionization                   by the accelerator beam, the development of diode laser arrays                  and exploration of new light sources have made possible the                     practical application of polarized 3He as a target for neutron                  polarization and accelerator experiments.  We are now in the                    process of building an experiment at the MIT Bates LINAC to                     measure the electric form factor of the neutron by quasi-                       elastic scattering of polarized electrons from polarized 3He.                   We will also demonstrate the feasibility of a scaled up target                  for a measurement of the neutron's spin dependent structure                     function by deep inelastic scattering of polarized electrons                    from polarized 3He at SLAC with the intent of undertaking that                  measurement as soon as possible.",
