 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to initiate a program of                             paleontological and geological exploration in the Manonga Valley                of northern Tanzania in order to ascertain the potential of the                 fossil sites in the area for the study of human evolution.  A                   preliminary reconnaissance by the principal investigator in 1990                demonstrated that the Manonga Valley which has been almost                      completely unexplored previously, is an area of tremendous                      potential for future paleoanthropological research.  The ancient                lake basin, with its extensive, well-exposed and fossil-rich                    sediments can now be considered one of the most significant                     paleontological research areas in eastern Africa.                                                                                                               Only a few isolated and fragmentary fossil remains of early human               ancestors are known from Africa prior to 4 million years ago.                   The estimated age of the sites in the Manonga Valley (3-6 million               years old), in conjunction with their paleontological                           productivity, and their close geographical proximity to other                   important sites that have yielded fossils pertinent to human                    evolution, makes the region of evident significance for the study               of human origins.  The major objectives of the project are: (1)                 to make paleontological collections at the principal fossil                     localities and to continue to prospect for new sites; (2) to                    further assess the geological context and the age of the fossil                 sites; and (3) to obtain data that will help to reconstruct the                 paleoenvironmental setting of the ancient lake basin.",
