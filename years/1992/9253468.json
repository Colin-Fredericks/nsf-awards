This project                      consists of two main components:  a 2,800 sq. ft. exhibit                       and related education program.  The exhibit will communicate                    ecological principles and provide visitors of all ages with                     an appreciation of the diversity and beauty of freshwater                       wetlands habitats.  The exhibit is comprised of three main                      areas:  an introductory theater, an immersion diorama, and                      an interactive hall.  Exhibits are designed to present many                     aspects of freshwater wetland habitats, including hydrology,                    dendrochronology, organism structure, and function, life-                       cycle, ecological research, and environmental policy.                           Through interactive exhibits on scientific concepts,                            visitors will gain an appreciation of both a particular                         habitat and the process of science and its application to                       their lives.  The major objectives of the education program                     are to help teachers of grades 4-8 to bring the study of                        freshwater wetlands into their classrooms and to employ                         experientially oriented pedagogy.  The project will offer a                     teacher resource guide, prepared in collaboration with state                    science curriculum staff, a satellite workshop for teachers,                    a freshwater wetlands edition of Wildlife in North Carolina,                    a statewide publication prepared in collaboration with the                      NC Wildlife Resources Commission, and a classroom program in                    the museum.",
