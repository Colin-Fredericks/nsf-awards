 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthetic reaction centers in plants are the key to                        photosynthesis and hence life on Earth.  The specific projects                  involve a variety of measurements on the quinone constituents of                the reaction center.  These include a) in vitro analyses, b)                    binding free energies of systematically varied quinonoid probe                  molecules and c) binding free energies of quinones in binding                   site structure varied through selected mutation.  These data                    will, aided by computational methods, be used to construct a                    binding free energy map of the QA sites of the reaction center of               Rb. sphaeroides and Rp. viridis.  Building on this knowledge, we                will test novel electron transfer events by making use of                       tethered diquinone molecules in which one quinone is in the QA or               the QB site and the other occupies positions down the binding                   domain normally occupied by the native isoprene chain.                          %%%                                                                             This work is also important for the following reasons:  Quinone                 binding sites in proteins of respiration and photosynthesis are                 the targets of many herbicides and antibiotics.  Quinones                       represent the structural foundation of a large class of chemical                that includes certain vitamins, hormones, redox cofactors and                   drugs.  Knowing how they bind and function in this system is                    yielding information that is of general application to the design               of such molecules of value to the agricultural and medical                      fields.  The opportunities they offer in addressing outstanding                 questions regarding how electrons transfer through proteins has                 similar importance.  Control of how these common chemicals                      interact with natural tissue and what controls their redox                      activity again has impact on understanding the mechanisms of                    biological energetics, the side reactions of many drugs, and also               forms the basis of developing guidelines for the design and                     ultimate synthesis of redox proteins.",
