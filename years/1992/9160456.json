 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal aims to determine the feasibility of a                        sophisticated system for retrieving statistical data about risk                 and prognosis, as a means of aiding decisions for physicians                    whose practice include breast-cancer patients.  The proposed                    research will use survey methodology---including surveys of                     physicians and medical schools---to determine practicing                        physician's statistical environment, including their training,                  their perceived need for and attitudes about statistical data,                  and their use of computers and computerized databases.  A set of                statistical training modules will also be used to assess                        physicians' statistical experience.  The data analysis will                     characterize the responding population and will identify                        potential barriers to physicians' use of computerized data                      retrieval and decision systems.  These data will be used to                     develop guidelines for the user interface of such systems, with                 particular emphasis on compensating for the identified barriers.                An on-line 'help' system, providing reviews of basic concepts and               targeting likely errors of interpretation (for which the                        statistical modules will be a prototype) is viewed as a                         potentially important component of the interface.",
