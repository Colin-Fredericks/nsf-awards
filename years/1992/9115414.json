 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research to merge, reorganize, and                     expand several disparate planktonic foraminiferal abundance data                sets (and their associated environmental data) that have been                   derived from core-top sediment and sediment trap samples from                   around the world.  The long-term goals of the PIs are several                   fold:  (1) to produce a global, taxonomically consistent set of                 foraminiferal assemblage samples (both the modern sediment and                  sediment-trap derived) that represent the full range of                         environmental and preservation conditions in the modern ocean:                  (2) to produce a data base of foraminiferal abundances,                         preservation states, and expand the related hydrographic data for               both sediments and sediment traps; (3) to use the data base to                  evaluate existing and develop new methods of paleoenvironmental                 estimation; (4) to test the sensitivity for sediment-based                      environmental estimates to post-depositional alteration and                     seasonality of production; and (5) to evaluate the accuracy and                 precision of sediment-based SST estimates.  The PIs will test the               accuracy and precision of the environmental  estimates in several               ways:  1) through the evaluation of environmental estimates made                on different subsets of the data; 2) through evaluation of                      different estimation techniques; and 3) through application of                  the sediment-derived environmental equations to sediment trap                   collection of foraminiferal assemblages.  The foraminiferal                     collections will be created at Brown University (core-top                       samples) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (sediment trap                samples).  The numerical data base will be made available to the                paleoclimatology, paleoceanography and paleobiology research                    communities through the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).                This research is important because it is science-driven data and                information management directed at the production of a global                   paleoclimate climate base for global change studies.",
