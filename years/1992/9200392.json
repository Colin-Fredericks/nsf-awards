 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colgate University undergraduates will conduct research on the             geologic histories of the Taconic Fold/Thrust Belt, the Cambro-                 Ordovician Platform, the Adirondack Massif, and the Maine coastal               volcanic province.  This area has served as a foundation for the                development of ideas relating plate teconic processes to the growth             of mountain belts.                                                                                                                                                   While the general geologic history and major processes are                 known, there remain many second-order problems that require                     resolution.  This project will examine a number of geological                   research projects that are both tractable to undergraduate juniors              and seniors and are of significance in refining our understanding               of the region.  Students will also have the opportunity to work on              problems related to aqueous geochemistry, clay mineralogy,                      paleontology and geomorphology.  All proposed summer projects will              be supervised by faculty at Colgate University, with additional                 fall-semester follow-up independent course work available at                    cooperating institutions.                                                                                                                                            A six-week orientation field program will be run prior to the              beginning of summer research projects as a requirement for all                  students who have not completed a geological field camp or related              field experience.  After the field course, students will select a               supervisor and research project for the next eight weeks.  Most                 projects will combine field and laboratory aspects.  All students               will be encouraged to continue their research following the summer              program and to prepare their results for possible publication.",
