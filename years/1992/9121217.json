 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mechanism of endogenous growth suitable for investigation of                  sectoral or regional interaction is developed.  The effects on                  steady state growth of consumption and production linkages between              sectors are assessed, and it is shown how the high value placed on              production linkages by economic historians might be reconciled with             the high value placed on openness (often implying lack of linkages)             by observers of contemporary less developed countries.  It is also              shown how sectors or regions interact out of steady state through               both product and labor markets, and in particular how if the former             interaction dominates one sector can be an \"engine of growth\"                   pulling along the other, while if the latter interaction dominates              one sector or region booms while the other declines.                                                                                                            By building on these results it is shown why liberalization of                  foreign trade should lead to a transition from a lower to a higher              steady state growth rate and why, during the course of this                     transition, growth might initially be even slower than before                   liberalization.  On this basis a reinterpretation of the post-1973              economic performance of Chile is offered.  An application to                    economic integration of previously separate regions or countries                shows that the largest growth effects are to be had if one region               is allowed to decline and provide a source of cheap labor for the               other region.  This study would make an important contribution to               our understanding of sectoral or regional interaction in response               to economic integration during the growth process.",
