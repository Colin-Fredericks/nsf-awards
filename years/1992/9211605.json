 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. T. Douglas Price, with a team of American and Danish                        collaborators, will conduct two years of archaeological                         research, which will constitute the second stage of                             a major, long term project.  The team will undertake                            archaeological excavation in the Saltbaek Vig region of                         eastern Denmark.  This area, typical of southern Scandinavia, is                known to contain sites from the \"Mesolithic\" (terminal hunting                  and gathering) and \"Neolithic\" (early farming) periods.  It has                 excellent preservation of archaeological remains.  During two                   field seasons, the team will excavate approximately 40 sites to                 distinguish those which date in the 3500 to 2500 B.C. range.  It is             during this time that the transition to agriculture took place.They             will also conduct paleoenvironmental studies in the area.  These                investigations will constitute the first systematic survey for                  Stone Age sites in Denmark, and help document changes in sea level,             temperature, and vegetation.                                                                                                                                    Approximately 5,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers appear suddenly in             southern Denmark, and they rapidly replace the Mesolithic hunter-               gatherer occupants.  While this fact is clear, the mechanisms                   involved in this transition are little understood.  It is not known             to what extent resident hunters and gatherers were replaced by new              populations or whether these groups rapidly changed their                       subsistence practices when new techniques, plants, and animals were             made available to them.  It seems that domestic plants and animals              were slow in coming to Denmark, but once they appeared, a rapid                 transition ensued.  Dr. Price and his colleagues will examine this              change and try to understand the mechanisms involved.                                                                                                           The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture                        constitutes perhaps the single most important advance in human                  prehistory.  Within very short periods of time, many populations                were exposed to a new mode of subsistence and underwent rapid                   social transformation.  By understanding this process,                          anthropologists can gain new insight into the plasticity of human               social organization and the mechanisms involved in rapid social                 change.  This research will provide insight into societies in                   isolated parts of the world who today are undergoing this same                  transformation.",
