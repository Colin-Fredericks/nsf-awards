 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will address the need for effective methods for               the study of the asymptotic behavior and fundamental limits that                occur in networking. The work will be restricted to stability                   problems in a multidimensional environment.  The definition of                  stability as used here is broad enough to cover many aspects of                 networking behavior such as boundness in probability (i.e.                      substability), limiting distributions, geometric ergodicity,                    strong stability, rate of convergence to table modes, finite                    moments and tails of the queue lengths and waiting time                         distributions, partial stability, robustness, cut-off phenomena,                shape of distributions, bistability, structural properties (e.g.                monotonicity of some parameters of interest), asymptotic                        performance, no-starvation regime for real time systems,                        practical stability, and sudden changes in network behavior. A                  stochastic approach is assumed through the project.  The research               will use new approaches  to the stability analysis of networking                that are based on a non-Markovian philosophy. The research will                 demonstrate that such an approach can rigorously provide                        stability criteria for such open problems as stability of                       multiaccess systems, token passing rings, FDDI, ATM networks,                   general network of queues, and so forth.",
