 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helicon waves are bounded electromagnetic waves in                              magnetized plasmas with frequencies between the ion                             cyclotron frequency wci and the electron                                        gyrofrequency wce which satisfy wci<<w<wce and                                  wwce<wpe2.  They are important because they are not                             limited by plasma density, and they represent a                                 relatively inexpensive technology that can be                                   employed in a growing list of applications which can                            take advantage of high plasma density.  These                                   include:  large radii RF ion lasers; plasma processing;                         sources of multi-charged ions for accelerators; in                              collective plasma accelerators; ion thrusters for                               spacecraft; and plasma sources for basic plasma                                 experiments.  The objective of these studies is the                             adaption of helicon sources to the efficient                                    production and heating of large steady-state high                               density plasmas (with densities of 1013cm-3 - 1014cm-3                          and higher), to explore the present applications and                            to find new applications.  Studies will include:                                control of the radial power deposition profile; the m                           = + 1 surface mode which has no density cutoff;                                 ponderomotive effects on source;                                                magnetohydrodynamic stability; the role of neutrals;                            and characteristics of pulsed sources.  Experiments                             will build on past experience with axisymmetric                                 mirror plasmas (e.g. ponderomotive force and                                    rotating field antennas which allow control of                                  azimuthal rf modes).  Theory will extend previous                               analytic theory to higher frequencies and take                                  advantage of extensive experience with the code                                 ANTENA to analyze rf field data.",
