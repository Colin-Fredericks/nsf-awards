 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single species are often envisioned as relatively uniform entities              that occupy a single \"niche.\"  Recently, however, ecologists have               discovered that single species can consist of multiple specialists              that occupy different niches.  Furthermore, ecological diversity                within species can be heavily influenced by other species in the                community.  The PIs will investigate this important subject in                  pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), whose geographical range                partially overlaps with the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis                           machrochirus).  Where they coexist, bluegill are ecological                     generalists that often feed on zooplankton, while pumpkinseed are               ecological specialists that feed primarily on snails.  In lakes                 without bluegill, however, pumpkinseeds exist as two morphological              forms, one of which feeds on zooplankton.  Thus, the ecological                 diversity that exists between species in areas of sympatry is                   replaced by a comparable degree of ecological diversity that exists             within species in allopatry.  From the standpoint of basic science,             the proposed research addresses fundamental questions involving                 coevolution, adaptive radiations, phenotypic plasticity, and                    speciation.  The research will also have practical implications,                especially by showing that intraspecific variation cannot be                    ignored in studies of biodiversity.",
