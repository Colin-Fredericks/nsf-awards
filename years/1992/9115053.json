 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the oldest questions in modern astronomy is: what is the                 percentage of stars accompanied by planetary systems?  The bridge               between low-mass stars and giant planets, such as Jupiter, is a                 class of objects called \"brown dwarfs.\"  Brown dwarfs shine at                  infrared (IR) wavelengths from energy released by slow gravi-                   tational contraction.  During the next three years the Principal                Investigator (PI) and his Co-Investigator will continue a long-term             and previously NSF-supported survey to search for brown dwarfs.                 Because brown dwarfs are not too much fainter than white dwarfs,                they will obtain electronic images of several hundred white dwarfs              with an IR camera and estimate the number of brown dwarfs among                 them.  They will also continue to monitor previously discovered                 brown-dwarf/white-dwarf systems to determine their orbital charac-              teristics and ultimately the masses of these objects.  It is                    expected that this and related studies will contribute                          significantly to our understanding of the formation of stars                    and planets, and in particular whether all these objects are                    products of the same formation process.",
