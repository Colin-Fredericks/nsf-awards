 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leguminosae is the third largest family of flowering plants, and                includes many ecologically and economically important species.  To              understand this great divesity it is necessary to describe the                  patterns of relationship and phylogeny linking the many species and             genera to one another.  Much work of this type has been done, and               continues, using traditional characters such as morphology and                  chemistry.   This study will focus on variation patterns at the DNA             level, specifically emphasizing the chloroplast genome, which has               proven to be of great utility as a source of characters for                     constructing phylogenetic hypotheses.  Restriction site analysis                and DNA sequencing will be used to survey genera representing all               of the major tribes of the pivotal subfamilies Papilionoideae and               Caesalpinioideae, the groups considered to represent the main                   radiation of the family.  Results from these studies will be                    integrated with those of non-molecular studies progressing                      elsewhere in the community.  The resulting phylogenetic hypotheses              will be used to study the origins of nitrogen-fixing symbioses in               the family, with emphasis on the development of the nuclear                     multigene families involved in nodulation.",
