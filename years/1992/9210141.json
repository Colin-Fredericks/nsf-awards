 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the content and isoforms of myosin in              the retina of green sunfish and zebrafish. These teleost fish                   contain three well-defined types of cells: rods, cones, and RPEs                (retinal pigmented epithelial cells). All three cell types show                 well-defined changes in response to light, darkness, and certain                chemicals. These shape changes occur both in the intact retina and              in isolated cells, and are known as retinomotor movements. Some of              the motility changes have been shown to be actin-dependent, so it               is likely that myosin is also involved. Myosin K/EDTA ATPase                    activity will be measured by standard techniques. Myosin will be                immunolocalized using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against               three types of non-muscle myosin, and monoclonal antibodies against             retinal myosin will also be prepared. Myosin isoform synthesis and              deposition will be determined in the developing retina; because of              the way the retina develops, the age and state of morphogenesis of              the various cell types can be easily determined.                                %%%                                                                             Fish retinas change more in response to light, darkness, and other              stimuli than mammalian retinas do. They provide a convenient system             for studying the possible role of myosin in the changes in cell                 shape. Actin has already been identified in fish retinal cells. In              non-muscle tissues, at least three types of myosin have been                    identified, which have markedly different properties. Antibodies to             these isoforms have been prepared. They will be used to determine               which form of myosin is present in each cell type, and where it is              localized. If retinal myosin is different from the known types,                 monoclonal antibodies will be prepared against it. Since the                    location of cells is well-characterized during retinal development,             the antibodies will be used to see whether isoforms change during               this time. Since myosin-based cell motility is important for many               life processes, it is likely that the results will apply to other               systems as well.",
