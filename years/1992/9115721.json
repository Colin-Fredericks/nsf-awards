 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the astronomical research, technological                    development, and student training carried out at the Five College               Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO).  The research program includes             studies of external galaxies, star formation, the dense                         interstellar medium, astrochemistry, the late stages of stellar                 evolution, and planetary science.  The Observatory also plays a                 major role in education, with 45 graduate and undergraduate                     students from 13 universities having carried out research projects              at the facility during the past three year period.  FCRAO has                   recently brought into operation a focal plane array of receivers                for use at a wavelength of 3 millimeters; the first of its kind on              any telescope.                                                                                                                                                  Over the next three years this group will expand the spectroscopic              capability of the array through construction of an autocorrelation              spectrometer.  As an initial step toward construction of larger                 focal plane arrays, development work on high electron mobility                  transister amplifiers will be carried out.  Among the scientific                programs to be carried out are maps of a large number of                        transitions of molecules to examine the coupled physics, chemistry              and kinematics of the dense interstellar medium in our Galaxy;                  large scale, good angular resolution maps of molecular clouds to                study the relationship of star formation to angular momentum                    content and structure on a heirarchy of scales;  fully sampled maps             of the molecular distribution in many spiral galaxies in order to               study the process of star formation in these systems; and                       participation in VLBI experiments to probe the inner structure of               quasars and active galactic nuclei.",
