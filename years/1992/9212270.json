 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies a vesicular membrane based biomimetic                     system for removing hazardous metals cation from aqueous                        streams.  In preliminary work, the PI has used equilibrium                      detergent dialysis to fabricate unilamellar vesicles made of                    soybean phosphatidylcholine harboring a lipophilic metal                        carrier, the ionophone A23187, in the vesicle membrane, and a                   chelating agent (NTA, nitrilotiacetate) in the vesicle                          interior.  When the vesicle dispersion is mixed with an                         aqueous solution containing the metal cations, the cations                      become bound to the metal carrier in the membrane.  The                         complex is soluble in the membrane, and it diffuses across the                  lamella to the inside surface of the membrane vesicle where                     the metal ion is released.  The released ion complexes with                     the chelator, thereby keeping the concentration of the ion-                     lipophile complex at the inside surface of the vesicle                          membrane extremely small.  With this value small, the driving                   force for diffusion of additional complexes of the ion and the                  lipophile remains large, and the vesicle continues to strongly                  uptake the metal ions.  Results of batch experiments in which                   the vesicles were mixed solutions containing only Cu(II),                       Cd(II), or Pb(II) cations demonstrate that the vesicles are                     effective scavengers of these metal ions with rapid uptake and                  high loading.                                                                                                                                                   The primary problem with this technique is the high cost of                     the lipophilic carrier and the phosphidylcholine.  The                          proposed research will explore less costly lipophilic carriers                  such as cleft type metal binding agents and crown ether-based                   agents, and less costly components for the vesicles such as                     alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants.  Competitive metal ion                     uptake will also be studied, and a bench scale continuous                       metal recovery system will be tested which uses hollow fiber                    membrane cartridges to contact the vesicle dispersion and the                   waste stream in a countercurrent mode.",
