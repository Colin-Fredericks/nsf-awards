 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of metal ions on the hydrolysis of a series of                       carboxyl substituted esters and amides will be studied to allow                 a chemical assessment of the mechanistic possibilities for the                  metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A.  In this work all of the                      currently recognized possibilities will be investigated in                      systems of known mechanism so that a quantitative evaluation                    may be made of the effects on the rate constants of: (1) the                    identity of the metal ion, (2) the strength of binding of the                   metal ion to either the carbonyl oxygen or the leaving group,                   (3) the pKa of the leaving group, and (4) the steric fit of the                 carboxyl group to the carbonyl.                                                 In conjunction with the chemical work a kinetic investigation                   of carboxypeptidase A will be carried out employing new types                   of substrates with which the leaving group can be varied.  This                 should permit a clear distinction between nucleophilic and                      general base mechanisms involving the carboxyl group of Glu-                    270.  Employing these and also more conventional ester and                      peptide substrates, conformational effect will be investigated                  in temperature-jump, stopped-flow studies and in inhibition                     studies. The latter experiments will give information on the                    nature and identity of the sites in which esters, peptides, and                 inhibitors bind.  Thus, this work should lead to an                             understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of this important                   metalloenzyme.",
