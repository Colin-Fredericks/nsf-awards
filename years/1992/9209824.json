The                MVCOPQLF is derived from a newly developed framework, known as the              Cost of Poor Quality Matrix.  This framework integrates established             cost of quality concepts with the intent of Taguchi's Loss Function             model.  Production scheduling results generated from MVCOPQLfs will             be tested for sensitivity to transition paths and performance                   characteristic target values.  Applications of the MVCOPQLF is a                discrete parts manufacturing facility will also be modeled and                  demonstrated.                                                                        The anticipated result is the advancement of the understanding             and practicability of the loss function concept to one which may                be used in industry to evaluate and optimize a wide range of                    operating decisions.  Completion of this research will elevate the              loss function concept to one which may, if properly implemented,                substantially advance the way producers look at manufacturing                   activities -- a level where explicit consideration of cost of poor              quality yields positive long-term results, and far less loss to                 society as a whole.                                                               //",
