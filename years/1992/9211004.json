 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop algorithms for                 implementing a software distributed shared memory that reduce both the          number of messages and the amount of data transferred between                   processors.  A software distributed shared memory (DSM) enables                 processes to share memory even when they execute on processors that             only communicate via message-passing.  In recent years, the developers          of tightly-coupled multiprocessors have adopted relaxed memory                  consistency models to reduce the latency of remote memory access.               However, in a distributed memory multiprocessor, it is equally                  important to reduce the number of messages used for remote memory               access.  The principal investigator has developed an algorithm that             implements a well known form of relaxed memory called Release                   Consistency.  This algorithm, called Lazy Release Consistency,                  differs from most previous work because it is designed specifically             for software DSM, rather then being an imitation of hardware                    implementations.  Our preliminary results using trace-driven                    simulation   indicate that Lazy Release Consistency significantly               reduces both the number of messages and the amount of data transferred          between processors.  In order to reduce communication, Lazy Release             Consistency performs more computation.  To  assess the impact of this           trade-off, Lazy Release Consistency is being implemented in the Munin           DSM and application program performance compared to previous work.",
