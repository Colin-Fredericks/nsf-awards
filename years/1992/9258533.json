 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two lines of research will be pursued.  The first is to develop a             hybrid symbolic-numeric system for solving systems of polynomial                equations numerically.  For this, symbolic algorithms for global root           separation will be combined with local numerical methods for root               refinement.  One task in the project is to determine the feasibility            of a hybrid Groebner basis routine which may deal with inputs more              general than ordinary polynomials.  The quotient algebra module is              noteworthy because it reduces both the computation of resultants (for           general algebraic feasibility ) and the computation of trace forms              (for real root location).  The other modules build up, layer by layer,          the tools necessary to effectively isolate and refine all solutions of          a system of polynomial equations.                                                 The second research direction is to analyze the structure of sparse           resultants.  Sparse polynomials arise frequently in important                   applications, so computational advances in dealing with them have much          practical significance.  It is planned to investigate resultant                 equations for systems of sparse Laurent polynomials.  There are                 important relationships between the combinatorics of parameters                 associated with such systems and the solutions of polynomial                    equations.  Any knowledge of such structure feeds back into                     computational methods, e.g., limiting a priori the types of systems             which may have solutions of various sorts.",
