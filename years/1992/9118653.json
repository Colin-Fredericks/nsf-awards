 "awd_abstract_narration": "All biological production and consumption of methane (a                    greenhouse gas) is due to bacterial metabolism.  Methanothrophs are             bacteria that use methane as a sole source of carbon and energy.                Unlike most bacteria that lack internal membrane structure, the                 methanotrophs have an intracytoplasmic membrane that is suggested               to play a role in the metabolism of one carbon compounds.  The                  presence and structure of this membrane is subject to regulation                making methanotrophs an attractive model system for studies of                  membrane biology.  In the proposed study, the effect of                         environmental stimuli on intracytoplasmic membrane formation and                other aspects of methanotroph cell biology will be evaluated.  In               cell fractionation studies, intracytoplasmic membranes and other                subcellular fractions will be isolated and characterized to                     elucidate their role in one carbon metabolism.  These experiments               will form the basis of other studies in which the details of the                cellular response to environmental stimuli and membrane development             are investigated.                                                                                                                                                    The proposed research should contribute to our understanding               of cell biology through studies in a methanotrophic bacteric model              system.  Additionally, these studies should provide information                 that will be useful for other purposes since methanotrophs are                  important in the biotechnology industry due to numerous potential               applications including biotransformation and biodegradation.  This              research will facilitate biotechnological exploitation of                       methanotrophs.  //",
