In                                             order to meet the purity                                                        requirements for human therapeutic                                              use, the biotechnology industry                                                 employs state-of-the-art separation                                             techniques borrowed from protein                                                chemistry.  Among the highest                                                   resolution separation processes is                                              high performance liquid                                                         chromatography (HPLC), which has                                                found a limited use on a large                                                  scale for purification of proteins.                                             The main features impeding broader                                              acceptance of process scale HPLC                                                purification, in addition to the                                                high cost of columns and equipment,                                             are the large solvent volumes, low                                              column capacity and loss of                                                     biological activity, particularly                                               for proteins that irreversibly                                                  denature or aggregate at the                                                    concentrations, and under the                                                   conditions encountered during                                                   typical chromatographic operations.                                             Displacement chromatography is an                                               alternative to yield much higher                                                throughput, more efficient                                                      utilization of stationary and                                                   mobile phases, and high resolution.                                             In addition, displacement                                                       chromatography can be performed on                                              conventional ion exchange and                                                   reversed phase chromatography                                                   columns, does not require the                                                   expensive production of exotic                                                  column reagents as do affinity                                                  separation techniques, and it                                                   involves operating steps that are                                               readily scaled up.",
