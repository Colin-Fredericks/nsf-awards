 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research on problems in                Fourier analysis and partial differential equations which are                   related to the wave equation and microlocal analysis.  Included                 are efforts to prove sharp norm-local smoothing estimates for the               wave equation in two dimensions, improving those obtained for                   dispersive equations.  Newly designed methods of microlocal                     analysis will play a major role here.  A primary application                    envisioned concerns embedding results for the spherical wave                    equation, establishing regularity properties of periodic                        solutions to nonlinear wave equations and possibly proving local                decay estimates for solutions to initial value problems for                     hyperbolic operators with a potential.                                               A second project involves the Lebesgue and Hardy space                     mapping properties of Fourier-Airy operators and efforts to prove               sharp estimates for solutions to the wave equation in manifolds                 with geodesically concave or convex boundaries.  This would                     extend recent results on Fourier integral operators which are                   locally a graph.  The obstacle which must be overcome is presence               of oscillatory integrals with singular phase functions.  This                   makes standard plane wave decompositions of solutions much more                 delicate.                                                                            The model for all of these problems is the study of Fourier                integral operators having the property that the projections from                the canonical relation to the cotangent spaces have Whitney                     folding singularities.                                                               Work on this project concerns fundamental mathematical tools               related to the study of differential equations.  The equations                  are used to model natural phenomena and predict their changing                  characteristics as they evolve in time and space.",
