 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to produce high performance electronic devices by                   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is critically                    dependent on reagent purity and deposition chemistry.  MOCVD                    based metallization processes are also strongly affected by                     reagent cost.  The ideal aluminum MOCVD reagent would meet the                  demands of high purity and chemical compatibility required for                  electronic film growth yet be economically attractive for                       metallization applications.  Alane:trimethylamine                               (AlH3:N(CH3)3) is a promising aluminum reagent both for MOCVD                   of aluminum gallium arsenide films and metallization.                           Widespread adoption of this reagent has been hindered by                        concerns about purity and cost.  Alane:trimethylamine is                        currently purified by sublimation, a time-consuming process                     difficult to scale up.  In Phase I, alane:trimethylamine will                   be purified using supercritical fluid (SCF)                                     extraction/recrystallization.  A high pressure synthesis of                     alane:trimethylamine in the same SCF medium used for                            extraction will also be performed to demonstrate feasibility                    of combining high pressure synthesis with SCF extraction.  In                   Phase II, production scale methodology will be developed and                    this novel combination of techniques will be profilerated to a                  broad range of semiconductor grade reagents.                                                                                                                    Supercritical fluid technology may provide a means of coupling                  the synthesis and purification of alane:trimethylamine in one                   process.  This process could supply higher purity, lower cost,                  alane:trimethylamine for the electronics industry.",
