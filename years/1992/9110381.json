Little formal research                                  exists to assist in the analysis of the proper soil                             improvement technique to use, though many                                       advances have occurred through innovative                                       construction techniques developed by specialty                                  contractors.

The objective of this                                             collaboration is to study the behavior of                                       treated soils subjected to high strain cyclic                                   loads such as those experienced during                                          earthquakes.  Dynamic properties, that is,                                      shear moduli and damping characteristics, of                                    both admixture and grout-treated soils are                                      being investigated to assess: a) the potential of                               soil treatment as a viable option in the                                        mitigation of earthquake hazards, and b) the                                    response of existing treated soil-structure                                     systems to earthquake loads.",
