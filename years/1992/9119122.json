 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this Dissertation Improvement research is to                study affiliative patterns and social relationships in adult male               ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) in Madagascar.  This is a                       particularly interesting species for such study as the ringtailed               lemur is characterized by female dominance, multimale organization              and male migration in contrast to the patterns found in many of the             other primates.                                                                                                                                                 Data will be collected on the frequency and nature of affiliative               behaviors between males and between males and females over the                  period of 14 months; thus covering annual temporal variation.  The              information obtained will be related to the seasonal reproductive               behavior patterns, seasonal variation and the female dominance                  found in this species.  This will be the first detailed examination             of male social relationships in a female dominant primate.",
