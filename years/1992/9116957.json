 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Bernard Wailes, Ms Helen Loney will                  collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  She will analyze                   ceramic materials collected from Bronze Age sites located in the                area around Lazio in the Apennine region of Italy.  Samples will                cover the entire Bronze Age which dates from ca. 1600 BC to 900                 BC and which documents the rise of social complexity in this                    region.  The project has three goals: 1. To build a descriptive                 catalogue of the technological development of pottery during the                Bronze Age. 2. To compare the physical evidence of manufacturing                techniques to current ceramic typologies which are based on                     decoration and form. 3. To relate these developments to other                   economic and political developments in this region and to                       correlate these with changes across a broader area.  Materials                  from four sites will be subjected to Xeroradiography and X-rays                 which will produce a transparent record of the production and                   manufacturing techniques.                                                                                                                                       Because archaeologists must work primarily with material remains                such as pottery, they are extremely interested in the way that                  technological development in the material realm is related to                   other societal attributes which cannot be directly observed.                    Therefore, through study of objects one can hopefully reconstruct               other aspects of culture and social organization.  The Bronze Age               in Italy records the transformation of small locally organized                  groups into a more highly integrated and hierarchically organized               society.  Within this controlled context, Ms Loney wishes to                    analyze ceramic remains and see how closely changes and variation               in manufacturing style reflect changes in this broader context.                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to many Europeanist archaeologists.  It will                   also, hopefully, result in the development of a methodology which               can be applied in other situations.  Finally, it will assist in                 the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
