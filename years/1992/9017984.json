They share a common goal of potential                          cooperative research in earthquake prediction and                               statistical modelling and analysis.  They anticipate a                          technical report describing for U.S. readers the algorithm                      \"M8\" as it was used to obtain the claimed prediction of                         the Loma Prieta event.  This report will include a self-                        contained description of the features of the seismic                            record used and an account of all the parameters fitted.                        The understanding obtained in this effort will provide the                      basis for future efforts to adapt modern statistical                            methods to emperical earthquake prediction and validation.                                                                                                      This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                   complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                       mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                            scientific research on the basis of equality, reciptocity,                      and mutuality of benefit.//",
