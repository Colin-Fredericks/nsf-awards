 "awd_abstract_narration": "This national pilot program builds on an earlier project, and                   provides an additional three workshops for experienced                          community college physics teachers.  These workshops are                        scheduled during 1992 at three geographically-dispersed                         community college campuses.  Two workshops cover the use of                     microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL).  The other workshop                     deals with conceptual exercises (CE) and overview case studies                  (OCS) which apply the findings of cognitive physics                             research.Each three-day workshop is led by two                                  university/college physics professors who play a major role in                  these areas.  These hands-on workshops facilitate the                           incorporation of this new knowledge at community colleges.  The                 impact of the workshops is reinforced by the establishment of                   a networking system employing a telecommunications bulletin                     board system and a newsletter.  The ultimate purpose of this                    project is to help community college students develop a                         stronger understanding of classical and contemporary physics.                   The task of updating physics programs at community colleges is                  difficult but essential for the nation and for science because                  of the large number of students, particularly women and                         minorities, attending community colleges.",
