 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Kentucky will enhance the research                     competitiveness of approximately 64 faculty within 19                           departments at three universities (University of Kentucky,                      University of Louisville, and Western Kentucky University).                     Research areas include:  (1) Developing a Center for                            Evolutionary Ecology; (2) Biofunctional Membranes; (3)                          Structural Biology of Cellular Regulators; (4) Applications of                  Massively Parallel Computers; (5) Radiation, Turbulence, and                    Chemical Kinetics Interactions in Flames; (6) Inverse Problems                  and Quantitative Non-destructive Evaluation; (7) The                            Relationship Between Structure and Activity in Chemical                         Catalysis;  Synthesis, Structure, and Function; (8) Local                       Approach to Study the Properties of Complex Systems with Low                    Symmetry; and (9) Preparation and Properties of Low-                            Dimensional Conductors and their Intercalates.  The research                    clusters will serve over one hundred graduate, undergraduate,                   and post doctoral students.  In addition, EPSCoR outreach                       activities are linked with the existing educational enrichment                  programs in the state in which cluster members are actively                     involved (e.g., the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in                   Engineering at the University of Louisville; SuperQuest; and                    the Minority High School Research Apprenticeship Program).                      The State of Kentucky will contribute over $11 million in                       support of the EPSCoR initiative.",
