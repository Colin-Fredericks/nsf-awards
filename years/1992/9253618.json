 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at the continued                                         development of and student training in                                          high resolution soft x-ray optical techniques                                   for microscopy and lithography.  Using an                                       undulator at the National Synchrotron Light                                     Source at nearby Brookhaven National                                            Laboratory, we are able to obtain coherent                                      beams of x-rays with a wavelength of 1-5                                        nm (the wavelength of visible light is 400-                                     700 nm).  The PI has developed a                                                scanning x-ray microscope which focusses                                        these soft x-rays to a 50 nm spot, and this                                     microscope is being used both for                                               transmission microscopy studies of wet,                                         thick biological specimens, and for the                                         development of new imaging modalities.                                          The PI has also demonstrated the ability to                                     record x-ray holograms of biological                                            specimens at 50 nm resolution, and our                                          efforts in holography and developments at                                       laser labs are leading towards the goal of                                      recording 20 nm resolution holograms with                                       psec exposure times, thus imaging a                                             specimen in a timescale shorter than that                                       of radiation damage.  Finally, the PI has                                       also developed a method for designing                                           masks for x-ray lithographic manufacture of                                     future integrated circuits based on                                             referenceless on-axis computed                                                  holograms; it is hoped to bring this method                                     from computer simulation to experimental                                        demonstration.",
