 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portland State University of the Oregon State System of Higher             Education, is ideally suited to conduct a field and laboratory                  project in the Lake Owyhee volcanics in eastern Oregon.  Students               will conduct geologic mapping and topic-specific research on                    volcanic, volcaniclastic, clastic, and hydrothermally altered                   rocks.  The studies will focus on relations among volcanism,                    sedimentation in fault-controlled basins, and hydrothermal activity             in a Miocene continental rift environment.                                                                                                                           Students will participate for 10 weeks during the summer.  The             first six and one-half weeks will be spent on the field portion,                the next two on laboratory studies, and the final weeks will be                 spent in writing and revising reports already partially prepared                in the field.  The reports will summarize the research topic, field             data, and will discuss the findings in light of available                       literature.                                                                                                                                                          Follow up activities will focus on revision of the student                 reports in preparation for presentation of the findings in a                    seminar in the student's home department and as a paper/poster at               a scientific meeting.  Students with particularly interesting                   findings will be encouraged to prepare jointly authored papers for              publication.",
