 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been recognized that physics graduates progressing to                    careers in experimental physics in industry or to studies for                   a higher degree, need on-the-job training in the design and                     planning stage of experiments.   More often than not this                       training is haphazard, with a good chance that the trainee is                   self-taught.  We believe that the education of our majors will                  be more complete if their first planning and design assignments                 are performed with an oversight and feedback from faculty, in                   a formal course setting.  To meet this need we have inaugurated                 an experimental physics design lab for seniors.  A core of                      equipment has been assembled for the course, and more apparatus                 is being brought into the laboratory to bring it to its planned                 stage.  The main goals of the teaching mode for the course are                  to develop initiative, and to instill in the students the need                  for sound design and planning of experiments.  The choice of                    experiments is based on a number of factors; utilization of a                   physical principle or technique of wide applicability,                          available equipment, and non-overlap with experiments in                        preceding laboratory courses.  The experiments chosen also are                  somewhat open-ended, to meet the goals of the teaching mode.",
