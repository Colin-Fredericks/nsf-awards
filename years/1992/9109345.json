 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate theoretical and computational aspects of          a class of nonsmooth equations involving functions called normal maps.          These normal maps express the necessary conditions for solution of              optimization or equilibrium problems, so solving an equation involving          such a function amounts to satisfying the necessary conditions for              solution of optimization or for equilibrium.  A great many practical            problems involve the solution of such problems, so the proposed work,           if successful, would have substantial practical utility.  Generally             nonsmooth normal maps have a considerable amount of structure, and              much of the first-order local theory of differentiable functions has            already been extended to these maps.                                                                                                                            On the theoretical side, several global topological aspects of such             functions will be investigated.  In particular, special conditions              will be studied under which normal maps will be homeomorphisms, in              order to investigate more generally, the nature of their critical               values, and to explore the possibility of extending global homotopy             approaches from equations containing smooth functions to those                  involving normal maps.                                                                                                                                          On the computation side, some of the embedding and homotopy methods             will be implemented to investigate their numerical behavior.  These             computational investigations will be aimed particularly at producing            methods that could help in solving hard nonlinear optimization or               equilibrium problems for which good starting values are not available.",
