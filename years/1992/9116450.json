 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lignocellulose is a major component of intertidal vascular plants               and resulting detritus. It is a quantitatively important, although              highly refractory, store of organic matter in coastal wetland                   environments such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps.  As such, it             represents a major source of carbon and energy to marine food webs,             although microbially mediated transformations to particulate and                dissolved degradation products or microbial biomass are required                before the carbon from this abundant organic polymer can be                     utilized by metazoans.                                                                                                                                          As lignocellulose is degraded by natural marine microbial                       populations, a significant fraction (as high as 20-50%) of the                  total degradation products is released into the bulk pool of                    dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Importantly, up to half of this                lignocellulose-derived DOC (LC-DOC) fits the operational definition             of \"humic\" material.  Recent geochemical studies have shown that                humic material originating in vascular plant-dominated aquatic                  systems is compositionally distinct from humics originating in                  plankton-dominated pelagic systems.  Humic material has                         traditionally been considered to be highly recalcitrant to                      microbial transformation and thus, implicitly, not to be a                      significant carbon and/or energy source fueling bacterioplankton                secondary production.  This assumption has not yet been directly                challenged experimentally in marine ecosystems, although there is               evidence that bacterioplankton production at the expense of the                 humic component of DOC can be trophodynamically important in some               systems, and that availability may be related to the source (and                chemical composition) of the humic substances.  This project                    involves field and laboratory studies to improve our understanding              of the formation of dissolved humic substances from vascular plant              lignocelluloses and determine the importance of LC-derived and                  natural marine humics in the support of bacterioplankton                        production.",
