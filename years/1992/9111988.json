 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, users have difficulties in retrieving information                  which is stored in different types of database systems. Most users              are not familiar with different query languages and may not be                  aware of the locations of data. The objective of this project is to             facilitate query formulation and to speed up query processing in                heterogeneous database environments, i.e. where different types of              database systems, specifically, relational, object-oriented,                    deductive, and textual systems co-exist in an organization or                   across different organizations. To enable a user who is familiar                with only a single query language to access information stored in               different types of database systems, translators of query languages             are being built.  An intelligent data dictionary is constructed to              facilitate schema integration and query translation.  Query                     processing performance is optimized  by application of logic-based              methods, using knowledge about the types of queries previously                  processed. Parallel processing techniques across different systems              are employed to provide further speedup.  The resulting                         heterogeneous query processing system will find wide applicability              as the networking of different database systems becomes widespread.",
