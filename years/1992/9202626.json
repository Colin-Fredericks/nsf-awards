At the Vancouver meeting, ASZ will assemble together with the                   Canadian Society of Zoologists, providing an international forum.               The symposium addresses a growing problem in conservation                       biology:  the relatively small attention given to major problems                in invertebrate conservation across some 28 phyla and all major                 earth habitat types.  There will be eleven speakers, each                       addressing an urgent topic.  They will discuss the effects of                   environmental alteration, pollution, introduced species and over                harvesting on many invertebrate phyla from habitats as diverse as               coral reefs, temperate rocky coasts, fresh water streams and                    lakes, and temperate and tropical forests.  The symposium will                  dramatize the crisis to a broad audience, facilitate exchange of                ideas, concerns and approaches to dealing with invertebrate                     conservation, and stimulate much needed action in the area of                   invertebrate conservation biology.",
