 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some insect parasites inject secretions into the host along with                their egg which results in avoiding immune defenses and causes host             developmental arrest.  For Campoletis sonorensis, both phenomena                may be induced by a polydnavirus (PDV).  PDV is the only animal DNA             virus with a heterogeneous, segmented genome.  Several viral gene               families have been identified that are expressed during parasitism,             and viral gene expression is tissue and/or host specific.  Through              evolution the parasite has acquired to assemble, amplify and                    transfer this genetic information in a viral form to another                    eucaryotic host which is essential for parasite survival.                       We have shown one family of the venom related (VR) wasp and PDV                 genes encode structural motifs that belong to \"DEAD\" protein                    family.  This suggests that these unique genes may encode products              involved in regulating, splicing or translation.  Our recent                    studies show also that CsPDV genes contain sequences that encode                a cysteine motif characteristic of peptide toxins.  The presence                of this motif is unlikely to be fortuitous,  rather it may reflect              a function as a ligand of cell surface receptors which may also be              correlated with functions related to parasite survival.  The                    significance of this study emphasizes the molecular basis of                    parasite induced avoidance of insect defense systems and the                    research conducted with NSF support will be directed to identifying             these expression products and determining their functional                      significance.",
