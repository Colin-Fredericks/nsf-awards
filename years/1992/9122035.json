 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the phase II work proposed research we will determine the                    overlapping relationships between-10,000 clones from a cosmid                   library derived from partially-digested, chromosome-sorted human                DNA.  This information will allow the creation of an ordered                    chromosome specific library.  This library, and others to follow,               will be indispensable tools for the human genome mapping and                    sequencing project.  The phase II work will create an ordered                   cosmid library as well as kits, devices, and instruction manuals                that can be used by other investigators to accomplish the same                  result on segments of DNA as large as entire human chromosomes.                 The phase II work involves cross-hybridization of the inserts from              a large number of cosmid clones to each other independently in all              combinations using the \"pen-line\" method developed in phase I work.             The \"pen-line\" method allows discrete hybridization of all cloned               DNAs separately and independently to all probes generated from the              same set clones and, therefore, allows for simultaneous                         determination of the overlap between all clones in the set.  The                method is several fold faster than current repeatable  protocol.                In phase II work, we propose to use the method on an overlapping                clone library derived from chromosome 20.",
