 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to identify factors                       responsible for arrested succession in old-fields in a tropical                 rainforest in Mexico.  Four arrested old-fields will be compared                                                                                                with four fields in late succession, defined by the abundance of                                                                                                the indicator species of late succession, Cecropia obtusifolia.                                                                                                 The factors involved in its absence in arrested fields will be                  investigated from the seed to the sapling stage.  Soil seed bank                                                                                                and its viability will be compared between arrested and                         non-arrested stages.  Space availability as potential                           colonization                                                                    sites will equally be compared.  Sown seeds, following two                      different densities, will be followed to determine removal by                   predators and seed viability.  These will be compared between                   stages.  Growth and survival of the seedlings will be compared                  between arrested and non-arrested sites, until they reach the                   sapling stage.  Microclimatic and edaphic conditions will be                    monitored for possible correlation with growth and survival of                  the                                                                             seedlings.  Factors preventing C. obtusifolia from occurring in                 arrested sites may indicate forces detaining succession, which                  are                                                                             important to control fallow periods in traditional agriculture.",
