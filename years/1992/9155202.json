The project will create a partnership with Santa                     Ana Unified School District, which has a high enrollment of                     minority and Limited English Proficiency students.  One half                    of the participants will be drawn from Lowell Elementary, a                     school with one of the highest minority enrollments and lowest                  mathematics achievement scores in the district.  The other                      participants will come from other schools in the district.                      Participants will attend 25 four-hour sessions throughout the                   school year for each of two years.  They will receive in-                       school support between sessions by specialists funded by the                    grant and by the school district, as well as by peers who have                  been involved in previous programs in the district.  The                        project intends to help teachers improve their skills in                        mathematics and mathematics teaching and support success of                     ethnic minority children in mathematics through a focus on use                  the language of mathematics in problem solving, new content,                    and emphasis on higher order reasoning.                                                                                                                         California State University, Fullerton, and the Santa Ana                       Unified School District are contributing a 71% cost share for                   the project.",
