Integrated circuit (IC) design is now  dominated by wires which can no longer be considered as perfect  conductors.         The long term goal of this research is to find a new CAD  methodology for designing high-performance large and dense  circuits which have a large portion of the physical layout  occupied by the wires.  New algorithms with major emphasis on  ability to handle efficiently very large problem instances are  being developed.  These include algorithms for the problem of  extended floor-planning; such as, performance-driven  partitioning, timing simulation including transmission lines,  clock skew optimization, routing and compaction.  Also being  developed are algorithms to solve problems which span the  boundaries of several of these classical problems and explore  dependencies which were previously not studied.  Much of this  research is common to high performance design of both  high-density chips and multichip modules.",
