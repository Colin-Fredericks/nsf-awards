DEDS are typified by networks for                communications, manufacturing, computer traffic, and other systems              governed by man-made rules.  As a paradigm change is ripe to take               place in the study of these systems, perhaps similar to the major               conceptual advances that occurred during the Sputnik era in control             system theory, new methods for design, control, and optimization                are needed.  The major focus of this award is to bring research                 results in DEDS into the classroom.  This effort includes the                   development of new courses and a simulation-based instructional                 \"electronic\" laboratory, and an innovative approach for the                     dissemination of the project  results that exploits recent advances             in educational technology.",
