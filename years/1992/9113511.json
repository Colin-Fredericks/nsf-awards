 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Significant body of empirical studies indicated that                     continental-scale climate anomalies play an important part in                   determining the variability of the African climate.  One of these               decadal-scale climate anomaly regimes concerns the simultaneous                 phase reversal, in the precipitation anomaly distribution,                      between equatorial and tropical Africa.  This continental-scale                 concurrence happens despite the fact that the rainy season in                   each latitudinal band over the continent comes at different                     phases of the annual cycle.  Clearly, a continental-scale                       teleconnection mechanism appears to be involved in the                          development and maintenance of these climatic conditions.  The                  PI's solutions obtained form a steady-state multi-level linear                  model, indicate that the interaction between the large-scale                    African orography and the climatic fluctuations in the basic                    state could help to produce the observed teleconnections in the                 African climate.  The PI will extend his previous investigations                by performing a series of numerical simulations based on the NCAR               Community Climate Model (CCM).                                                                                                                                  This investigation will be aimed at two distinct but closely                    related and complementary objectives which may be stated as                     follows. (1) Employ the National Center for Atmospheric Research                (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) to investigate the observed                three-way connection between the global sea surface temperature                 (SST), the continental-scale teleconnections in the African                     climate, and the regional Sahelian droughts.  The numerical                     integrations will be based on two versions of the NCAR GCM, an                  earlier model designated CCM1, and a new version CCM2, in which                 extensive enhancements have been implemented.  (2) Introduce and                test a new hypothesis concerning the role of the interaction                    between the large-scale orography of Africa and the mean zonal                  flow in promoting the observed teleconnections in the African                   climate.                                                                                                                                                        Through this investigation the PI hopes to clarify some of the                  important physical mechanisms responsible for the continental-                  scale teleconnections in the African climate.  In addition this                 study will help to assess the relative performances of CCM1 and                 CCM2 in simulating the variability of the tropical climate, thus                contributing toward further improvements in the models.",
