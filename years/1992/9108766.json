 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Maine is conducted by the Maine                        Science and Technology Commission, with input from the                          Research Excellence Partnership.  Maine EPSCoR will enhance                     the research competitiveness of over 20 investigators                           working in three research clusters:  (1) Marine Molecular                       Biology Research Cluster; and (2) Wood Sciences and                             Engineering Research Center (3) Global Environmental Change                     Center.  Collaborations are proposed among scientists at the                    University of Maine; the Mount Desert Island Biological                         Laboratory; the State Geological Survey; the Bigelow                            Laboratory for Ocean Studies, and the Maine Department of                       Marine Resources.  The three research areas, which were                         selected on their scientific merits, are of importance to                       the State of Maine in terms of research excellence, human                       resource development, and opportunities for economic                            vitality.  The objectives for the Maine Advanced Development                    Program are: (1) to develop and implement a long range plan                     for integrating S&E research, education, and development                        into the state's economic development strategy; (2) increase                    awareness and importance of science and engineering; (3)                        build and retain technical expertise; and (4) expand state                      support for research.                                                                                                                                           Over the three-year award period the State of Maine will                        contribute over $5 million to ensure the success of the                         EPSCoR effort.",
