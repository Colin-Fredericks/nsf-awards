While much of connectionist research has addressed problems and                 data from cognitive  psychology, SSP has focused on complementary               data and problems in higher cognition  that are centrally located               in linguistics and the foundations of cognitive science.  SSP has               already made significant progress, including (a) mathematical                   techniques for representing  symbolic structures as lower-level                 distributed patterns of activity and for (b) performing                         massively parallel structure-sensitive processing on such                       representations; (c) the analysis  of connectionist computation                 as maximizing Harmony, a well-formedness measure on                             representations; (d) contributions to theoretical linguistics in                the areas of syntax/semantics  and phonology that rely on using                 Harmony to measure the well-formedness of linguistic  structures;               and (e) contributions to the foundations of cognitive science                   deriving from the  interpretation of the preceding results.                                                                                                     The new research to be supported by the present grant will build                on (d), expanding the  theory of grammar as a well-formedness                   optimizing system, and on (e), systematically  developing a                     typology of strategies for connectionist-grounded explanations of               the striking  productivity of human higher cognition.                                                                                                           SSP is contributing to the development of a new methodology for                 cognitive science which  is more than just the sum of those of                  its sister disciplines, a methodology capable of  yielding                      results which are beyond the reach of all the other disciplines                 proceeding  individually.  By integrating linguistic,                           philosophical, and mathematical analysis, computer  simulation,                 and techniques from both discrete and continuous computation,                   this new  methodology can develop more powerful connectionist                   systems, innovative symbolic  formalisms, and general cognitive                 principles that constitute real progress towards the  unification               of connectionist and symbolic theories of brain and mind.",
