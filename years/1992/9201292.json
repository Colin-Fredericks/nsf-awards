 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major control point for the interaction among photosynthesis,                 photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration is the pyruvate                  dehydrogenase complex (PDC).  The objectives of this research are               to characterize events, mechanisms and modulators of PDC activity               during development and photosynthesis in C3, C4, and CAM plants;                extend biochemical characterization of PDC; establish in vitro and              in situ regulatory mechanisms; examine the long term regulation of              PDC; and study the expression of PDC's component enzymes, their                 import and complex assembly.  We seek to establish conditions and               metabolites that affect reversible phosphorylation of the                       mitochondrial PDC using purified, functional mitochondria coupled               with inhibitors, altered metabolite levels and physiological                    environments.  Antibodies, isotope labeling and enzyme activity                 measurements will be used to quantitate enzyme forms.  Standard                 techniques will be used to clone to PDH components of PDC.  Import              and assembly studies will utilize our knowledge of a model protein              and an Hsc70 chaperone system.  This project will facilitate                    evaluation of the following concepts: 1) that reversible                        phosphorylation of PDC is a primary control mechanism for carbon                entry into the Krebs cycle; 2) that PDC regulatory mechanisms                   differ during development and between photosynthetic and                        nonphotosynthetic tissues; 3) that the in vitro and in situ                     regulatory mechanisms function in vivo; 4) that import and assembly             of PDC requires chaperones.",
