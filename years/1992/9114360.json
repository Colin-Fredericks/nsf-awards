 "awd_abstract_narration": "A project is to be undertaken to further our understanding of                   linear stochastic wave fields, waves which have suffered                        sufficient randomizing scatterings or reflections as to lose most               coherence.  Such fields are present in applications of                          ultrasonics in many modern materials, and on sufficiently long                  time scales in most finite elastic bodies, in reverberation rooms               for which the application is conventional acoustics, and in                     complex irregular structures for which accurate acoustics and                   vibrational descriptions have long been sought.  The proposed                   project consists of two main thrusts.  Laboratory and analytic                  work will be conducted on ultrasonic fields in strongly                         heterogeneous but statistically homogeneous media, which special                emphasis on applications in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation                and on seeking the effects of residual coherence in such fields                 by demonstration the long-sought phenomenon of classical wave                   Anderson Localization.  A second thrust consisting of large scale               computational work on the responses of model reverberation rooms                will also be conducted, with a view towards better understanding                of eigenmode statistics with consequent potential impact on                     improved statistical models of the structural acoustics of                      complex systems.",
