 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a cultural anthropologist with extensive                  experience in Africa and in the Philippines studying the home-                  town linkages of urban workers in Yoruba society, Nigeria.  In                  contemporary third-world societies, many people are highly mobile               but maintain ties with their home base.  This project studies how               hometown links are operationalized in the context of the 1980's                 economic crisis.  Using ethnographic and survey methods, the                    project will examine individual, family, and organizational links               to the hometown, analyzing gender and socioeconomic differences                 in the reliance on these ties.  Information from Africa will be                 compared with the investigator's similar case study from the                    Philippines.                                                                                                                                                    This study is important because it will provide a corrective to                 the simplistic view of third world migration as \"push\" from                     opportunity-poor rural areas and \"pull\" from opportunity-rich                   urban sites.  The reality is that urban migrants maintain                       important ties with their place of origin. The knowledge from                   this case study will be useful to those concerned with urban                    problems in the third world, as it will illuminate the reasons                  and values behind rural-urban population movements.",
