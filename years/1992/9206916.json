 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although parasites are ubiquitous and play an important role in                 most natural communities, they have generally been overlooked by                population biologist.  The almost complete lack of knowledge of the             genetic structure of natural populations of parasites is                        particularly noteworthy.  Genetic variation among parasites in                  their ability to infect various species of hosts is relevant to                 questions concerning (1) the effects of parasites on species                    diversity within communities, (2) the maintenance of genetic                    variation and sexual reproduction within host species, (3) host-                parasite coevolution, and (4) modes of speciation in parasites.                 Such genetic variation may also be important in the evolution and               ecology of zoonoses (parasites of animals that can infect humans)               and pathogenic fungi that infect agricultural plants.  The research             proposed here focuses on a species of nematode, Howardula                       aoronymphium, that in nature parasitizes mushroom-feeding species               of Drosophila.  Previous studies have indicated that this nematode              can have major effects on individuals, populations, and communities             of flies.  The proposed research includes: (1) a survey of natural              populations of H. aoronymphium for genetic variation in                         infectivity, pathogenicity, and individual growth rate as a                     function of host species; and (2) selection experiments to                      determine how patterns of host availability affect the evolution of             host specialization.",
