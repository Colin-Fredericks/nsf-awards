 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, we propose to further our analysis of the                regulation and cell biology of the tobacco root-specific gene,                  TobRB7.  We have chosen to concentrate our analyses to genes                    expressed specifically in roots.  To date, only seven such genes                have been reported (four of which were reported by us).  Cis-acting             sequences responsible for regulated root-specific expression have               been characterized for only one gene (TobRB7).  We propose to                   combine linker-scanning and internal deletion mutational analysis               with DNA footprinting experiments to identify the precise sequences             responsible for regulating root-specific gene expression.  These                sequences will be used subsequently to identify cDNA clones                     encoding the cognate DNA-binding proteins.  The cell biology of the             TobRB7 gene product (expressed in the immature vascular tissue and              predicted to served as a membrane channel) will be characterized                further.  Immunolocalization experiments have putatively localized              the gene product to the plasma membrane.  Experiments are proposed              to examine the physiology of transgenic plants carrying sequences               designed to disrupt TobRB7 gene product function.  Finally, we                  propose to initiate the analysis of a second root-specific gene                 (TobRD2) using technologies similar to those that have proven                   successful for TobRB7.  In situ hybridization experiments using                 TobRD2 probes demonstrate that this gene is expressed specifically              in the root cortex.  We propose to compare and contrast the                     regulatory circuitry of this gene with that of TobRB7.                          %%%                                                                             Despite the importance of roots in plant growth and development,                relatively few genes expressed specifically in roots have been                  isolated.  The results of this study should significantly improve               that situation.",
