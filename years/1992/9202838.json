 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reasoning algorithms are used in many application areas of                      computer science and artificial intelligence.  High                             performance of reasoning algorithms is indispensable to the                     successes of these applications, because of the high                            complexity of real problems.  A software system called RRL,                     the Rewrite Rule Laboratory, developed over the past years                      with the NSF support has been successfully used for solving                     many problems often considered a challenge for automated                        theorem provers.                                                                                                                                                This project will further increase the reasoning power of RRL.                  The objectives of this research will be to develop new high                     performance reasoning algorithms, and to apply these                            algorithms in specification and verification of hardware and                    software.  The research will focus on redundance control of                     automated deduction and mathematical induction.  The topics                     include restricted inference rules, powerful simplication                       rules, unnecessary computation detection, induction schemata                    formulation, induction hypotheses handling, and efficient                       implemenations of all the involved algorithms.  Practical                       verification problems will be chosen from software and hardware                 design as test problems for RRL and RRL will be enhanced to                     meet the need of large-scale applications by providing                          failure-resistant and user-friendly interfaces.  Special                        effort will be made on distributing RRL worldwide to the                        people interested in automated reasoning.",
