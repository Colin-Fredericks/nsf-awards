 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year project designed to enhance the                            physical science instruction in all of the Pueblo, Colorado                     city schools, grades K-5, and to achieve a condition of                         equity which allows full educational opportunity for every                      child regardless of factors which have limited science                          achievement in the past.  The Pueblo Public School District                     No. 60 is among the highest ten in the nation in the                            enrollment of Hispanic children.  Seventy-two Leader                            Teachers will participate (1) during the summer in a 1-week                     Equity Institute followed by a 3-week Physical Science                          Institute, (2) during the academic year in monthly half-day                     workshops to prepare for classroom use of kit materials,                        (3) during the following summer in a one-day workshop with                      their principals to plan for the science inservice of all                       the teachers in their schools, and (4) during the second                        year of participation, in the implementation of their                           school's science inservice plan.                                                                                                                                This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it is a district-wide project designed to                       enhance in a substantive way the science teaching of Leader                     Teachers in all district schools, and because it                                effectively addresses equity issues in the teaching of                          science to children.  The equity component is modeled on                        the successful, NSF-funded SEER project which was conducted                     in St. Louis, Missouri.                                                                                                                                         Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 21% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
