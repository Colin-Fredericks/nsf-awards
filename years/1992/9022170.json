 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the physics of the return                stroke in natural lightning.  Much of the experimental work would               be performed in Florida as part of future coordinated studies of                rocket-triggered lightning.                                                                                                                                          Correlated, two-station measurements of electric fields are                planned and would be used to better characterize the lightning                  near-field environment, and to test the transmission-line model                 and other return stroke models.  Return stroke velocity, a key                  parameter in return stroke modeling, would be measured                          photelectrically, and fast time- and height-resolved measurements               of narrow-band lightning emissions near the base of the channel                 would be used to investigate recent hypotheses concerning the                   mechanism of return stroke initiation.                                                                                                                               Radiometric observations of lightning emissions in the near-               IR and visible would be used as a means of remotely determining                 lightning channel temperatures.  Together with simultaneous                     measurements of current, these data would provide a unique                      opportunity for testing numerical models of slow time-varying                   arcs in air.",
