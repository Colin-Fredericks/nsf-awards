 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objectives of this research are to describe the                small sample problems associated with several of the most                       frequently used time-series statistical procedures and to develop               improved alternative methods.  The plan is to provide researchers               and applied statisticians with information regarding the negative               consequences of employing conventional time-series methods with                 small sample sizes and to provide more satisfactory procedures for              the small sample case.  More specifically,  the nature and                      magnitude of small sample bias will be evaluated in a wide variety              of descriptive and inferential statistics used in the analysis of               simple and complex intervention and non-intervention time-series                studies.                                                                             The investigation will require computer simulations of the                 sampling distributions of various autoregressive and white noise                processes.  The focus will be on simple univariate autoregressive               models because such models appear to characterize a large                       proportion of applications in the social sciences.  The early                   stages of the work are expected to specify clearly the weaknesses               of several conventional methods.  It is anticipated that new                    procedures developed in the last stage of the research will lead                to improved statistical and substantive conclusions in many areas               of science that now employ time-series methods.                                      The principal investigators are well qualified to carry out                this project.  They are expert in both time-series analysis and                 robustness and they have many years of experience in their                      respective fields.",
