 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humboldt State University seeks funds to develop and implement                  a program which will reach mathematics faculty members who                      teach courses for preservice K-8 teachers.  The goal of the                     project is to transform the way preservice mathematics courses                  are taught so that mathematics faculty will model the teaching                  techniques which prospective K-8 teachers will be expected to                   exhibit in their own classrooms.  To achieve this goal,                         intensive summer workshops are planned for 300 California                       college faculty who will teach over 9,000 students per year,                    and other programs which will reach an additional 600 faculty                   members.  These workshops and inservice activities focus on:                    selection and dissemination of integrated instructional units,                  increased use of effective instructional styles, increased                      participation in mathematics education reform, improved                         networking and discussion among mathematics faculty, and                        improved preparation of K-8 teachers who will experience                        learning mathematics from instructors who model exemplary                       practices for the new teachers to emulate.  University level                    materials will be developed for the mathematics courses which                   take into consideration the NCTM Standards documents, the MAA                   Call for Change and the California Framework as well as other                   curriculum and content mathematics project for the precollege                   and collegiate levels.  Two year college faculty will                           participate in the program.                                                                                                                                     Cost sharing is approximately 12% of NSF funding.",
