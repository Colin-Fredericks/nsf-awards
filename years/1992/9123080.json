 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of hybridization in the formation of new species,                 particularly at the diploid level, is a central problem of plant                evolution. Graduate student Andrea Wolfe, under the direction of                faculty advisor Wayne Elisens at University of Oklahoma, proposes               to test various hypotheses of homoploid hybrid speciation in a                  complex of four species of herbaceous perennials in the genus                   Penstemon, using molecular and genetic markers. Individual plants               sampled throughout the range of each species will be surveyed for               isozyme (protein) variation and for mutational differences in                   chloroplast DNA and in nuclear ribosomal DNA. Because these data                provide genetic markers which minimize problems of character                    intermediacy and dominance, they are especially appropriate for                 testing hypotheses about hybridization and introgression, and the               origin of new species from stabilized hybrid recombinants. The                  study represents a unique opportunity to test two examples of                   hybrid speciation in a group of closely related plants. Because                 one purported parental species, Penstemon centranthifolius, has                 numerous diagnostic molecular and genetic markers which distinguish             it from other members of this hybrid complex, the group of species              also offers an excellent system to test models of introgressive                 hybridization, the \"leakage\" of genes from one species into                     another.",
