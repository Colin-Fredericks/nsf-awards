 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic Structure of Condensed Matter - The proposed research is             aimed at the development of computational methods for studying                  electronic states in condensed matter and the use of those methods              to study the electronic properties of solids and liquids.  The                  primary techniques to be used are quantum Monte Carlo and density-              functional theory.  Two primary improvements for QMC are                        contemplated: finding accurate and efficient representations for                the many-electron wave function and development of pseudopotentials             suitable for elimination of the effects of core electrons.  Such                improved QMC techniques can be used to provide an improved                      exchange-correlation energy for DFT which would include the effects             of structural inhomogeneity.  These improved DFT methods can then               be directly compared to the QMC results for tests of accuracy.                  When the new DFT methods are tested, they can be used to generate               trial functions to make QMC analysis more efficient.  This coupling             between different computational approaches is seen as central to                the proposed research.  The potential benefit of using massively-               parallel computers on this class of problems will also be                       investigated.  Concurrent with their development, these techniques              will be applied to the study of a wide range of condensed systems,              ranging from jellium to highly correlated materials                             %%%                                                                             The proposed research is part of a long-term effort to understand               and to predict the properties of real-world materials.  They                    propose to develop complementary computational methods for                      determining the electronic structure (and hence the physical                    properties) of a wide range of solids and liquids.  The emphasis is             to refine and simplify existing techniques, so that the resulting               methods are practical for use on complex materials.  This research              will include development and evaluation of algorithms for massively             parallel computers.  As improved computational techniques are                   developed, they will be applied to problems with direct connections             to experimental physics and materials science - both to test the                methods and to understand and predict experimentally relevant                   properties.  Such materials as silicon, condensed states of                     hydrogen metal surfaces, and liquid and amorphous systems will be               studied.",
