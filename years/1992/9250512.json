 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students at Pitzer, a liberal arts college, are studying                        mathematics presented in a manner that relates to real-world                    situations that interest them. Three non-traditional                            mathematics courses are being designed to be attractive to                      students who may have limited previous exposure to college-                     level mathematics.  Major portions of these courses involve                     students interacting with computer workstations which are                       allowing them to directly control the elements of mathematical                  phenomena and immediately visualize the result.  Through these                  interactions, students are gaining an understanding of                          mathematics and how it relates to the world around them.  The                   computer hardware and software are providing a learning                         laboratory at a college where mathematical studies are often                    something many students have learned to avoid and where                         computers are frequently only associated with word processing.                  The immediate goal is to revitalize the relationship students                   feel with mathematical studies.  The ultimate goal is to alter                  some of the misconceptions that may exist about what is an                      appropriate mathematical education for liberal arts college                     students.",
