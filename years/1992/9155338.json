 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community School District 6 in New York has a total                             enrollment of 23,000 students in grades kindergarten through                    8th grade.  This district extends across Manhattan from                         135th St. to 220th St., and has an 85% Hispanic student                         population, of which 40% have limited English abilities.                        Almost 95% of the students qualify for the free lunch                           program.  Mr. Robert Werner, Science Coordinator of the                         district, has proposed a comprehensive five-year plan for                       training the district's teachers in a recently adopted hands                    on inquiry-based science curriculum for the elementary                          grades.  One lead teacher per grade per school has already                      received some training by district science coordinators.                        This project would greatly accelerate and expand the                            training effort, and would establish a leadership team in                       each school composed of three lead teachers, the Principal,                     and the Science Assistant Principal.  The Workshop Center of                    CCNY and EDC would provide training for the lead teachers,                      principals, and assistant principals.  The lead teachers                        would be released from their classrooms for three periods                       per week, in order to provide training to the other teachers                    in their school.                                                                                                                                                The proposed teacher enhancement project will have                              significant impact on a school district with enormous need.                     A total of 180 teachers will receive training directly in                       workshop settings, and the remaining 600 will have frequent                     in-class coaching and mentoring by their lead teacher                           colleagues.  The plan to provide training to school                             administrators will assure a long-term change in the                            attitudes of school officials toward science instruction.                       The school district has demonstrated its commitment to                          exemplary science education in the past, and has made firm                      commitments for future contributions.                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the school district represents 124% of the                      NSF contribution.",
