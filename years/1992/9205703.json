 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to recover a detailed                 record of Laurentide Ice Sheet fluctuations in southern Ohio during             the last glacial cycle to test climate-change hypotheses.  Multiple             (~150) radiocarbon ages from organic materials associated with                  glacial deposits of the Miami and Scioto sublobes will delineate                a high-resolution chronology (e.g. glacial phases dated to within               30014C years) and architecture of these ice marginal changes                    through the last glacial maximum.  This record by itself will                   clarify the behavior of southern sector of the huge Laurentide Ice              Sheet (a key component of the ice-age climate system).  It may also             be an important repository of climatic change.  If so, this basic               stratigraphic record will be the basis for tests between at least               two current hypotheses of ice-age climate.  The first suggest that              orbital changes drive ice sheets which in turn drive climate, thus              predicting specific leads and lags between ice sheet growth and                 climate change.  The second view suggests that ice-age climate                  changes result from abrupt ocean-atmospheric reorganizations, thus              predicting widespread, synchronous changes across the global                    cryosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere system.  For example, the second              hypothesis requires that glacial fluctuations in various parts of               the Northern Hemisphere will be in phase and that these in turn,                will be concurrent with glacial fluctuations in the Southern                    Hemisphere.  Present stratigraphic interpretations of southern                  Laurentide fluctuations in Ohio are inadequate to delineate ice-                sheet dynamics or test any climate theories because they have not               fully considered the genesis of glacial deposits and have only weak             (+2,00014C years) chronologic control.",
