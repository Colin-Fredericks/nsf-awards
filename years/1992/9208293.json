 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to produce efficient and                      effective FPGA partitioning and placement tools that are capable                of simultaneously meeting a number of objectives subject to several             design requirements in order to achieve optimal system performance.             Dr. Saab has developed two algorithmic methodologies for the                    solution of large-scale combinatorial problems with several                     constraints.  These two general techniques are:  Stochastic                     Evolution which is a probabilistic algorithm, and the Limited                   Exhaustive Search Strategy which is a strict descent iterative                  algorithm.  Initial experimentation with these two techniques is                quite encouraging and optimal solutions are achieved in certain                 applications.  The goal is to use these two general optimization                techniques to obtain effective and efficient FPGA partitioning and              placement tools.  This research will also investigate other                     approaches for partitioning and placement such as genetic                       algorithms, neural nets, and tabu search, and can potentially                   stimulate the use of Stochastic Evolution and the Limited                       Exhaustive Search Strategy for the solutions of many large and                  difficult engineering problems.  FPGA design tools are immediate                consequences of this effort.",
