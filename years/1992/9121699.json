 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Professor James Reilly of Indiana                           University will use high resolution overtone spectroscopy to                    study highly vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules seeded                  in supersonic expansions.  He will search for high resolution                   structure indicative of weak vibrational mode couplings in                      selected compounds as well as look at molecules with broad,                     structureless room temperature spectra.  The goal is to begin                   to understand vibrational mode mixing and dynamics in highly                    excited molecules.                                                              %%%                                                                             When excess energy is deposited into vibrational modes of                       polyatomic molecules, that is, those molecules composed of                      several atoms, that energy can dissipate internally by                          redistributing among the other vibrations in the molecule, or                   it may be given up to other atoms or molecules with which the                   excited molecule collides.  This project aims at studying the                   ways in which such excess vibrational energy flows out of the                   initially excited parts of a molecule.  Such information is                     important to scientists interested in understanding how the                     excess energy released in chemical reactions can affect the                     course of these reactions.",
