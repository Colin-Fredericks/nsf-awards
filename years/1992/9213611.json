 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accompanying the increasing integration of global production               and trade connections has been the rise of new industrial                       districts.  These are spatially distinct areas of economic                      activity dominated by a specialized set of trade-oriented                       industries which induce in turn population and employment growth.               The literature on new industrial districts focuses on                           agglomeration forces and externalities, the networks and                        relationships among firms, and the functioning of local labor                   markets.   Because of the wide variety of forms such industrial                 districts take on, and because disagreement exists over which                   districts to designate as new and specialized, this research will               amplify and generalize the theory of their formation and                        location.  The theoretical portion of the study will concentrate                on non-place embeddedness, non-local externalities, interdistrict               labor mobility, and the role of the State in new industrial                     district formation.  The empirical portion will examine districts               in four countries:  the United States, Japan, Korea, and Brazil.                A typology of industrial districts will be developed, and                       specific hypotheses will be tested which reflect the                            theoretically expected attributes attributed to each district                   type.  Data for the analysis will come from published statistics                available in each country.  An international team of researchers                will work on case study districts in each country, and they will                compare and contrast their findings across national contexts.                        This research will produce a fuller basic theory of new                    industrial district formation based on a broader analysis of                    embeddedness, externalities, and developmental agents.  It will                 result in a typology of new industrial districts which is more                  comprehensive and adaptable to various national situations.  The                four nation comparison of new industrial districts will permit an               interpretation of how national differences in political                         structure, stage of development, economic strategy, and corporate               structure, condition their growth and formation.",
