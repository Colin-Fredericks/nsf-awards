 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the improvement and computerization of the            mycological holdings in the Charles Peck collection at the New York             State Mycological Herbarium, and is aimed at ensuring  preservation             of and greater accessibility to the collection for research and                 teaching.  This project is an outgrowth of recommendations made by              an advisory panel that examined and evaluated the collections in                1991.  A complementary project funded by NEH would support the                  preservation and indexing of the archival materials associated with             the collection.  Specific tasks of the NSF-supported project include            the preparation of a database and catalogue of the type specimens               with cross-references to archival correspondence and water color                illustrations; the latter have never been loaned or published,                  and slides of these watercolors will be prepared for dissemination              to the mycological research community.  Curatorial improvements                 involve new housing materials and the preservation of  specimen                 labels.  The collection of 84,000 fungi is completely documented,               contains about 3500 types and 2734 holotypes, and because of Peck's             dominant role in American mycology, is of international import and              central to mycological taxonomy.  The improvements allowed by this              award will enhance the value and use of this collection in                      biological research and teaching.",
