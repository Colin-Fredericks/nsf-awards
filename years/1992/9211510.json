 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discipline of timing management is the key to the effective                 design of any large scale computer systems in this era of advanced              technology.  It has been pointed out by Sutherland recently that                the current design framework which employs a globally clocked                   timing discipline has reached its limit.  It was demonstrated that              there are many advantages if a different timing discipline, namely,             the transition-signal conceptual framework is used to design                    complex computation systems.                                                                                                                                    In this research, we take a bottom up approach to accomplish the                synthesis of micropipeline processing systems from a high-level                 specification.  The first milestone is to examine the design and                building of micropipeline structures using differential CMOS logic              instead of static CMOS logic.  The second milestone is to implement             an automatic synthesis system for a particular micropipeline                    stage's logic processing block given a set of logic equations.  The             third milestone is to implement all necessary token control                     circuitry.  The last milestone is to map a dataflow graph which                 specifies a particular algorithm into hardware using the                        micropipeline design frame work.",
