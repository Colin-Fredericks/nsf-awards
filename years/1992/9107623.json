 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                       under the Hungary Joint Fund between Dr. Sandor Szalay,                         Eotvos University, and Dr. David C. Koo, Lick Observatory,                      is to make major advances in the understanding of the                           structure of the universe.                                                                                                                                      Current observations of the large scale structure of the                        universe show inhomogeneities on much larger scales than                        previously thought.  Deep redshift surveys of galaxies                          with 'pencilbeam' geometry towards the North and South                          Galactic Poles indicate strong clustering along the line                        of sight, on scales exceeding 100 Mpc, with a provocative                       regularity.  The existence and the distribution of such                         superclusters have profound implications for cosmology,                         but these observations will only gain a general acceptance                      after overwhelming evidence has been presented.  These                          researchers will carry out new observations to:  extract                        more information from the existing unique data, establish                       the statistical errors in more detail, study the effect of                      the projections, the transverse extent of the structures,                       and search for signs of gravitational infall.                                                                                                                   This project in cosmology fulfills the program objective                        of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                           experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                      of strong mutual interest and competence.",
