 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the acquisition of a Siemens X-Ray                        Diffractometer system and associated equipment to complete the                  development of a state-of-the-art facility in x-ray diffraction                 and electron optical methods which are non-destructive                          techniques commonly used in the characterization of structure,                  physical state, stress, and texture of materials.  This project                 will significantly enhance the materials analysis capabilities                  of the undergraduate laboratory.  Experiments have been                         developed which highlight basic principles such as phase                        diagram determination of alloys, phase characterization of                      superconducting oxides, texture development, and analysis of                    cold worked and annealed metals, phase analysis of corroded                     materials and corrosion by-products, amorphous materials,                       polymers and composites, and laser melted metals.  The                          equipment will be used by a total of 1,465 students per year.                   The laboratory will be the only such facility in the entire                     campus and will also serve as a regional center for faculty and                 students from smaller colleges and junior colleges.",
