 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although gonadal hormones act on the brain to influence a variety               of processes, it is unclear exactly how these hormones act on the               brain to produce their effects.  Recently, induction of the                     proto-oncogene c-fos has been used as a tool to identify individual             neurons and areas of the brain which are activated by particular                physiological stimuli.  The present project proposes to adapt the               technique of c-fos immunocytochemistry to examine which nuclei in               the brain are activated during exposure to the ovarian hormones                 estrogen and progesterone and during sexual behavior in the female              guinea pig.  In addition, the techniques to double label cells for              c-fos and a variety of neuropeptides will be developed so that it               can be ascertained whether particular neuropeptides are contained               in the cells which are activated by ovarian hormones and sexual                 behavior.  This will give us further insights into exactly how and              where these gonadal hormones may be exerting their effects and will             provide the preliminary data to form the basis of a grant proposal              which will examine whether the noradrenergic system and ovarian                 hormones interact at a particular subset of neurons to exert their              facilitatory actions on female lordosis behavior.",
