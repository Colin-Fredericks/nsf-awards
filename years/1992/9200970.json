 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort will seek a resolution to the controversy on DOM                    measurements that have arisen due to the development of a high                  temperature combustion method.  Apparent differences may be due to              variable blank interferences and varying approaches to correction.              It appears that rigorous protocol, not only for sample collection               and preparation, but also for standardization and blank correction,             could bring disparate DOC values closer together.  It remains to be             seen whether the older wet chemical and UV methods really miss much             of the \"new\" DOC.  The HTC methods for DON are obviously less well              developed, but there is hope that with attention to monitoring of               nitrogen budgets in method development a more complete final                    product can be obtained that does give all of the DON.  There is                presently no clear indication that conventional methods for DON                 give values much lower than HTC ones, but there are serious                     problems still to be resolved with the HTC methods.  The proposed               next step is an effort that will take approximately two years and               is based on recommendations arising from a community wide workshop              convened to address the issue.",
