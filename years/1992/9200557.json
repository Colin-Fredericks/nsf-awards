Among the topics to be encompassed by this project are: (1) two-                dimensional gravity and cohomology of moduli spaces, and their                  relations with matrix models, topological field theories and                    \"dessins;\" (2) mirror symmetry and its consequences in string                   theory and algebraic geometry; (3) two-dimensional string theory                and non-compact sigma models; (4) solvable gauge theories and their             applications in mathematics; and (5) elliptic cohomology and its                generalizations.                                                                     This project will support the Conference on Geometry and                   Quantum Field Theory to be held from March 26-29, 1992 at Johns                 Hopkins University.  A pre- and post-conference workshop will also              be held.  The conference activity will be held in conjunction with              a special year on these topics, hosted by the Japan-U.S. Institute              at Johns Hopkins.  The major topics to be covered by the conference             include two-dimensional gravity, mirror symmetry, two-dimensional               string theory, solvable gauge theories, and elliptic cohomology.",
