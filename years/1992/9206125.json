 "awd_abstract_narration": "During late oogenesis in Drosophila, ovarian follicle cells                     synthesize and secrete several proteins that assemble to form the               vitelline membrane and chorion sublayers that comprise the                      eggshell. Dr. Waring's research is directed towards understanding               the molecular mechanisms that underlie eggshell formation. She                  proposes to continue her studies on the dec-1 gene, an eggshell                 gene that is exceptional in terms of its size, mutability,                      production of alternatively spliced transcripts, and post-                      translational protein modifications. In addition, she will expand               her studies to include other eggshell genes so that she can begin               to establish functional interrelationships among the eggshell                   proteins. Studies are proposed in three areas. First, antibodies                that have been raised against different regions of the dec-1 gene               will be used to study proteolytic processing of the three dec-1                 primary translation products and their derivatives. Second,                     product specific antibodies will be used to localize different                  eggshell proteins in assembling and mature eggshells. By                        comparing the distribution of different eggshell proteins in wild               type and mutant eggshells, she hopes to gain insight into                       protein-protein interactions that are important in eggshell                     assembly. Third, by structural and functional comparisons of the                dec-1 gene in evolutionarily distant species, she hopes to                      identify molecular features of the dec-1 gene that are essential                for its function. Macromolecular assembly has been extensively                  studied in viruses and bacteriophage due to the ready                           availability of mutations that disrupt their assembly. The                      eggshell in Drosophila provides an opportunity to study a                       macromolecular assembly process in a genetically amenable                       eukaryotic organism.",
