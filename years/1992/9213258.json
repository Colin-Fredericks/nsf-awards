 "awd_abstract_narration": "To date, many analyses of national policies treat those                    policies as evolving out of the distinctive needs, conflicts, and               histories of national societies.  Over the past two decades,                    sociological theorists have moved towards an emphasis on the                    economic interdependency of states and the functioning of states                as part of a world system.  In this context, diffusion processes,               that is, the transmission of policies across social actors, can                 be  seen as central to the way national policy making is                        constrained and informed by a larger social, political, and                     cultural environment.  This proposal will use event-history                     analyses of national policies in environmental protection to                    investigate the world-wide adoption of national policies.  These                models will permit the estimation of effects related to the                     susceptibility of the potential adopter to external influences,                 the infectiousness of external sources of diffusion, and the                    social proximity of the potential adopter to the source of                      diffusion.                                                                                                                                                           This project will contribute to our understanding of the                   timing of the adoption of national policies based on                            understandings of (1) the ways that relationships among nation-                 states as well as internal forces speed or retard diffusion of                  policies, (2) the ways that international organizations help                    produce similar policies, and (3) the ways that the timing and                  characteristics of policies affect the rates of diffusion.  This                project will make an important social scientific contribution to                our understanding of the human dimensions of global environmental               change, and it should provide us with new insights into the                     potential uses and limitations of event-history analyses.",
