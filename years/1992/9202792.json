The expected results of such a                system include: increased transport throughput because vehicles can             operate faster and globally efficient paths can be planned;                     improved safety due to increased collision detection and avoidance              capabilities; and reduced vehicle costs.                                             In order to demonstrate that global vision is technically                  feasible for vehicle control and is cost-effective as compared to               other feasible means of control, the following tasks will be                    performed: (1) camera placement, where algorithms will be developed             to determine a minimal number of cameras and their positions in a               facility; (2) object tracking, where difference image-based methods             will be developed to detect and track moving objects; (3)                       performance measurement, where actual hardware and software                     implementations will be used to demonstrate the technical                       feasibility of global vision for a typical factory shop floor; and              (4) economic feasibility, where analysis techniques will be                     developed to compare different methods of controlling free-ranging              transport vehicles.",
