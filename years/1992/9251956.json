 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the Kirkwood Community College                        physics curriculum by emphasizing laboratory experiences that                   unify content and methodology.  Specifically:  1) laboratory                    experiences emphasize the time variable as a unifying concept;                  2) laboratory and lecture topics are being more closely linked;                 3) students are using only a few data gathering instruments and                 data analysis methods for many experiments throughout the                       course; and 4) physics data analysis software is the same as                    that being used in mathematics and engineering courses.This                     improvement in physics laboratories is being accomplished with                  the purchase of three IBM computers with velocity, temperature,                 force transducers, and real-time interfaces.This project is                     significant because it provides conceptual unity, unity in                      laboratory instrumentation and unity in data analysis                           techniques.  The instrumentation is facilitating data gathering                 and analysis so students are able to concentrate on                             experimental design, problem-solving and understanding                          concepts.",
