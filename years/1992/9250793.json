 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object-oriented paradigm (OOP) is having a significant                      effect on software development and use.  Through this project,                  Lawrence University will integrate OOP into a core of four                      introductory and intermediate computer science offerings taken                  by the math/computer science majors and other students who                      choose to supplement their major with a strong background in                    computer science.  A key to this integration is switching from                  Pascal to C++ as the programming language used in these                         courses.  By providing students early exposure to object-                       oriented programming, instructing them how to make the most                     effective use of programming tools, exposing them to issues in                  abstraction and portability, and teaching them how to use                       already developed code libraries, the project will insure that                  the students' growth in computer science is in step with the                    most recent trends in the discipline.  To assist in achieving                   these goals, through this project the institution will acquire                  workstations which support a rich C++ environment for                           developing and using class libraries.",
