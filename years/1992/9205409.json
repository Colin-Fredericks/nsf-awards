 "awd_abstract_narration": "Migration theory emphasizes the various ways in which social               networks based on family, kin, and ethnic ties are established by               expatriate communities in response to new political, economic,                  and social circumstances.  Missing from this genre of research is               insight into how gender interacts with ethnicity and class in the               process of migration and settlement.  Much research has                         overlooked the importance of international migrations within the                Third World, focusing instead on labor migration from                           economically less well developed to more developed countries.                   This research project will examine the abrupt and large                         population movement of Indians in Tanzania in the period 1960-                  1990 as a means of understanding the complex processes of large                 scale migration within the Third World.  The study will highlight               how groups of migrants were affected by and responded to                        geographical differences in social, economic, and political                     conditions associated with migration.  Data from archives in both               India and Tanzania will be combined with personal interviews and                participant observation of migrants to test hypotheses relating                 gender, class, caste, age, and family structure to particular                   migration streams to and within Tanzania.                                            Within the past century, and particularly since the breakup                of colonial empires, there have been substantial migrations of                  people into Africa.  One of the most dynamic situations has                     involved the migration of Asian Indians into and with the country               of Tanzania.  This project will not only provide documentation of               this phenomenon, but it will also explain how such disruptions                  help to redefine ethnic boundaries, gender relations, and class                 hierarchies under changing political and economic conditions.",
