 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to continue                           paleontological exploration of cave deposits in the Otavi Mountains             of northern Namibia.  During the past year Conroy and colleagues                discovered in this area the first Miocene hominoid known from                   southern Africa.  The fossil has been named Otavipithecus and it                exhibits a number of features which differentiate it from other                 middle Miocene hominoids from Eurasia and other areas of Africa.                Dating by association places Otavipithecus between 12 and 14 MYA.               A number of other deposits have been identified in the Otavi region             which require systematic exploration.  The discovery of three                   separate fossil faunas at the Otavi site of Berg Aukas (both                    Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene) will allow the investigators to track             faunal and, by inference, paleoecological changes through rime in               this part of Africa.                                                                                                                                            The discovery of Otavipithecus significantly extends the range of               hominoids in this time period.  As a result hypotheses which view               East Africa and/or Eurasia as the foci for hominoid evolution may               need to be re-evaluated.  Indications are that Miocene Namibia was              relatively humid in contrast to the semi-arid conditions of                     Oligocene and modern Namibia.  The Otavi deposits have great                    potential for providing information on vertebrate evolution and                 paleoclimate and ecological change in Southern Africa over a span               of 16 million years.",
