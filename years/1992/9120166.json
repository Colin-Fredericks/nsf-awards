 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory of Magnetic Materials - The goal of this project is to                   investigate the energy levels, wave functions, and derived                      properties of electrons in solids from two points of view. Density              functional theory is the basis for most current calculations of the             electronic structure of solids from a single-particle point of                  view.  Development of improved computational techniques is                      proposed, which are then to be applied to a range of systems of                 special interest, including transition metals and high-Tc                       superconductors.  The alternate viewpoint concerns systems in which             the electron-electron interaction is strong, so that the single-                electron picture is inadequate for description of the electronic                behavior.  This project proposes to find and interpret exact                    solutions of the many-body problem on finite clusters, and                      subsequently generalize these result to larger systems.                         %%%                                                                             The electronic structure of solids determines virtually all of                  their physical properties.  This proposal seeks to extend our                   ability to calculate and describe this structure in two ways.  The              most commonly used technique for determining electronic structure               will be improved to allow their application to systems which are                currently intractable.  Secondly, a class of materials which are                very resistent to any conventional description (called \"strongly                correlated\") will be treated by finding the structure of very;                  small clusters of these very difficult materials, and using these               cluster results as a basis for determining the properties of the                corresponding bulk materials.",
