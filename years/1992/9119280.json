 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animal and plant species contain bacteria, called                     endosymbionts, that inhabit specialized cells of their hosts.                   These associations are widespread in insects that feed on plant                 sap, including aphids and their evolutionary relatives.  The                    insects cannot grow or reproduce without their endosymbionts, and               specialized mechanisms ensure that offspring are infected at                    birth.                                                                               Dr. Nancy Moran of the University of Arizona, collaborating                with Dr. Paul Baumann at the University of California-Davis, is                 working to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the                          endosymbioses of aphids and related insects, in order to                        determine how the bacteria and insects have diversified in                      association with one another.  They are analyzing nucleotide                    sequence data from ribosomal DNA from both bacteria and their                   hosts in order to infer phylogenetic trees of the species, by                   measuring mutational differences among the taxa.  Analysis of the               correspondence, or lack thereof, of these phylogenetic trees will               permit a determination of whether the bacteria have diversified                 in parallel with hosts or whether unrelated groups of bacteria                  have frequently invaded new insect hosts through time.  The data                will also allow an estimate of the ages of the associations and                 of rates of molecular change.  The findings should illuminate the               nature of endosymbiotic associations in general and will aid in                 understanding the evolution of this important group of insects.",
