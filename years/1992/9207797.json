 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Complexity is a modern discipline which analyzes                  the inherent difficulty of a given task.  A great deal of                       progress has been made in classifying the time and space                        requirements of certain combinatorial problems.  The                            complexity classes L, NL, P, NP-logarithmic space,                              nondeterministic logarithmic space, polynomial time,                            nondeterministic polynomial time, respectively-have been                        studied extensively.  Nonetheless little is known about the                     comparative strengths of different resources-it is yet to be                    proved that the above classes are not all identical.                                                                                                            These classes will be studied from a mathematical viewpoint,                    and have examined the inherent difficulties of expressing                       conditions and shown that a robust alternate view of                            complexity ensues.  The computational complexity of a property                  is closely tied to the complexity of expressing the property                    in first-order logic, and a series of languages have been                       introduced which express exactly those properties checkable in                  a series of computational complexity classes.  The existence                    of such natural languages for each important complexity class                   sheds a new light on complexity theory.  These languages                        reaffirm the importance of the complexity classes as much more                  than machine dependent issues.                                                                                                                                  The research will concentrate on the following specific                         proposals:  (1) Order-Independent Languages, (2) First-Order                    Interpretations, (3) Applications to Databases and Incremental                  Complexity, and (4) Tradeoffs in Descriptive Complexity.",
