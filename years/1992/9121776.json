 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classical statistical and econometric methods underpin almost all               empirical and some theoretical research in economics.  But these                methods are subject to restrictive assumptions that often do not                hold in real-world economic problems.  Applied estimates using                  classical statistical tools are sometimes very sensitive to small               changes in the assumptions about underlying economic                            relationships or to a few \"outlier\" observations.  Robust                       inference is a very active field of research in statistics and                  econometrics that provides tools for applied economic research                  that do not easily breakdown because they are relatively                        insensitive to outlier observations or changes in assumptions.                  The contribution of this project comes in three areas of robust                 inference: (1) conditional quantile methods for parametric linear               models, (2) nonparametric estimation of conditional quantile                    functions, and (3) global versus local measures of robustness for               statistical procedures.                                                                                                                                         This project extends work on regression rank-scores to a broad                  range of new estimation and testing problems.  Regression rank-                 scores defined from the dual solution to the regression quantile                problem provide a natural foundation for rank based methods of                  estimation and inference for the linear model.  Applications to                 testing for heteroscedasticity and to time-series models are                    proposed.  A new method for forming confidence and prediction                   intervals for quantile regression is introduced, and                            investigation of its efficacy is proposed.  Efficient computer                  algorithms for application of regression quantile and regression                rank-score methods are developed.                                                                                                                               Several approaches to nonparametric estimation of conditional                   quantile functions are studied.  Computation is carried out                     within the linear programming framework of ordinary regression                  quantiles; moreover the solution for various bandwidths can be                  formulated as a parametric linear programming problem and is thus               amenable to efficient solution.  Other approaches may be based on               weighted regression quantile estimates and provide a general                    kernel-based approach.  Substantial theoretical, methodological,                and applied work concerning these approaches is carried out.                                                                                                    Further investigation of estimation and test breakdown is                       proposed.  The project develops versions of regression rank-score               tests with improved breakdown properties.  The research                         investigates the general concept of breakdown, its relationship                 with the tail behavior of estimation procedures, and general                    methods of combining high efficiency with high breakdown                        robustness.",
