 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improvements in a psychoacoustics laboratory at Lawrence                        University will provide, for non-science majors interested in                   music and languages, hands-on experience with an enhanced,                      real-time analysis of acoustic signals.  A sound spectrograph                   and support instruments will allow development of a laboratory                  component in Psycholinguistics and Psychology of Music.  The                    real-time sound spectrograph will provide immediate analysis                    and display of speech and musical stimuli.  Additional                          instruments, microcomputers, and software will record and                       correlate physiological measures, such as vocal cord action and                 airflow, with the acoustical measures.  This equipment will                     permit students to demonstrate and test experimentally the                      effect of articulatory and respiratory changes, emotional                       state, and acoustic information on the perception of music and                  speech.  The goal of this improvement is to engage non-science                  majors in the scientific study of speech and music by the                       presentation of compelling, immediately accessible                              demonstrations and augmented interactive laboratory                             experiences.  Students working on independent projects in the                   psychophysics of music and speech will also use the equipment.",
