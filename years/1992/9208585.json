This project will develop process algebra-based techniques and           software tools for reasoning about probabilistic and real-time aspects          of concurrent systems.                                                                                                                                                    o  Testing Preorders for Probabilistic Processes -                                 Testing preorders for probabilistic processes based on                          the natural notion of a process passing a test with a                           certain probability will be extended , and                                                                                                                   o  Axiomatizing Probabilistic Processes - An extension of                          the process algebra ACP to the probabilistic setting                            constitutes a complete axiomatization of probabilistic                          bisimulation for finite process.  Work will continue by                         considering recursion in the language, a weak version of                        probabilistic bisimulation in which internal actions are                        abstracted away, and the stratified model of                                    probabilistic processes.                                                                                                                                     o  Integrated Models of Probabilistic and Real-Time                                Processes - The research will follow a dual approach to                         developing techniques for analyzing probabilistic and                           real-time systems by introducing time, in an integrated                         manner, into probabilistic testing preorders and into                           probabilistic extension of ACP.                                                                                                                         A major outgrowth will be a suite of design tools for analyzing            algebraically the reliability and performance of systems.  One can use          this design environment to apply the methodology to substantive                 realistic examples, such as communication protocols and distributed             resource allocation algorithms.",
