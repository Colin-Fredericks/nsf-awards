 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although historically distinct, algebraic topology, group                  theory, and representation theory have increasingly interacted.                 Algebraic K-theory and work on classifying spaces of finite groups              are good examples of this.  Professor Kuhn has long been interested             in such overlaps, most recently in his work relating Steenrod                   algebra technology to group representation theory.  Here he will                study various topics in this spirit.  One project consists of using             his representation theoretic tools to study some very classical                 types of topological realization questions.  Another consists of                using these same tools to study state-of-the-art questions in                   algebraic K-theory.  A third involves applying algebraic K-                     theoretic methods to the group ring isomorphism problem.                             The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject for                     calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools               used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.  Algebraic K-theory has been developed into a major                tool for this purpose, and the interplay between the algebra and                the topology involved remains a fascinating subject.",
