 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports work on motives and algebraic cycles.                  One of the principal investigators will work on motivic                         cohomology; a non-archimedean generalization of the Riemann-Roch                type theorem proved by Gillet and Soule; and a generalization of                Iwasawa theory to cycles and motives.  The other principal                      investigator will work on the existence of higher logarithms                    using families of certain linear configurations over the                        Grassmannians, as well as explore the relationship between the                  Grassmannian complex and the K-groups of the ground field.                           This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
