 "awd_abstract_narration": "Associative learning is one of the basic processes of knowledge                 acquisition, and one that is generally recognized to be central                 to the scientific understanding of human memory and cognition.                  Dr. Wagner's research follows in an approach to characterizing                  the fundamental mechanisms involved that is shared by a                         substantial group of investigators, namely the use of a simple,                 experimentally well-controllable instance of associative learning               about which a great deal of supporting behavioral and biological                information is available (in this case, Pavlovian-like eyeblink                 conditioning in the rabbit), and the attempted development of a                 quantitative, \"neural-network\" account of the regularities                      observed.                                                                                                                                                       The focus of Dr. Wagner's research at this juncture is on the                   manner in which associative learning appears to involve                         distinguishable emotional and non-emotional components that,                    although experimentally separable, may generally interact, with                 emotional associations having the effect of modulating the                      behavioral consequences of non-emotional associations.  Studies                 are aimed at providing a better understanding of the conditions                 under which such modulation does or does not occur, the                         consequences it may have for observing related basic phenomena of               learning such as \"long-term habituation,\" where in the stimulus-                response processing sequence it is effected, and whether it is                  limited to the modulation of performance, as has been observed,                 or includes the modulation of associative learning as well.  The                answers to these questions are very basic to providing a                        computational neurobiological theory of associative learning.",
