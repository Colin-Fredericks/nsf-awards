 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zoos have the opportunity to reach a large audience and to                      improve public understanding of biological principles.  Zoos can                go beyond creating an appreciation for nature by actively                       encouraging their visitors to apply these principles and take                   action on behalf of the environment.                                                                                                                            Tropic World:  A Primate's View will improve the interpretation                 of an existing exhibit at Brookfield Zoo by encouraging visitors                to experience a tropical rainforest from a non-human primate's                  perspective.  Visitors will be challenged, by interactive forms                 of interpretation, to explore the similarities and differences                  between themselves and other primates.  This experience will                    provide a framework for visitors to consider their own                          relationship with their environment.                                                                                                                            The project objectives are:                                                                                                                                     1.  To improve public understanding that , like all organisms,                       primates use and depend on their environment.  However,                         humans ar the only primate species that can choose how they                    impact their environment over extended time and space.                                                                                                      2.  to motivate people to act on behalf of the natural world                        through conservation.                                                                                                                                       3.  To contribute to the body of knowledge of how informal                          education affects people's knowledge of natural science                         topics, as well as the behavior of people in relation to                      conservation issues.",
