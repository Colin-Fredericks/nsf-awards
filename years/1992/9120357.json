 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a graduate student who will pursue a Ph.D              through this research, the goal of which is to understand the total             variability of the East Asian monsoon as a component of the earth's             climate system.  The PIs plan to carry out a study of the East                  Asian monsoon rainfall and its relationship with global scale                   variability using advanced time series analyses.  The objectives of             the research are to:                                                                                                                                                 - identify conclusively the principal spatial and temporal                      modes of rainfall variability in East Asian monsoon rainfall                                                                                                    - investigate relationship between EAM rainfall and large                       scale environmental parameters such as SST, radiation,                          circulation in various time domains.                                                                                                                            - use results of analyses to test and validate theories of                      monsoon dynamics                                                                                                                                                This research will make use of both observational data and GCM             output.  Observational data include:  185 stations of 30 years                  daily rainfall data over East Asia, weekly to monthly SST from CAC,             surface wind, SST and cloudiness from COADS, analyzed wind from NMC             and ECMWF, and OLR from NOAA/NESDIS.  Also used are outputs from                long-term integration of the GLA and COLA GCM.  This research is                important because it seeks to understand the processes that control             the East Asian monsoon, a major feature of the climate system.",
