 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research between C.I. Mora and S.G.                Driese (University of Tennessee; lead institution) and D.E.                     Fastovsky (University of Rhode Island) to support ongoing research              on aspects of Paleozoic paleoclimates that are reflected in                     vertic-featured paleosols preserved in the central and southern                 Appalachian sedimentary sequence.  The study takes advantage of the             wide spatial and temporal distribution and climatic-dependency of               these paleosols, as well as their amenability to stable isotopic                analysis.  Morphology, geochemistry, and stable isotopic                        compositions of the vertic paleosols form the database of the                   study.                                                                               Vertic-featured paleosols are exposed in six states,                       representing fluvial and marginal-marine environments from the                  Ordovician through the Permian.  Because vertic paleosols are, by               comparison with other paleosol type, diagnostic of specific                     climatic variables such as annual wet/dry cyclicity and subtropical             to tropical conditions, these paleosols are ideal subjects for the              reconstruction of paleoclimatic variables.  Moreover, the common                occurrence of pedogenic carbonate permits the estimation of annual              rainfall (based upon nodular horizon depth), as well as the                     opportunity to estimate Paleozoic atmospheric pCO2 and to tests of              models of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations throughout most of              the Paleozoic Era.",
