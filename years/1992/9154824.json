 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cal State Poly Pomona will conduct a three-year project                         \"Integrating Science and Mathematics Teaching for the Middle                    School Underrepresented Student\" for two-member teams, one                      mathematics and one science teacher, from each of 18                            middle/junior high schools in Eastern Los Angeles (CA)                          County having high minority populations.  \"Hands-on\",                           integrated, real-life instructional activities will be                          centered around a four-week summer workshop with each year                      having a specific theme integrating topics in the physical,                     life, and earth sciences as well as mathematics.  The themes                    for the first, second and third years are THE ENVIRONMENT,                      CONSUMER DECISION-MAKING, and SPACESHIP EARTH, respectively.                    During the workshop the teachers will as students experience                    active, learner-centered involvement in their own learning.                     Project staff includes district middle school teachers and                      supervisors as well as university science, mathematics, and                     engineering faculty experienced in school inservice content                     and pedagogy activities.   The summer experience will then                      serve as a model of instructional strategies and content for                    the teachers to use in their own classes during the ensuing                     year, with monthly classroom visits and phone consultation                      between the participants and institute staff providing                          reinforcement and support for developing classrooms where a                     positive attitude toward science and mathematics will result                    in proportionately higher enrollment in those advanced                          courses after middle school.  Year-round evaluation                             activities will include measuring this effect, with three                       one-day conferences of all participants being held each of                      the three school years and all science and mathematics                          teachers participating in the last two conferences.                                                                                                             Cal Poly Pomona and participating school districts cost                         sharing accounts for 25.7% of the NSF budget contribution.",
