 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal addresses the fundamental ecological cause               of outbreaks of damaging forest insects in China and the United                 States.  In this proposal experiments are outlined that will test               the role of forest stand conditions (age, density, genotype) in                 predisposing pine forests to outbreak by an economically                        important group of forest defoliators - pine sawflies                           (Hymenoptera:  Diprionidae).  Despite extensive literature                      implicating stands conditions as a major factor in forest insect                outbreaks little is known about the fundamental mechanisms                      responsible for this universal phenomenon.  Nearly identical pine               sawfly outbreak patterns occur in Pinus ponderosa forests of the                western United States and Pinus yunnanenis forests of central                   China.  Pine sawfly outbreaks are restricted to low density                     stands of a restricted age class.                                                                                                                               A strongly experimental approach is proposed to rigorously test                 the importance of stand conditions in predisposing trees to                     sawfly outbreaks in both China and the US.  Stand manipulations                 will be conducted to experimentally create stand densities that                 replicate the densities of stands known to support pine sawfly                  outbreaks.  The importance of two hypothesized mechanisms for the               observed outbreak patterns will be tested.  The basic                           experimental design is to conduct parallel studies in Sichuan                   Province, China and Arizona, USA.                                                                                                                               Specific research activities to be conducted include a 1 month                  visit by Dr. Wagner and 4-6 months of field research each year by               a doctoral student and research technicians from Northern Arizona               University.  This research will assisted by a scientists and                    research staff of the Experiment Center of Sichuan Provincial                   Academy of Forestry Science.  Similarly a scientist from the                    Sichuan Forestry Academy will conduct research in Arizona for 4-6               months each year for two years.  Short term visits by Chinese                   scientists to research facilities and study areas in the US will                also be supported.  Dr. Wagner and Mr. Hend Xiao both have                      extensive previous experience working with pine sawflies on pine                species.  This project will improve our basic understanding of                  the causes of forest insect outbreaks, improve the training of US               and Chinese scientists, and enhance scientific and cultural                     exchange between China and the United States.",
