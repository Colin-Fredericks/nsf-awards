Meyer of the                             University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Barbara                          Loeb L. of Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Chile.                              The project will focus on the design, synthesis,                                characterization, and systematic investigation of the                           properties of a novel class of monomeric and                                    multinuclear ligand-bridged metal complexes.                                                                                                                    The research aims to synthesize trans-- (poly)pyridyl                           (d)6 metal complexes of Os(II), Ru(II), and Re(I), in                           which intramolecular photochemical and electrochemical                          electron transfer processes from spatially controlled                           electron donor and acceptor sites can be studied.  The                          project will pursue three different approaches to                               synthesizing these trans- metal complexes in order to                           (1) compare the solution phase photophysical responses                          of the trans complexes with those of cis analogs; and                           (2) assemble uniform monolayers of these trans                                  complexes on the surface of metal oxide electrodes to                           explore possible molecular diode-type rectifying                                behavior.  The collaboration is expected to lead to                             the development of new molecular systems that will                              allow more thorough investigation of intramolecular                             electron transfer events.  The Chilean team has                                 synthetic expertise, facilities, and manpower for                               performing the syntheses most efficiently.  The U.S.                            side will gain knowledge to duplicate synthetic                                 development in the U.S.  By observing in the U.S.                               methods of photophysical and electrochemical                                    investigations of the anticipated new compounds, the                            Chileans will gain experience needed to establish a                             laboratory in Chile.",
