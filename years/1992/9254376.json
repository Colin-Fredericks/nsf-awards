 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adoption of technology by education has always lagged                       behind the same technology's widespread use by other                            segments of society.  The pace of technology development,                       and the impact this pace has on society, coupled with the                       massive problems of science and mathematics education in                        this country, has made this time lag no longer tenable.  As                     a society, we can not afford inefficient and limited use of                     the capabilities of technology to help educators attack the                     problems of education for all citizens.                                                                                                                         The full participation of educational professional                              associations in defining a policy along these lines is a                        fundamental component of planning how to accelerate the pace                    of adoption of technology by education.  The presence of                        many such associations in the Washington, DC area offers a                      good opportunity for taking first steps towards assessing                       teh state of knowledge by educational leaders, and for                          creating a forum to help coordinate their activities.                                                                                                           The outcome of this project will be a clearer definition of                     who are the stakeholders for the incorporation of                               technologies in education, a membership profile of the                          associations, their leaders, and their technology awareness                     and plans, and a series of targeted forums and discussions                      where educational leaders and NSF program officers can                          interact and explore policy issues related to the adoption                      of telecommunication technologies in education.",
