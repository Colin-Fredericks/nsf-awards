 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chattanooga Public School System will institute a policy                    of continuous improvement and renewal aimed at insuring that                    every graduate is fully prepared for his or her selected                        career path.  Particular stress will be placed on careers in                    technology, math and science.  Key to this project is the                       training and implementation of instruction planning teams in                    each school.  Analogous to quality circles this small group                     of teachers an students will meet every week to reflect on                      the current pattern of curriculum and instruction and design                    changes to it.  Every teacher, and a selected group of                          students, will participate in one planning team.                                Coordination of efforts among teams and across schools will                     be facilitated through a computer bulletin board network.                       National Science Foundation funds will be used for initial                      training of the teams and curriculum committee; for                             purchasing equipment, materials and services necessary to                       implement innovative instructional strategies; and for other                    \"star-up\" costs.  Once instituted the teams will be self-                       regenerating and schools will be restructured to make                           planning team activity a permanent part of regular school                       activity.",
