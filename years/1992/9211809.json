 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves work in four areas of probability and               statistics, the bootstrap, large deviations, random fractals, and               empirical processes indexed by sets.  Research in the bootstrap                 area will involve investigation of the large sample properties of               a general weighted bootstrap, which includes the nonparametric                  and Bayesian bootstraps as special cases.  The research in large                deviations will be centered around a notion of extended                         functional large deviations for partial sums.  Random fractals                  will be studied in empirical increments of various random                       processes.  The behavior of tail empirical processes indexed by                 sets will be studied with an eye towards applications, the most                 prominent being in establishing the consistency and asymptotic                  distribution of various multivariate density and mode estimators.                    Probability theory provides a basis for research in                        statistics.  This research will include both the development of                 new results in probability, as well as their application to                     statistical theory.",
