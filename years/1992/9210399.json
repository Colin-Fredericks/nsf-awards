 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for an experimental study of the               effects of two bases of power derived from the capacity to reward               or to punish others.  Earlier research found that the effects of                punishment power were consistently weaker than those of reward                  power.  A structural imbalance in the power to reward others                    consistently affect behavior by producing asymmetric exchanges                  between actors.  A structural imbalance in the power to punish                  others does not necessarily affect the behavior and actions of                  individuals.  Reward power requires only that actors pursue their               own self interest, but punishment power requires actors to                      monitor and respond contingently to others' actions.  This work                 will continue a series of experiments designed to test a theory                 to explain why reward-and punishment based power have such                      different effects.  The new experiments are testing hypotheses                  derived from an analysis of how actors' assessments of the risk                 of power use and the fairness of power use affect the strategic                 use of reward and punishment-based resources.                                        This research program will make a significant contribution                 to the study of social behavior and the effects of structural                   inequalities in the access to resources and the capacity to                     reward or punish others on individual behavior and social                       exchange.",
