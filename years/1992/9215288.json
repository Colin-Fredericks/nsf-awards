Soft-                                            X-Ray projection lithography is a                                               leading candidate technology for the                                            fabrication of integrated circuits                                              and electronic and optoelectronic                                               devices with design rules reaching                                              ultimately below 0.1 um.  This                                                  topical meeting will highlight                                                  recent advances in critical                                                     component technologies, such as in                                              areas of soft-x-ray optical design,                                             optical component fabrication and                                               characterization, imaging,                                                      multilayer reflective coatings,                                                 sources, resists, registration and                                              alignment systems, mask technology,                                             system integration and IC process                                               engineering.  The first meeting on                                              this subject was held last year at                                              the beginning of major funding of                                               this program by DARPA and DOC.  The                                             support requested from NSF would be                                             used to enable students and postdocs                                            field working in this field who have                                            submitted contributed papers to                                                 attend the meeting and present their                                            work.  This is an important emerging                                            technology, and the requested use of                                            NSF funds for student and postdoc                                               support will be very effective in                                               enhancing the base of trained                                                   researchers in the field.",
