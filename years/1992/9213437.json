 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical intraseasonal oscillations are important to the                   short-term climate variability of tropical latitudes and have                   connections with low-frequency oscillations throughout the global               atmosphere.  Dr. Crum plans to pursue a broad research effort aimed             better understanding of the nature of these oscillations.                       Conditional heating, where forcing of the large-scale circulation               by organized convection occurs in regions of large-scale moisture               convergence, has a significant nonlinear effect in determining the              structure and horizontal scale of these oscillations.  Dr. Crum                 will expand upon previous results on conditional heating using                  linear models which have been modified to allow for interaction of              the tropical waves with the stratosphere and boundary layer.  He                plans to examine factors which control the amplitude of these                   oscillations, focussing on the roles of moisture and static                     stability.  The possible cooperative interaction between convective             clouds and the large scale, crucial to many theories, also will be              tested in a model with explicitly resolved clouds.                                   A better understanding of the tropical intraseasonal                       oscillation will lead eventually to a better prediction of a                    variety of weather phenomena.",
