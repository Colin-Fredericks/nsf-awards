The ultimate goal of this research is to produce a model for the                                                                                                yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans, on apple leaf                       surfaces.

The project has                    implications for both basic ecology (community processes and                    structure) and for the biological control of plant pathogens.",
