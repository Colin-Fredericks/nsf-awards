 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses are now known to be the most numerically dominant form of               life in the world's oceans.  This revelation has raised a myriad of             questions concerning the ecological role of viruses in the oceans.              This study will investigate the genetic significance of                         viruses in the marine environment. Viruses could be a significant               component of the oceanic dissolved (<0.2 um) nucleic acid pools and             they also have the potential to alter bacterial gene                            pools by effecting gene transfer by transduction and viral mediated             transformation.  To investigate the gentic significance of viruses              in the marine environment this study wil pursue the following three             research objectives:  1)  To determine viral abundance in                       estuarine, coastal, and offshore environments in surface and                    subsurface waters, and to develop methods for direct viral                      enumeration in sediments.  The relationship between viral                       abundance and total (autotrophic and heterotrophic) host pool size              will be assessed, as well as the relationship with particulate and              dissolved DNA content.  2)  To determine the proportion of                      particulate and dissolved nucleic acids that are contained in virus             particles in estuarine, coastal, and offshore waters.  Methods will             be developed to quantitate viral DNA directly and relate it to                  bacterial and \"free\" (i.e. soluble as opposed to that encapsulated              in virons) in oceanic samples.  3)  To determine the potential for              gene transfer by transduction in the marine environment by                      investigating the presence of temperate phage and lysogenic host                bacteria.  Using both isolated phage-host systems and natural viral             and bacterial assemblages, the study will determine the presence of             temperate phage/lysogenic hosts by chemical and physical induction              of lysis.  Once  lysogens have been identified, these will be used              in studies on the transfer of chromosomal DNA and broad host range              plasmids by transduction.  This research will begin to                          answer the questions of the role of viruses in the oceanic gene                 pool.",
