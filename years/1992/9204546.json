 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to provide data-recording equipment for a                 fourth magnetometer to be deployed as part of the MAGIC                         magnetometer array as well as to supply spare parts for the                     continued service and operations of the other systems in the array.             Such equipment is critical to the science program to be funded                  under the complementary proposed program from the University of                 Michigan on \"Continuing Operation of a Magnetometer Array on the                Greenland Ice Cap (MAGIC) to Investigate Propagating Ionospheric                Current Systems.\"  Since SRI provided the systems for the present               stations, it is most efficient that they provide equipment for the              final station to be deployed during the 1992 summer field season.               The apparatus includes the following: (1) very low power                        microcomputer with interface to handle the analogue magnetometer                signals, (2) large, low power consumption static random access                  memory, (3) clock providing 1 ms timing precision from Omega system             VLF broadcast signals, and (4) power supply and conversion                      equipment.  The system is packaged in a heavily insulated container             to provide environmental protection for the computer system which               self-heats the enclosure.  Data is stored in the static RAM for                 later interrogation by the experimentor with a memoary sufficient               to store up to one year of 15-s averaged data.",
