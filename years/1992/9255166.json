 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation              (U.T. System AMP) brings together all none universities of The                  University of Texas system and six closely partnering community                 college systems to increase the number of minority students                     enrolling in, graduating from, and entering graduate programs in                mathematics, science, and engineering (MSE).  Activities will be                supported by partnerships with industry and national laboratories.                                                                                              Prominent among participating institutions are those in Border                  regions serving large numbers of Hispanic students and those in                 metropolitan areas serving mainly commuter student, including many              minority students.  Goals set for the proposed AMP are:  1) to                  produce approximately 2,000 minority MSE B.S. graduates each year               by the end of the 1996-97 academic year; and 2( to enroll at least              500 minority graduate students per year in U.T. System                          universities.                                                                                                                                                   The approach proposed is characterized by: 1) high level leadership             for programmatic change; 2) focus on essential, \"gate-keeper\"                   science and mathematics courses; 3) substantive involvement of                  community college partners in curriculum efforts; 4) flexible                   programs for supporting minority student participation in research;             and 5) task forces that bring faculty leaders from different                    institutions together to make systemic changes in undergraduate MSE             education in Texas.  The proposed AMP will cooperate with the Texas             A&M-directed AMP, which includes seven Texas universities; other                major projects; and state agencies.",
