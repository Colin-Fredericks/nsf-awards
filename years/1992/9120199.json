 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be done on the structures, excitations                and thermal properties of physically adsorbed layers on solid                   surfaces.  Modulated monolayer lattices have domain wall structures             with many similarities to structures which occur in the surface                 reconstructions of metals and semiconductors.  The domain wall                  excitations also have analogies to these systems.  Results are used             for statistical mechanical evaluation of thermal properties.  These             phenomena depend on, and provide measures of, the energetic                     topography of the substrate surface.  The substrates treated                    include: the (111) faces of platinum, palladium, copper, and                    silver, and the (001) face of magnesium oxide.  The primary                     adsorbates are the inert gas series, helium to xenon.  Combinations             are chosen which display features present also in more complex                  systems; quantitative atomic scale models are available or can be               constructed by extension of previous work.  The work has ties to                experiments with x-ray diffraction, thermal neutron scattering,                 thermal helium scattering, ellipsometry, and microbalances.                     Theoretical study of the methods for analysing inelastic neutron                scattering from commensurate monolayers will also be undertaken.                The techniques in this work include lattice dynamical analysis,                 continuum elasticity theory and variational quantum mechanics.                  %%%",
