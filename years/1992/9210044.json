 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the combinatorics of 3-                     manifolds.  Specifically, it studies Heegaard surfaces of 3-                    manifolds, essential maps between Haken 3-manifolds, and the outer              automorphism group of Haken 3-manifold groups.  Part of the work                involves development of practical algorithms, e.g., for                         constructing surfaces of specified types in 3-manifolds.                             The study of 3-dimensional manifolds is aided by the fact that             our experience of living in such a space endows us with a strong                intuition for what can and cannot take place.  Studying the                     topology of higher dimensional manifolds is necessarily dependent               upon the algebraic machinery available to assist in it, but in                  dimension 3 we also have at our disposal a direct avenue of                     perception.  It is therefore surprising to learn that some                      questions that have natural generalizations to higher dimensions                have been answered already for these higher cases, while the 3-                 dimensional case that inspired them remains obdurately                          unassailable.  There is a classical conjecture of Poincare about                spheres that is the most notorious example of this phenomenon.                  What appears to be at work in thus violating our natural over-                  estimate of the advantage that geometric intuition should confer in             dimension 3?  It is at least partly a naive faith in intuition and              mistrust of computation, but it is also the fact that the known                 methods of computation perform best with the luxury of excess                   dimensions in which to maneuver.  They are somehow cramped in the               presence of only three dimensions.  Bearing this in mind, one can               see that the investigator's nitty-gritty combinatorial                          constructions and algorithmic computations may just possibly be the             brute force that is essential to progress in dimension 3.",
