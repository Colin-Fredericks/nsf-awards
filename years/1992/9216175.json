 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trans-Kingdom gene flow is defined as the transfer of genetic                   information between two organisms whose phylogenetic affinities                 place them in different kingdoms.  The recent demonstration of                  trans-kingdom gene flow involving bacteria and yeast increased                  Plumley's awareness of this process - a process which has been well             documented in the agrobacterium/plant association.  This project                will address the hypothesis that trans-kingdom gene flow has                    resulted in the homogenization of genetic information within the                marine environment.  Plumley will use paralytic shellfish poisoning             as a model system since current data indicate that evolutionarily               disparate organisms, i.e., bacteria, dinoflagellates, and                       cyanobacteria, all have the unique set of genes required to produce             the diverse and complicated array of paralytic shellfish poisoning              toxins.  Plumley hypothesizes that the ability to produce paralytic             shellfish poisoning toxins evolved only once and that the genes                 were subsequently transferred to other organisms.  A research goal              is to isolate the gene that codes for paralytic shellfish poisoning             toxins.  Long range goals of the research are to eradicate                      paralytic shellfish poisoning and to understand the mechanisms and              extent of trans-kingdom gene transfer in the marine environment.                The project represents preliminary research on an untested                      hypothesis and attempts to answer a long-standing marine health                 problem using modern approaches.",
