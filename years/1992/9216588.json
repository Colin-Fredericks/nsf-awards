 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has been a development of a                               theory of supervisory control systems based on the                              formalism of discrete event systems.  Although this                             emergent framework is now limited due to its                                    historical roots in specific applications such as the                           management of data communications and certain                                   classes of manufacturing process, its results are                               compelling and suggestive of a much wider range of                              applicability.  The key question  is whether the                                underlying conceptual framework is  rich enough, or                             can be expanded, to accommodate systems and                                     operations as complex as power  networks.  There                                are two principal issues to address.  The first is                              modeling.  The second is the supervisor synthesis                               problem, i.e., how should the supervisory controller                            -the decision making process-be organized?  Finally,                            we propose to evaluate theoretical constructs in the                            context of power system security supervision.  In                               this instance both the modeling and controller                                  synthesis issues are far more complex than in any                               other situation to which the supervisor synthesis                               formulation has been applied.  It is certain  that the                          application will  enunciate previously unaddressed                              theoretical questions.  On the other hand, power                                system security supervisors have evolved to the                                 point where decision makers are so overloaded with                              analytical tools and data that the most of that                                 knowledge and power is not useable in real time.  It                            is our goal to demonstrate, in a limited formulation,                           that the proposed theoretical framework that can                                systematically organize both the knowledge base                                 and the decision making order that these systems                                can function when required.",
