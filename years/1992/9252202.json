 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to help beginning physics                   students make the transition from high school to college                        physics instruction.  The student are being helped to take                      responsibility for his/her own learning by providing physics                    instruction in an environment with a heavy emphasis on direct                   observation and active student involvement.  The already well-                  integrated laboratories at Jamestown Community College are                      being enhanced by the addition of computer data acquisition                     systems at each lab bench.  Students, working in pairs or                       threes, are using this equipment to verify the laws of physics,                 by directly measuring force, motion, temperature, displacement,                 magnetic fields, etc., and by using computer tools such as                      spreadsheets, mathematical and graphics packages, and data                      acquisition software designed by Tools for Scientific Thinking                  at Tufts University.  Furthermore, a powerful mathematics and                   graphing program called Mathematica is also being used to help                  students deal with difficult mathematics concepts.  Via this                    project the college is building the laboratory resources                        necessary to move gradually toward a heavily observation-based                  approach to introductory physics, consistent with the nature of                 physics as an observation-based discipline.  Nine Macintosh                     IIsi computers, equipped with Vernier U.L.I. data acquisition                   boards and analysis software, are being networked to a Quadra                   900, which runs Mathematica 2.0, which was purchased earlier.                   This project has been designed in consultation with faculty at                  several colleges and universities.  This cooperation should                     enhance the chances of project success and replication.",
