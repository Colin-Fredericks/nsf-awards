 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multidisciplinary study will be conducted to test the                         hypothesis that planktivorous seabirds will concentrate their                   foraging where tidal and sub-tidal currents, interacting with                   bathymetry, transport and concentrate zooplankton near the                      surface in spatially predictable upwellings and fronts.  It is                  hypothesized that quasi-permanent fronts, caused by horizontal                  gradients in mixing associated with gradients in tidal velocity                 and bottom depth, will be of importance to the birds.  Physical                 processes and plankton distributions in both shallow (100 m) and                deep (600 m) passes near Buldir Island will be compared, as will                avian responses to concentrations of prey in both the horizontal                and vertical dimensions.  Advanced technologies including an                    Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), an integrating                        echosounder, multiple opening-closing nets (MOCNESS) and                        computerized data entry and real-time analyses of results to                    optimize use of the ship will be employed.  The study provides a                unique opportunity to combine the benefits of new technologies                  for investigating how physical processes affect the distribution                and concentration of plankton that support higher trophic levels.               The study will be one of the few to examine simultaneously                      physical processes, zooplankton distributions and abundance, and                the foraging ecology of marine birds in the western Aleutians.                  This suite of information will permit comparison of the marine                  ecology of seabirds on oceanic islands with that of seabirds on                 nearby continental islands studied previously.",
