 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spectral absorption lines of hot, rapidly rotating \"B\" type                 stars show traveling \"bumps\" which travel across the lines with                 time.  Although these bumps were first thought to move periodically             in a predictable way, leading to an interpretation that traveling               waves (nonradial pulsations) were responsible, new data indicate                that the bumps are often missing.  In order to judge whether this               apparent unpredictability is caused by the \"beating\" of different               pulsation modes or by an aperiodic phenomenon, long strings of                  spectroscopic data are needed.  In the past long \"campaigns\" have               been difficult to undertake because of practical scheduling and                 allocation problems at national facilities.  In early 1992 Georgia              State will put into operation its new spectroscopic \"Multi-                     Telescope Telescope. This facility will have a large effective                  light gathering power and a Charged-Couple Device detector and                  will permit the PI to obtain large amounts of data to examine                   the frequency of the \"profile bump\" phenomenon in rapidly rotating              B stars and to ascertain its periodic nature.  The PI also believes             that the large database assembled will enable him to determine                  whether nonradial pulsations are responsible for episodic mass loss             in the enigmatic group of rapidly rotating \"Be\" stars.",
