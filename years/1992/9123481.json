 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries award will                                 support the research collaboration of Professor Mark                            Ashbaugh of the university of Missouri, Columbia, and                           Professor Raphael Benguria of the Pontificia                                    Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The project aims to                             solve conjectures related to the mathematical                                   dimensions of circular drums.                                                                                                                                   The researchers propose to develop good bounds for the                          ratio of the first overtone to the fundamental tone in                          \"warped\" drums, which span a closed curve in three-                             dimensional space.  They will also consider other                               types of surfaces, such as a piece of a sphere's                                surface, which are of great importance to the geometry                          of curved surfaces.  Through techniques used in                                 earlier collaborations, the investigators will examine                          bounds for ratios o other tones as well, in order to                            improve existing bounds and perhaps obtain the optimal                          bound, along with the shape that gives the optimal                              result.  The research is expected to yield substantial                          contributions to the general area of eigenvalue bounds                          for differential operators.  The u.S. side will gain                            from continued collaboration with a Chilean expert in                           this area.  The Chilean side will benefit from                                  continued direct participation with a U.S.                                      counterpart.",
