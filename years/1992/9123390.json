 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Sharer, Ms Loa Traxler will                   collect data for her doctoral dissertation thesis.  She will                    participate in the excavation of the Acropolis of Copan and                     determine how architectural construction changed over time.                     Copan, located in Honduras, is one of the major Mayan sites and                 it documents the rise and subsequent decline of Mayan society.  A               large mound or \"Acropolis\" marks the center of the site and                     consists of superimposed temples, palace buildings and other                    structures. Although other Mayan sites also contain such a                      sequence of buildings, Copan is unique because an erosional cut                 along the eastern portion allows ready access to all major                      construction levels and presents a rare opportunity for extensive               exposure of superimposed architecture.  Dr. Sharer and his                      colleagues have developed a tunneling strategy which lets them                  follow buried walls and reconstruct building size and shape. Ms                 Traxler will continue to collect and analyze such data.                                                                                                         In Middle America, archaeologists have tended to concentrate                    either on monumental structures which provide insight into elite                behavior or on smaller outlying sites associated with lower class               status.  The site of Copan is particularly important because of                 the long term settlement pattern survey and excavations which                   have focussed on the latter.  As a result of this work,                         archaeologists now understand how population changed over time                  and how the utilization of the Copan Valley changed.  Within this               context, the data which Ms Traxler will collect is extremely                    important because it will permit her to examine how these two                   levels of society interacted.                                                                                                                                   This research will provide new insight into the rise and decline                of Mayan civilization.  It will result in data of interest to a                 large group of archaeologists and assist in the training of an                  extremely promising young scientist.",
