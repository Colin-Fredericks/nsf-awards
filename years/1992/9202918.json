 "awd_abstract_narration": "New theoretical and computational methods for computer simulation               studies of biomolecular systems will be developed.  These methods               will be applied to help explain the activity of several systems                 of chemical and biological interest.  More specifically,                        effective potential energy functions that are more accurate than                those in common use for molecular dynamics simulations will be                  created by explicit inclusion of electronic polarization.  Other                potential functions that are more approximate but that can be                   evaluated rapidly will be created by implicit treatment of                      solvent.  Applications will be made to molecular recognition in                 host-receptor systems, to the dynamics of enzyme-substrate                      interactions, and to the kinetics of enzymatic reactions.                       %%%                                                                             The significance of the work lies in the provision of new tools                 for designing drugs, enzymes, ion channels, and other molecules                 for practical applications; in the deepening understanding of the               activity of biological molecules; and in the preparation of young               scientists for research careers in this emerging field.",
