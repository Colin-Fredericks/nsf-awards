 "awd_abstract_narration": "tRNA splicing is essential for the survival of some, if not                     all, eukaryotes.  The mechanism of tRNA splicing is highly                      conserved in eukaryotes, and best understood in the yeast                       Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Superficially, tRNA splicing appears                 simple; an endonuclease excises the intron; a ligase joins the                  two half-molecules; and a 2'-dephosphorylating activity removes                 the 2'-phosphate left at the splice junction.  Yet the mechanism                of splicing, particularly of the last step, is much more                        complicated than one would imagine.  Removal of the splice                      junction 2'-phosphatase, rather than being catalyzed by a                       phosphatase, is catalyzed by an NAD-dependent, 2'-phosphate                     specific phosphotransferase.  A protein like this has never                     been described, yet it is likely essential in some, if not all,                 eukaryotes in order to make functional TRNA.  Moreover, the                     phosphate from the splice junction of TRNA ultimately ends up                   as a cyclic phosphate on NAD, or on a molecule similar to NAD.                  Such a molecule has also not been previously described.  The                    objects of this proposal are to identify the proteins                           catalyzing this unusual but important dephosphorylation step in                 TRNA splicing and to determine the structure (and mechanism of                  formation) of the unusual phosphotransfer product.                              %%%                                                                             The process of processing newly synthesized transfer RNA (TRNA) in              yeast is essential for the TRNA to act in the synthesis of a                    protein.  A significant part of the processing involves editing out             particular sequences of bases in the strand.  This research                     involves an enzyme which closes a gap in the TRNA strand (much like             the process by which train cars are linked up after the cars in the             center have been removed).  The enzyme has some novel properties                which merit investigation  to distinguish it from other ligating                enzymes .  The information resulting from these studies will be new             and important since the research is original.",
