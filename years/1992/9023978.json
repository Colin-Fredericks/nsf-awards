 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the research and programmatic activities             of the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications located at                the University of Minnesota.  The Institute for Mathematics and Its             Applications (IMA) is a unique National Science Foundation                      institute addressing a national need.  The IMA is reviving and                  strengthening the natural and historic ties between the                         mathematical sciences and other sciences and engineering and                    between academic scholarship and industrial research.  The IMA                  programs identify problems and areas of mathematical sciences                   research of concern to other sciences, encourage the development                and study of new areas of the mathematical sciences, and stimulate              collaboration between mathematical scientists and other scientists.             The IMA encourages participation of mathematical sciences in areas              of application by: providing an atmosphere conducive to the                     solution of major problems in various areas of the mathematical                 sciences; presenting important scientific and technological                     problems that provide real challenges to mathematical scientists;               and demonstrating that research in the mathematical sciences has                significant impact in science and engineering.                                       Yearly IMA programs are carefully chosen to provide a meeting              ground for mathematical scientists with engineers and scientists                from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  A year's                 topic may be in an area of application which requires a number of               different mathematical fields, or it may be a broad area of the                 mathematical sciences known to have applications in a number of                 scientific disciplines.  A typical yearly program is designed                   around a cadre of senior scientists who are in residence for                    periods of three to ten months.  These senior scientists provide                continuity for the program and scientific guidance for the                      postdoctoral members.  The mentoring of postdoctoral fellows is a               key component of the IMA programs.  In addition to National Science             Foundation support, the IMA is supported by 24 sponsoring                       universities and 13 sponsoring corporations.",
