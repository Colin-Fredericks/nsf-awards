 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to investigate the general                       proposition that stable political and legal institutions are key                ingredients for the secure property rights needed to induce                     investment in and conservation of natural resource and                          environmental assets.  The focus of attention will be on the way                tropical forests are used in developing countries and the primary               goal is to assess, empirically, the importance of stable                        political and legal institutions to observed measures of the way                these resources are used.  This work will be carried out first by               developing a theoretical framework that relates insecurity of                   tenure to the conservation incentives of private resource owners                and public resource managers.  Empirical analysis, based on the                 theoretical framework, will compare the principal hypothesis to                 two alternatives, that tropical deforestation and similar                       phenomena are caused by the process of economic growth, and that                the primary cause of these outcomes is population pressure.                                                                                                     Principal data sources have been identified to provide the                      information needed for the empirical work.  These sources provide               data of three types that are needed to examine the hypothesis of                interest: (1) indicators of tropical forest and other natural                   resource use in developing countries;  (2) measures of legal and                political conditions in these countries;  (3) information on                    social and economic conditions.   Major effort will be directed                 to data collection and exploratory econometric analysis.",
