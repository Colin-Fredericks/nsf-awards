 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray satellites have discovered a new and common group \"binary\"                systems in which both stars have low (solar-like) masses.  Other                properties of them are poorly known largely because they are at                 great distances from the Sun and in directions where absorption by              interstellar gas makes their true brightnesses and hence distances              ambiguous.  In previous work the Principal Investigator (PI) has                discovered the optical counterparts to these new x-ray sources and              has monitored their optical output and radial velocities to learn               more about their binary characteristics that enable us to                       understand the reason for their x-ray emission.  In the present                 three year study the PI will study a sample of these objects in                 the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Because these sources are at a               common distance their properties can actually be defined better                 than those in our own Galaxy.  This work is expected to delineate               differences between x-ray sources in our Galaxy and the LMC, for                example, in terms of differences in heavy metal content.  The PI's              past work has led to the discovery of the first black-hole in an                eclipsing binary (leading to a direct estimate of the mass of the               black hole).  This work is expected also to clarify the existence               of these exotic objects.",
