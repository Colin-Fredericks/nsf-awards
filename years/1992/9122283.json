 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops estimation methods that use simulations to                overcome the computational burdens of numerically complex                       econometric models.  This is a very important line of research                  because many economic problems are intractable even using                       supercomputers.  Many applied economists must consciously design                models to avoid computationally intractable aspects, even though                the economics of the issue naturally lead in that direction.                    This project generalizes the simulated moments methods, uses it                 to solve complicated empirical economic problems and extends a                  new class of semi-parametric estimators for linear index models                 developed by the investigator under his previous NSF grant.                                                                                                     The method of simulated moments is generalized to limited                       dependent variable models besides the conditional multinomial                   Probit model and to inference problems associated with                          approximating moment functions like the score of the log-                       likelihood.  The research in computation addresses the existence                and nondifferentiability of simulated moments estimators.  The                  second part of the research is an empirical application of                      simulated moments estimation methods to the analysis of labor                   supply with nonlinear taxes.  The third part of the research is                 about semi-parametric estimation of index models.  Asymptotic                   distribution theory for a class of estimators for linear index                  models will be derived and the relationship between this family                 of estimators and others is explored.",
