 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been the goal of many researchers to measure the                   effects of the extraordinary technical improvements in computing                markets.  Yet is has been very difficult to place an economic value             on such improvements.   One means for doing so measures a buyer's               satisfaction with a product, or \"buyer's surplus\" -- the difference             between what a buyer was willing to pay and what he actually paid.              A proper measure of buyer's surplus provides an index of the value              to users from a cheaper system or a technically more proficient                 system.  What has prevented research on surplus in the computer                 market is a absence of sufficiently detailed data on the micro-                 behavior of computer users.  This research will fill this gap.  It              will develop and use a detailed and rich new data set containing                about 70 percent of all medium to large computer users in the                   United States.   A related goal  of this research is to shed light              on the many factors influencing the diffusion on new computer                   equipment.  Since much technical improvement is embodied in new                                                                                                 generations of hardware, the economy can only benefit from                      technical advance when that new generation of equipment is                      purchased.  This research will approach these issues as questions               about the factors underlying the demand for computing.  It will                 analyze the factors determining the decision to adopt technically               advanced computing equipment.",
