The methods to be used consist of analytical tools from                    theoretical particle physics and large-scale computer                           simulations of non-linear field theories, designed to model                     the dynamics of phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry                      breaking in an expanding Universe.  Applications to the                         construction of models of particle interactions and to the                      impact of phase transitions on cosmology will be analyzed in                    detail.                                                                              It is expected that the results obtained by this research                  activity will help clarify many of the complex issues that                      arise when one examines some of the fundamental problems of                     particle physics and cosmology, such as the excess of matter                    over antimatter in the Universe, as well as the origin of its                   rich large-scale structure.",
