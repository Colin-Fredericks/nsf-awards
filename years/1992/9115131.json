 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novae, dwarf novae, novae-like stars are all thought to be pairs                of stars in which a \"main sequence\" star is slowly expanding and                transferring some of its matter onto an orbiting \"white dwarf.\"                 The heating of fresh hydrogen from the first star results in                    thermonuclear reactions on the white dwarf's surface, leading                   to a vast class of rapid brightenings we observe as nova-type                   stars.  Many astronomers are trying to understand whether each of               these systems is the same type of object in a different stage of                evolution or whether they are fundamentally different types of                  objects.  In this two-year study the Principal Investigator (PI)                and a student will monitor a dozen binary stars that have under-                gone nova eruptions in the past to examine the periods and other                orbital characteristics that would lead to improved estimates                   of these stars' masses and radii.  This is expected to double                   the number of stars for which these fundamental parameters are                  known and to permit a better estimate to be made of the                         distribution of their periods.  The PI anticipates that this                    study will contribute to resolving whether nova undergo rapid                   mass transfer events followed by little exchanges between the                   two stars over longer times.  A resolution of this issue will                   help determine whether novae, dwarf novae, and nova-like systems                are the same system merely observed in different stages of                      evolution.  This is an award under the auspices of the NSF's                    Research for Undergraduate Institutions program and is expected                 to contribute to the scientific instruction of graduate and                     undergraduate students at the PI's institution.",
