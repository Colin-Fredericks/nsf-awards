 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the              general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfield of surface microscopy.  During the five-year tenure of                 this award, Professor Hamers and his students will utilize                      scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques to                   observe, understand, and control the surface chemistry of solid                 state materials at an atomic level.  These important goals will be              pursued by using STM techniques to identify molecular surface                   species; through the integration of STM with other chemically                   sensitive techniques such as infrared absorption spectroscopy;                  through the development of novel scanned probe techniques which                 could provide new methods for achieving elemental and/or                        functional group identification on nanometer distance scales; and               by making use of the STM tip as an active tool for inducing                     chemical changes in this distance domain.                                       %%%                                                                             The successful attainment of the goals of this project should give              rise to new techniques for the atomic-scale characterization of                 solid surfaces as well as innovative chemical insights regarding                surface reactions which are of immense technological significance.              Additionally, this Presidential Faculty Fellowship should                       significantly assist Professor Hamers in the continuing                         development of his vital and productive program of research and                 research training.",
