 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to enable ten classroom teachers              to conduct in-depth research projects in teaching and learning in               their classrooms and to provide the necessary support and mentoring             activities for them to plan, carry out, document, write up, and                 share the results of their research.  The proposed teacher research             projects fall under three general headings: a) The effects of a                 visual mathematics curriculum on student learning; b) The effects               of self assessment on student learning; and c) Comparisons of                   teacher perceptions vs. student perceptions of particular classroom             issues.  Monthly meetings in the fall of 1991 have been held to                 plan and focus the teacher research projects.  Classroom research               projects will be conducted by the teachers for the period of                    January to June 1992.  During the summer of 1992, a week long                   workshop with the teachers will be held in order to share and write             up the results of their research projects.  At the end of the                   summer workshop the teacher-researchers will each choose a                      colleague from their school to form a research dyad for the 1992-               1993 school year.  Results of the teacher-research projects will be             shared by the teachers in their own schools, at the Oregon Math                 Leaders Conference in summer of 1992, and at the Northwest                      Mathematics Meeting in fall of 1993.  Monthly pull back meetings                will be held during the 1992-1993 school year to provide                        opportunities for the research dyads to share the progress of their             projects with each other and with the principal investigators.//",
