 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate new                            techniques for the control design of flexible AC                                transmission system (FACTS) devices for the                                     mitigation of multiple interarea modes of                                       oscillations.  The focal point of the investigation is                          the design of damping controllers which are robust                              with respect to variations in loading conditions and                            system configurations.  By modeling the changes in                              operating conditions as uncertainties, the robust                               damping controller design will be formulated as and                             H00 robust stability problem.  A multi-modal                                    decomposition based on synchronizing and damping                                torques will be used to provide an appropriate                                  design structure to establish non-conservative                                  uncertainty models.                                                             The proposal consists of the following research                                 areas: (l) development of the multi-modal                                       decomposition, (2) FACTS device siting and                                      feedback signal selection, (3) development of                                   uncertainty models, (4) computation of multi-modal                              decomposition in large power systems, (5) robust                                control design of a single FACTS device, and (6)                                robust decentralized control coordination of                                    multiple FACTS devices.  It is anticipated that a                               rigorous robust control design methodology based                                on synchronizing and damping torques for multiple                               swing modes will developed.  The technique will                                 appeal directly to power system control design                                  engineers.  The power system models will set up                                 using the Power System Toolbox developed by the                                 proposer.  The control design process will be                                   investigated using Matlab.  Design examples will be                             solicited from utilities and equipment                                          manufacturers.",
