 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to characterize the structure,             assembly and inter-relationships of the feedback sensitive enzymes              of arginine biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa.  The first seven                 biosynthetic enzymes, including the feedback-sensitive enzymes,                 acetylglutamate synthase and acetylglutamate kinase, are localized              in the mitochondria.  The structural and functional relationships               between acetylglutamate synthase, acetylglutamate kinase and                    acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase will be investigated to evaluate             various models for coordination of feedback inhibition, enzyme                  synthesis and assembly.  The leader sequences and sequences                     involved in processing the polyprotein precursor of acetylglutamate             kinase and acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase will be identified.               A molecular analysis will be performed to investigate the                       biological role and evolutionary origin of this complex gene                    organization.  The arg-14 gene will be cloned and sequenced to                  confirm (or confound) its identiy as a structural gene.  Genetic                and biochemical analyses will be performed to ascertain the role(s)             of acetylglutamate kinase in synthesis, processing, assembly and                functioning of acetylglutamate synthase.  The specificity,                      kinetics, energetics, and regulation of metabolite trafficking and              the possible relationships between mitochondrial, plasma and                    vacuolar membrane transport systems will be investigated.  The                  components of the transport systems will be identified by                       conventional biochemical methods or by labelling with photolabile               amino acid derivatives.  Attempts will be made to isolate and                   characterize mutations affecting their function.  The results will              be of signifcance in understanding metabolic regulation and the                 assembly of mitochondria (and other organelles) in eukaryotic                   cells.",
