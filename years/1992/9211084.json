 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern imaging technologies are capable of producing three-                     dimensional scenes for use in scientific, industrial and medical                applications, thus presenting the need for image processing and                 image analysis algorithms designed for manipulating 3-D volume                  data sets.  Three-dimensional images in general, and biomedical                 images in particular, present large scale computationally-                      intensive image analysis problems especially amenable to parallel               processing solutions.  In order to fully exploit high                           performance/supercomputing technologies and move biological image               processing to a parallel environment, two key research areas must               be investigated.  The first is intelligent algorithm design for                 the most efficient means of programming parallel processors.                    Parallel computing versus sequential computing algorithms for 3-D               biomedical image processing will be studied utilizing a                         Connection Machine 2 (CM-2) 16k fine-grain single-instruction                   multiple-data stream (SIMD) supercomputing node, a Stardent GS-                 2025 four-processor vector computer and a conventional serial SUN               Microsystems reduced instruction set computer (RISC).  The                      second topic to be studied is the interprocessor communication                  bottleneck in large scale image processing.  The use of data                    structures and programming methods appropriate for efficient                    manipulation of large data sets will be investigated.  The                      algorithm design will be generic, modular and flexible so that                  the software can be easily modified as needed with hardware                     technology improvements.  This can reduce the cost of high                      performance processing and assist in bringing massively parallel                computing into the general scientific community for use as a                    research and teaching tool with broader applicability.  Results                 of this investigation will be applied to biomedical images.",
