 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the process of fusion between cells                and Herpes simplex virus (HSV). This is a pH-independent mechanism              and is different from pH-dependent endocytosis. The cells to be                 used are human embryonic lung (HEL) cells, which are highly                     susceptible to HSV infection, and X cells \u0131mammalian, non-human                 primary epithelial cells!, which produce low yields of infectious               HSV. It is postulated that two types of attachment by the virus to              the cell may be necessary for successful fusion. Heparan sulfate                has been shown to be important in attachment and infection of HSV;              its presence in X cells will be determined. HEL cells may contain               another molecule necessary for fusion which is lacking in X cells;              fusions will be made at various cell ratios to see whether levels               of infectivity are altered. Additionally, genomic DNA from HEL                  cells will be transfected into X cells along with a selectible                  marker, to see if the X cells then become susceptible to HSV.                   Antibodies which inhibit infection of human cells by HSV will also              be prepared.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Herpes simplex virus is a human pathogen; other members of the same             family are major animal pathogens. Not all cell types are equally               susceptible to HSV infection. This proposal is to study the                     mechanism by which HSV and cells undergo fusion and allow the virus             to enter and infect the cells. Two types of attachment sites may be             needed for the virus to infect successfully. One component (heparan             sulfate) is known to be important in cell-virus attachment; its                 presence on a cell type which is not very sensitive to the virus                will be determined. If a second type of molecule is present on                  susceptible cells and not on resistant cells, it should be possible             to fuse these cells in different ratios by known techniques, then               see what level of HSV infection results. DNA from susceptible cells             will be inserted into resistant cells, to see whether they become               susceptible to infection. Antibodies which block HSV entry into                 cells will also be prepared. The information will add to knowledge              of the general properties which allow membranes to fuse in many                 cellular processes.",
