 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hernando Trujillo has been awarded a Postdoctoral                           Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Truillo's doctoral degree was from                 Dartmouth with Professor Russell Hughes. He plans to continue                   research with Professor Didier Astruc at Bordeaux. In Atruc's                   laboratory, he will learn about electron chain catalysis with                   transition metal catalysts. This will also bring him into                       contact with techniques stuch as Mossbauer spectroscopy, cyclic                 voltammetry and ESR. These experiences will help him with his                   long range goal of studying highly strained molecules and                       addressing the questions of their reactivity.                                   %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                   meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
