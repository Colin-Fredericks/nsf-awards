 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Martin A. Uman and several                        junior members of his research group at the University of                       Florida to collaborate in a study of the behavior of lightning                  with Professor Michel Ianoz and others of the Laboratory of                     Electrical Energy Research, Swiss Federal Institute of                          Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland.  They will carry out                         research in the modeling of return strokes and the                              applications of these models to horizontal power line coupling                  of close lightning strokes.  The research plan expands and                      enhances Dr. Uman's ongoing cooperative research with this                      group and others at the Universities of Bologna and Rome,                       Italy.  It makes use of measurements obtained by the U.S. and                   Swiss research groups at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in                       1991, using Swiss equipment.  The collaborators also plan to                    collect more data from further joint experiments.                                                                                                               This research will advance basic knowledge about lightning and                  its possible electromagnetic interactions.  Its applications                    are of particular importance to electric power distribution                     systems in the United States and elsewhere.  It links three                     very strong research groups and provides an outstanding                         training opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral                     fellows in Dr. Uman's research group at the University of                       Florida.",
