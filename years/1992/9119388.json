 "awd_abstract_narration": "The X-ray Crystollography Group in the Department of Biological                 Sciences at Purdue has pioneered a variety of methods, techniques               and computer software for the determination of the structures of                the macromolecules.  It has achieved major advances in the study                of virus structures and, over the years has developed a                         foundation of computer programs for film processing, phase                      determination, model building, structure refinement, and so on,                 leading to the solution and investigation of macromolecular                     structures.                                                                                                                                                     Computing is currently one of the bottlenecks in this research.                 The gap between the computing resources needed and the ones                     available increases as new radiation sources for X-rays become                  available.  This group can maintain its position as the leader in               the field by migrating their work to parallel supercomputers such               as Touchstone Delta machine.                                                                                                                                    The principal research issues we plan to address are:                                                                                                           1. Development and analysis of parallel algorithms for film                     processing, multiple small least squares problem, and huge                      (one million plus variables) sparse least squares problems.                     2. Development of data structures suitable for macromolecular                   computations and which can be partitioned for parallel                          methods.                                                                        3. Development of geometric based methods for problem partition                 and mapping computations onto MIMD (Multiple Instruction                        Multiple Data) computers.                                                                                                                                       This work will not only advance the understanding of parallel                   computing but it will also provide a practical tool to enable an                order of magnitude increase in power for the computational                      biology.  We expect this will lead to a qualitative improvement                 in the computational macromolecular biology.",
