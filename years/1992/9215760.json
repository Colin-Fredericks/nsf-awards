 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist from the University of New Mexico.  The student                  will study how Costa Rican peasants defend their agricultural                   practices from environmentalist criticism, at the same time that                the peasants try to insure the continued viability of their                     farming occupations.  Using a mixed methodology of participant                  observation and intensive interviews of a small sample of peasant               households, some more and some less \"environmentalist\", the study               will show how rural farmers use information and rhetoric \"from                  above\" to defend their lifestyles.                                                                                                                              This project is important because environmental concerns must be                adopted by rural as well as urban households if conservation                    policies are to be successful.  This sort of in-depth case study                will provide valuable information on how rural peoples understand               and react to environmentalist arguments, which can help designers               of conservation policies improve their programs.",
