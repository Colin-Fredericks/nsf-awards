 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will address the problem of                     constructing a class of quasi-(translation) invariant probability               measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.  The measures                to be studied are those induced by Hilbert-valued stochastic                    differential equations of elliptic type.  The proposer has                      previously shown such measures to be differentiable, and has also               established a relationship between the properties of measure                    differentiability and quasi-invariance.  He now intends to                      investigate hypotheses which will allow him to combine these                    results, towards the desired end.  The main difficulty is the                   verification of certain regularity properties of the induced                    measures.  He intends to address this problem via a method of                   time-reversal for diffusions.                                                        The principal investigator is studying certain properties of               stochastic differential equations (sde's), a type of equation                   which arises from the dynamics of a physical system which is                    subject to random fluctuations.  (A typical example of such a                   system is the position of an aircraft, whose motion is influenced               by erratic atmospheric conditions.)  Building on some of his                    previous work in this area, the reviewer intends to study the so                called quasi-invariance properties of solutions to sde's.  The                  quasi-invariance problem is related to quantum field theory and                 as such is also of interest to mathematical physicists.",
