 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Christopher M. Hadad has been awarded a Postdoctoral                        Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Hadad's doctoral degree was from                   Yale with Professor Kenneth Wiberg. Dr. Hadad intends to                        continue his research with Professor Charles DePuy at the                       University of Colorado. He will learn the techniques of                         studying reactions by the flowing afterglow method and                          strengthen his understanding of theoretical as well as                          experimental approaches to the elucidation of gas phase                         mechanistic studies. This will help him in his career goal of                   studying how condensed media affects chemical reaction dynamics.                %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                   meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
