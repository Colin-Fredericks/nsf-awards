 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical systems are characterized by very complicated                          dynamics. For example, in a commercial chemical reactor, one                    may face unknown kinetics, multi-phase flow, difficult mass                     and thermal transport and a complex coupling of all these                       mechanisms in an irregular domain.  Therefore, reaction                         engineers have studied idealized problems in the past, with                     the hope of obtaining useful rules of thumb.  Because the                       dynamics of chemical systems are often dominated by only a few                  \"master\" spatial structures, the construction of low                            dimensional, nonlinear dynamic models from purely empirical                     estimations is possible.                                                                                                                                        The PI plans to develop a spatial and temporal correlation                      technique for the identification and construction of canonical                  distributed evolution equations of the master modes.  Because                   such canonical equations contain only a few coefficients,                       general reactor dynamic theory will be developed using                          bifurcation theory to encompass and classify all dynamic                        phenomena in distributed parameter chemical reactors.                           Specifically, reactor responses like growing hot-spots,                         creeping reaction zones, spinning instabilities of propagating                  fronts, etc. will be connected to specific classes of                           distributed disturbances in the theory.  The growth and                         propagation of these instabilities will be mathematically                       delineated in a general reactor stability theory.  Preliminary                  results suggest that the methodology can also be used to                        successfully control reactor dynamics and patterns without an                   explicit model.  The technique permits model updating on-line,                  including adjustments on the order of the model, thus                           overcoming some robustness issues.  Parallel experimental                       studies will be  carried out to confirm the dynamic patterns                    predicted by the theory and to verify the resultant control                     schemes.//",
