The                  long-term goal is to determine how children learn to balance                    their own goals with those of others by observing and                           participating in conflicts that occur in the course of enduring                 relationships.  Specifically, the researcher will extend her own                methodological expertise to expand inquiry in the area of social                conflict and child development.  The PI will learn an established               methodology for observing, coding, and analyzing marital conflict               working with Dr. John Gottman at the University of Washington,                  and adapt it, as necessary, to operationalize the construct of                  \"balancing own and others' goals\".  She will pilot an interview                 protocol for obtaining young children's perceptions of marital                  conflict and develop criteria for coding those perceptions.  When               the piloting process for the child perception measure is                        complete, the PI will collect and compare child perceptions with                the same events as recorded by a trained observer, as well as                   with coding affect and behavior observed when children viewed the               marital conflict.",
