 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Exploratorium seeks support for a program designed to                       help approximately twelve new or expanding U.S. museums                         acquire quality, educationally provern interactive exhibits.                    Over a thirty-six month period, two groups of museums will                      work with the Exploratorium to select and produce an                            individualized set of exhibits.  The museums will dedicate                      staff to participate in the exhibit production process, as                      well as in the development of exhibit-based educational                         programs.  The production cost of the exhibits will be                          shared on a fifty/fifty basis, with NSF's portion being                         matched by funds raised independently by the participating                      museums.  Participant museums will be able to acquire                           stimulating and proven exhibits at half cost, and make use                      of the Exploratorium's exhibit construction shops, staff and                    other resources in developing educational programs and                          materials that complement their chosen exhibit set.  It is                      expected that each participants will receive between                            fourteen and twenty-four exhibits.  The program will repeat,                    to include another six institutions, in the second eighteen                     months.  Participants will select exhibits in an initial one                    week visit to the Exploratorium and then return for a                           minimum four-week period to assist in producing their                           exhibits.  Participation staff, through their involvement                       with construction, will become conversant with their                            exhibits' technical and operational aspects.  The program                       will give participants true hands-on training.  In addition                     to individualized assistance, each participant museum will                      receive publications about exhibit construction and use, as                     well as a booklet that includes technical, maintenance, and                     educational information about their own exhibits.",
