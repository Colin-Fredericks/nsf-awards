 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Summer Science Camp                 offers a five-week summer program at the RIT campus and subsequent              Saturday seminars to extend, enrich and infuse the summer program's             concepts to 50 minority 6th, 7th, and 8th graders with demonstrated             aptitudes for mathematics and science.  Fifty mentors, volunteers from          Eastman Kodak Company, join parents for a parenting skills/career               counseling seminar.  Students, parents, and mentors come together               to assist program staff in attaining the primary goal of guiding                students toward high technology careers.  The SSC campus                        experience provides core discipline courses in mathematics, the                 sciences, engineering, technology and communications.  Through a                multidisciplinary approach with risk-taking, creative thinking, problem         solving, decision making and goal setting, the program builds student           self-confidence, self-esteem, and motivation for academic excellence.           A major research project is required.  Unique features of the SSC's             integrated curriculum include teaching concepts on a need-to-know               basis, which tailors the mathematics content to meet the needs of the           sciences, and in turn, supports the engineering courses.  Concept               reinforcement occurs through field trips and student-mentor                     interaction.",
