 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of work on the development of a                  world-wide system of national accounts.  The present system by                  sponsored by the United Nations is the major source of                          standardized empirical information about prices and quantities of               the economies of nearly all free standing political subdivisions                of the world.  This system of accounts is invaluable for most                   kinds of analysis of individual economies, intertemporally and at               a given point in time, but by itself does not provide a basis for               comparisons across counties.  The major products of this project                are two data sets which are directed at making up for this                      deficiency.  The first of these is a very large table, \"The Penn                World Table,\" which up to now has been presented in five                        successive versions.  The second data set consists of finely                    detailed and integrated bench mark estimates of price parities                  and quantities for 35 summary categories of goods and services                  for about 60 countries for the years 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.                                                                                                This project will update the \"Penn World Table\", by expanding its               county coverage, and filling in data gaps. In addition, it will                 develop estimates of new variables for each country.  The new                   variables are of two types: price parities and outputs of                       disaggregated components of gross domestic product and new                      estimates of purchasing power parities for the production of                    outputs by industry.  In addition, the bench mark studies of the                United Nations International Comparison Program will be reworked                on a data archive of a common vintage and based on a common                     methodology.  These updated and expanded data sets are important                because they provide the basic information needed for research                  aimed at better understanding international trade and economic                  development issues.",
