 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kaveh         This research builds on experience that has been gained  during the construction and calibration of a laboratory  ultrasound-in-air array, in order to establish a systematic  approach for experimentation and theoretical analysis. Optimizing  functionals are being developed for a general class of estimators  with similar computational burden as the well-known method of  MUSIC.  These estimators are expected to significantly reduce the  threshold signal to noise ratio, for a general calibrated array,  over a method such as MUSIC.  Analysis techniques are being  established within a probabilistic framework for comparing the  resolution thresholds of estimators in this class. Detection  methods are also being developed in conjunction with experimental  measurements that make optimum use of the array calibration data.  The new algorithms are being generalized to cases involving  wideband signals and signals possessing special characteristics  such as cyclostationarity. The ongoing experimental work, which  includes the implementation of subspace estimation algorithms on  DSP processors, is intended to establish the level of  practicality of many proposed methods.",
