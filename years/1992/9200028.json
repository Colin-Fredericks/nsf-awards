 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will focus on two aspects of the regulation of               genes for bioluminescence (lux) of Vibrio harveyi:  (1) The control             of expression of lux genes by cell density and other environmental              signals and (2) the mechanism which generates diversity of                      spontaneous variants with different intensities of luminescene.                 The genetic circuitry controlling expression of luminescence                    appears to be complex and to consist of interconnected pathways of              signal transduction which modulate transcription of operon                      (luxC,D,A,B,E) encoding the luminescence enzymes.  At least seven               loci controlling expression of luminescence (luxJ,K,L,M,N,O,R) have             now been identified by a variety of methods in this laboratory.                 These loci are not linked to the operon encoding the luminescence               enzymes and have been cloned for further analysis.  Density-                    dependent regulation is known to involve a pherome-like substance               called autoinducer, and studies are planned to identify those genes             responsible for synthesis and response to this signal molecule as               well as those genes required for the responses to other signals                 such as iron availability.  Specific experiments include:  (1)                  transposon mutagenesis of cloned fragments to localize the lux                  regulatory genes; (2) gene replacement mutagenesis in the native                organism to obtain mutants for characterization of the function of              the regulatory genes; (3) subcloning of lux regulatory genes to                 reassemble control function in recombinant E.coli; (4) construction             of indicator gene fusions and mRNA measurements to define                       regulatory interactions and hierarchical control relationships; (5)             DNA sequencing to analyze the structure of the regulatory proteins              and the cis-acting control regions; and (6) genome structure                    probing with cloned lux genes to detect and characterize DNA                    rearrangements thought to cause variation in luminescence                       phenotypes.  Genetic analysis of luminescence regulation should                 yield insight into mechanisms bacteria use to perceive and react to             their environment, and analysis of variation should reveal                      mechanisms for creating the genetic diversity needed for adaption               to varied and changing circumstances.",
