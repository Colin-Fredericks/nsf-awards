 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Topp of the University of                 Pennsylvania  will use picosecond-resolution polarization                       spectroscopy in cooled jet expansions to study structure and                    dynamics in molecular clusters.  Using the time-domain                          rotational coherence technique, Topp proposes to obtain                         structural information on clusters in order to understand                       energy transfer and related processes in these organized                        systems.  Such information is difficult to obtain by more                       normal frequency resolved spectroscopic techniques.  The                        aromatic molecule perylene will be used in much of the                          structural work, involving the complexation of different                        alkanes and various polar and unsaturated molecules with large                  electrostatic interactions.                                                     %%%                                                                             The nucleation of small clusters of atoms or molecules by large                 organic molecules which absorb and emit visible light presents                  valuable opportunities to study intermolecular forces of the                    kind found on a larger scale in solutions and in the adsorption                 of molecules onto extended surfaces.  Lasers can be used to                     excite these large organic molecules, and then the time                         evolution of the associated cluster can be followed on very                     fast time scales in order to be able to determine the structure                 and dynamics of these microscopic organized systems.  Such                      information can have a bearing on many fields, including                        catalysis and the chemistry of life processes.",
