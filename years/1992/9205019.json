 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bacterial reaction center (RC) is the membrane bound pigment-               protein complex within which light energy is converted into                     chemical energy.  This photoconversion process occurs via a                     series of fast and highly specific electron transfer reactions                  that separate charge across the RC (and thus across the                         membrane) with unity quantum yield.  The ultimate goal of this                  work is to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of this                      process at a molecular level.  To this end, transient absorption                spectroscopic measurements spanning the femtosecond to                          millisecond timescales as well as other spectroscopic studies                   will be carried out to directly identify and study the                          intermediate states of charge separation and the rates and yields               of their formation and decay.  These studies will be carried out                on both wild-type RCs and a wide variety of mutant RCs in which                 one or more amino acids are changed.  Numerous unresolved issues                regarding the involvement of specific chromophores in the pathway               of electron transfer, and the selectivity (or directionality) of                these reactions will be addressed.  Factors underlying the                      balancing of the competition between the forward electron                       transfer reactions and the deactivating (or back) reactions will                be investigated.  These studies will also address the role of the               protein in the charge separation process, both at the level of                  specific amino acids and at a more global level.  The results of                this work will be compared with predictions from various                        theoretical models for electron transfer and, indeed, will likely               form the basis for further theoretical developments.                            %%%                                                                             The conversion of light energy into chemical energy is essential                for life on earth.  Detailed studies of the mechanism of this                   energy conversion process are essential not only for increasing                 the understanding of one of the most important biological                       processes, but also as a foundation for devising biomimetic systems             for solar energy conversion.  The proposed studies will provide                 diverse information that is critical for elucidating the                        molecular mechanisms by which the reaction center functions.  The               studies also will advance knowledge of the factors that control                 electron transfer, which is one of the most fundamental processes               in biology and chemistry.  Additionally, the research will                      provide detailed new information on the effects of pigment-                     protein interactions and protein dynamics on the energetics,                    rates and mechanisms of biological processes.  Hence, the                       proposed research should have a very positive impact on our                     fundamental understanding of photosynthesis and on the applied                  aspects of photosynthetic energy conversion.",
