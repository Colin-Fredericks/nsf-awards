 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a workshop on Integrated Regional Models              (IRM) for analysis of human-nature interactions.  Integrated                    regional models are conceptual and mathematically based models that             include within the structure of the model mathematical descriptions             of the physical environment, biological interactions, and human                 decision making and its consequences.  Despite concerns about                   \"global\" change, many key scientific and policy issues in the                   environment are developed, considered and ultimately implemented on             regional scales - local jurisdictions, watersheds, agricultural                 production regions.  At these scales, regional interactions of                  physical, biological and social systems play a critical role in                 defining the problems that must be resolved.                                                                                                                    Environmental issues which require an integrated analysis include               coastal zone management, regional atmospheric chemistry and                     pollution, non-point source pollution, commodity production in                  forested landscapes, and urban growth.  Progress on coupling models             from physical, biological and social sciences has been limited by               lack of interactions between disciplines, differences in technical              approaches, and the absence of appropriate interdisciplinary data               sets.  The objective of the workshop will be to provide a forum for             scientists from different disciplines to learn about the state of               knowledge and models in other disciplines, and to explore ways that             scientists from different disciplines can work together on the same             problems.  Further, the workshop will identify specific steps and               data requirements necessary for the development of IRM's for                    specific environmental problems.  The workshop will open with paired            overviews of physical, biological and social science models by                  scientists from both within and outside of each discipline.  The                workshop will then move on to group discussions of specific problems            requiring IRM's, and finally to group discussions of specific                   regions and how differences in physical, biological and social                  variables in different regions will affect the development of IRM's.            Workshop participants will be evenly divided between physical,                  social, biological and integrative disciplines, and will include                scientists from several countries.",
