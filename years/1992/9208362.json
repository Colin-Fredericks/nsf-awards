 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detailed investigation of morphologically and anatomically                 preserved Early Devonian plant taxa referable to trimerophytes or               of problematical affinities is proposed.  Characters useful in                  determining their possible relationships to major pteridophyte                  groups, refining taxonomic circumscriptions, and postulation                    patterns of divergence of structures or lineages should result.                 Specific projects include study of Psilophyton and Pertica-                     related plants from Canada and Germany in order to better                       characterize the trimerophytes and to develop hypotheses of                     phylogenetic relationships with other plant groups.  Taeniocrad-                type axes will be examined to determine number of taxa                          represented and to evaluate their relationships.  Additional                    information about morphology and affinities of remains similar to               the putative gameotophyte Caliculiphyton will be obtained.                      Several zosterophyll types continue to be studied for the purpose               of better evaluating generic and species relationships.  A                      variety of techniques, including degagement, maceration in acids,               thin-sectioning, SEM observation, whole plant reconstruction,                   hypotheses of homology of structures, and phylogenetic analytical               methods will be employed as appropriate.  This research will                    expand and improve the array of characters useful in phylogenetic               and evolutionary analyses, generate new hypotheses of                           relationships of some lineages, and contribute new information                  about the composition and diversity of early Devonian floras of                 southeastern Canada.",
