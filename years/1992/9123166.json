 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of recovering an input signal from a blurred                   output, in an input-output system with linear distortion, is                    ubiquitous in science and technology.  When the blurred output is               not corrupted by statistical noise, the problem is entirely                     deterministic and amounts to a mathematical inversion of a linear               system with positive parameters, subject to positivity con-                     straints on the solution.  By showing that all such linear                      inverse problems with positivity constraints can be interpreted                 as statistical estimation problems, extremely simple algorithms                 can be developed for finding the problems' maximum likelihood                   solutions.  Extensions to specific problems like noise degrada-                 tion,  estimation of blurring parameters (parameters of the point               spread function) and regularization techniques will follow.  The                methodology will be applied to new problems including restoration               of images blurred by relative motion between the subject and the                camera lens.                                                                         The blurring of a signal (sound, image, etc.) is common in                 science and technology, for example the systematic distort                      observed signal becomes what mathematicians call linear inverse                 problems with positivity constraints.  This research will develop               methods of solution which are broadly applicable to such                        problems.  The basis for this approach is to draw on statistical                principles and exploit the connection between such linear inverse               problems and statistical estimation problems for incomplete data                where methods already exist.",
