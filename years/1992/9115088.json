 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop organized by                                 Professor Chaim Poran of the University of North                                Carolina, Charlotte, in collaboration with Professor                            E. Retamal of the Institute for Research and Testing                            of Materials (IDIEM) at the University of Chile.  The                           aim of the workshop is to assemble U.S. and Chilean                             experts in geotechnical earthquake engineering and                              strong ground motion, in order to review critically                             the geotechnical instrumentation and associated                                 research needs for seismic hazard research in Chile.                                                                                                            The workshop aims to examine the risk of damage and                             loss of life associated with facilities in Chile,                               which are constructed in highly seismic environments.                           It will also focus on the urgent need for geotechnical                          instrumentation and research in populated areas and at                          sites planned for development.  The Chileans will                               benefit from U.S. expertise in this field.  The U.S.                            side will gain an opportunity to apply lessons learned                          in Chile to promote earthquake hazard reduction                                 efforts in the United States.",
