 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital image processing offers several possible new                            approaches to the teaching of a variety of mathematical                         concepts at the middle-school and high-school levels.  There                    is reason to believe that this approach will be successful                      in reaching some \"at-risk\" students that other approaches                       miss.  Since digital images can be made to reflect almost                       any aspect of the real world, some students may have an                         easier time taking an interest in them than they might with                     artificial figures or images resulting from other graphics-                     oriented approaches.  Using computer-based tools such as                        image processing operators, curve-fitting operators, shape                      analysis operators, and graphical synthesis, students may                       explore a world of mathematical concepts starting from the                      psychologically \"safe\" territory of their own physical and                      cultural environments.  There is reason to hope that this                       approach will be particularly successful with students from                     diverse backgrounds, girls and members of minority groups,                      because the imagery used in experiments can easily be                           tailored to individual tastes.  The work of the project                         consists of creating detailed designs of the learning                           modules, implementing them on microcomputers, and evaluating                    their effectiveness in a variety of ways, using trials with                     students at Rainier Beach High School, which is an urban                        public high school having an ethnically diverse student body                    and a Macintosh computer laboratory.",
