 "awd_abstract_narration": "Starving bacteria are important ecologically, in biotechnology, and             as models of biological differentiation.  Upon starvation, the non-             sporeforming bacterium Escherichia coli differentiates into                     markedly resistant cells by expressing some 50 genes in early                   starvation.  The KatF protein, which is believed to be a novel                  sigma factor, is required for the synthesis of several of these                 proteins, since defect in the katF gene substantially prevents                  starvation protein induction and resistance development.  This                  finding suggests but does not prove the involvement of KatF-                    regulated starvation proteins in the development of cellular                    resistant state.  Direct evidence will be sought for this role. A               katF deletion strain will be constructed.  A drug resistance marker             will be inserted into the cloned katF gene which will be crossed                into the E. coli chromosome, using a recB recC sbcB strain,                     followed by transfer of the mutated gene into the wild type                     background.  The katF structural gene under the control of a                    titratable promoter will be introduced into the deletion strain.                Different amounts of KatF will be produced during starvation, and               correlation to the degree of resistance to starvation, oxidative,               heat and osmotic stresses will be determined.  Two-dimensional                  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns will be determined in               selected instances.  This may shed light on which protein spots are             especially important in the development of starvation and other                 resistances.  Similiar experiments will be done during exponential              phase of growth to see if overproduction of KatF can confer                     resistance during growth as well.  There is evidence that KatF                  synthesis may be regulated at the postranscriptional level.  To                 explore this, transcriptional and tranlational fusions of katF to               lacZ will be constructed using the polymerase chain reaction                    technology.                                                                     %%%                                                                             Bacteria in nature exist primarily in a starving state.  What                   biochemical characters are expressed under starvation conditions                and how this expression is regulated are therefore important in the             understanding of bacterial activities in nature which include                   besides disease causation, recycling of elements and environmental              detoxification.  Starving bacteria are also important in microbial              based industrial fermentations because their use permits rapid and              cheap biotransformations using special bioreactors.  Some fifty new             genes are expressed by Escherichia coli when this bacterium is                  starved.  A subset of these may be concerned with synthesis of                  proteins that make the cells more resistant to many different kinds             of stresses.  How might these proteins make cells more resistant to             stresses is an important biological question which can be                       conveniently explored in this model system.  In this proposal, the              aim is to clearly determine if a specific subset of starvation                  proteins is involved in stress resistance.  This subset is                      controlled by a novel genetic element called KatF.  By using                    techniques of molecular biology, the amount of KatF in the cells                will be precisely regulated, the concentration of the proteins it               regulates will be qunatified, and a determination will be made of               whether their concentration correlates with the degree of                       resistance acquired by the cells.  Identification of proteins that              determine the cellular resistant state can make it possible to                  manipulate cellular resistance; and an insight into their                       biochemical role can provide information about fundamental cellular             functions.",
