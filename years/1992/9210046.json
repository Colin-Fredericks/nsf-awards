 "awd_abstract_narration": "The optics of the eye focus an image of the world onto the retina               which contains four types of photoreceptors: blue, green and red                cones and a single type of rod.  Experiments are being conducted to             learn how the signals from the three cone photoreceptor types of the            retina are organized and how the information about color is                     organized and processed by the early stages of the visual system.                                                                                               Conventional wisdom holds that information from photoreceptors is               transmitted by two main visual pathways in the brain:  one is                   sluggish and transmits information about color; the other is rapid              and transmits information about intensity.  The specific studies                being conducted in this research project use flickering light of                different colors and flicker interactions to address specific                   questions about the nature of these two visual pathways, as well as             how their signals change when the visual system adapts to                       increasingly intense lights.  This research is providing clear                  evidence that the early stages of the visual system are more complex            than the prevailing psychophysical models suggest.",
