 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate measurements of temperature and species                                concentrations are important for characterization of high                       temperature gas flows, particularly in the area of combustion.                  Optical measurements are desirable since they are                               nonintrusive, nonperturbing, and the probe is not subject to a                  hostile environment.  An absorption measurement provides a                      simple quantitative definition of the concentration of the                      absorbing specie along a line-of-sight; this is sometimes                       adequate information, but more often spatially resolved                         measurements are needed.  In principle, two-dimensional                         temperature and concentration fields should be recoverable                      from a limited number of line-of-sight measurements using                       tomographic reconstruction, a method widely used in medical                     imaging.  However, accurate quantitative reconstructions of                     temperature and concentration fields have been difficult to                     achieve because reconstruction algorithms are very sensitive                    to errors in the input data.  The principal objective of this                   program is to measure temperature and concentration fields                      simultaneously using a reconstruction technique that exploits                   the tuning capability of infrared diode lasers to greatly                       reduce the sensitivity of the reconstruction methods to both                    random and systematic errors in the input data.  The study                      will begin with reconstruction of radial temperature and                        concentration profiles (CO and CO2) in an axisymmetric flow,                    with subsequent extension of the procedures to reconstruction                   of two-dimensional sections of three-dimensional flows.                                                                                                         The application of quantitative laser diagnostics to                            industrial scenarios has been hampered by the typical high                      cost of equipment involved and by the user sophistication                       required for achievement of quantitative results.  Success                      with the these lower-cost, more user-friendly systems may well                  lead to wider usage in industry; the software and hardware                      developed should enable implementation of tomographic                           absorption diagnostic techniques in a wide variety of                           applications.  Potentially, further development of this                         technology, with use of inexpensive laser diode sources, may                    allow instrumentation packages cheap and robust enough for use                  in in-plant process control systems.",
