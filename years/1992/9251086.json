 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to improve the learning,                       retention, and application of physics concepts and principles                   by students enrolled in physics classes at Lee College.  This                   is being accomplished by introducing a series of new                            experiences in the laboratory utilizing microcomputer-based                     laboratories, activities, and new experiments in mechanics.                     These laboratory experiences are in the areas of kinematics,                    forces, rotational motion, energy, and simple harmonic motion.                  Using some of the MBL results of Thornton and Laws with some                    results done at Lee College, a new laboratory curriculum is                     being developed that is integrating new technologies with                       proven activities and experiments.  Microcomputers are being                    used to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing; and                    are being used to construct, execute, and display physical                      simulations in mechanics.The support is provided for software                   and hardware for six, networked, color Macintosh IIsi                           workstations equipped with a Universal Lab Interface with                       appropriate sensors and probes. Support is also provided for a                  laser printer, CD reader, scanner, and some laboratory                          equipment.This project is encouraging students to continue                      study in physics or to support science by improving their                       experiences in physics, to increase science literacy, to help                   prepare Lee College's physics courses for the next century, and                 to stimulate other two-year and four-year colleges to adapt                     this approach for their needs.",
