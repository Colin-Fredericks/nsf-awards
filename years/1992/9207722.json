 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recently developed class of models demonstrate that local                     population dynamics can be influenced by processes that operate                 between spatially separated sub-populations.  In theory these                   models are directly applicable not only to understanding large-                 scale patterns of abundance but in evaluating the degree to which               habitat fragmentation/patchiness affects species of concern.                    Critical factors in gauging species responses to habitat                        patchiness are:  i) dispersal ability relative to patch isolation               and dispersion; and ii) patch differences in social structure                   that determine whether individual patches are net producers or                  consumers of immigrants.  Few studies, however, have examined the               importance of these factors to field populations.  Here we                      propose to study the responses of two small mammal species to an                experimentally created landscape of habitat patches distributed                 over a 36 ha area.  Sub-populations within the fragmented system                would be compared to that in a continuous (unfragmented) habitat                control.  Objectives include examination of the interplay between               patch size, animal dispersal ability, and how these affect--and                 are affected by--patch to patch variation in population                         structure.  This system will serve as an empirical model for                    studying the importance of dispersal to populations inhabiting                  heterogeneous habitats, patches, and /or habitats that are                      threatened with fragmentation.",
