 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research entails a hierarchy of numerical modeling                    studies designed to investigate fundamental dynamics of the upper               ocean circulation in 3 regimes: the equatorial, coastal and                     subtropical oceans.  The primary model to be used in this                       research is a nonlinear, 2 1/2-layer dynamic/thermodynamic ocean                model which allows exchange of water between the 2 active layers.               The study tasks are either continuations, or natural extensions, of             work currently being funded by NSF (8817026 and 8912015).  There                are two unifying themes for much of the research: (1) understanding             the dynamics of a new type of frontal instability, and (2)                      exploring the sensitivity of solutions to the parameterization of               entrainment and detrainment physics.                                            %%%                                                                                  The study contains research components that are directly                   applicable to all oceans, and research components that are more                 applicable to specific oceans.  The research components directly                applicable to all oceans are: (1) the investigation of the                      variability associated with equatorial currents, coastal currents               and small-scale oceanic fronts, and (2) the study of interactions               between the equatorial, coastal and subtropical ocean circulations.              The research components more applicable to specific oceans are:                (1) the study of the driving mechanisms of various flow patterns in             the Indian Ocean, particularly in the Bay of Bengal, along the                  coasts of India, and near the equator, (2) the study of the New                 Guinea Coastal Undercurrent in the Pacific Ocean.",
