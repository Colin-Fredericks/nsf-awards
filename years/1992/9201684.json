 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal grant jointly funded by the Divisions of                      Materials Research and Chemistry.  The theoretical project focuses              on the role of disorder on the transport and spin properties of                 granular metals and conducting polymers.  The work on granular                  metals represents a new thrust to this ongoing project.  Impurity               band and scaling arguments are proposed to explain the                          experimentally observed conductivity in granular metals.  It is                 shown how the impurity band model for granular metals can be                    applied to conducting polymer polyaniline.  In addition, an                     interacting electron model is used to explain the magnetic                      properties of polyaniline.  Studies will be conducted on                        polyacetylene and the role of structural disorder on the insulator-             metal transition.  Finally, a study of the crossover from two- to               one-dimensional dynamics in the polymer poly-pyrolle perchlorate                will be undertaken.                                                             %%%                                                                             In real materials disorder manifests itself through impurities or               the misplacement of atoms or molecules in an otherwise perfect                  crystal or chemical structure.  This disorder can have profound                 effects on the properties of materials.  The understanding of                   various types of disorder and its influence on materials represents             a major challenge to materials scientists.  The proposed research               will study a novel approach to the effects of disorder on two types             of systems:  conducting polymers and granular metals.  Both of                  these materials have important applications and pose formidable                 theoretical difficulties.",
