 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is directed towards improved understanding of             first-order phase transformations based on examination of the                   martensitic phase transformation.  The program employs both                     theoretical and experimental approaches to address two broad areas:             (a) the distributed-activation kinetics of heterogeneous                        nucleation; and (b) competing transformation mechanisms in                      nonlinear nonlocal solids.  General features of distributed-                    activation heterogeneous kinetics are examined in nucleation                    kinetic experiments employing acoustic emission and sterological                measurements in both thermoelastic and nonthermoelastic martensitic             systems, defining potency distributions of initial and                          autocatalytic defects.  principles are extended to bainitic                     transformations and solidification.  Competing mechanisms of                    structural transformation are examined by combined theory and                   experiment in model systems describable by nonlinear nonlocal                   continuum models predicting interfacial energies.  Experiments test             predicted behavior of a new transformation mechanism,                           quasimartensitic strain modulation, which competes with nucleation              and growth under conditions near a lattice instability.                         %%%                                                                             This analytical and experimental work is directed to martensitic                transformations found in steels, for instance, but is applicable to             other phase transformations in metals and ceramics.",
