 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is intended to evaluate, analyze and design a                completely novel approach to configuring Computer Numeric Control               (CNC) metal-cutting machine tools.  Traditional CNC machines are                primarily configured as a set of mutually perpendicular linear axes             and cutting tool paths are generated by the interpolation of these              linear axes, to cut the variety of shapes hat have to be                        manufactured.  In this approach the machine tool consists of only               rotary axes and all the variety of tool paths that need to be                   generated will result from their interpolation.  The benefits of                configuring the machine in this manner are well established but                 complex and significant control issues need to be evaluated and                 addressed in order to establish the feasibility of this approach.                    The success of this program, which is being jointly funded by              a quasi-industry organization, could lead to minor revolution in                the way conventional machine tools are configured and potentially               provide the domestic industry an opportunity to exploit.",
