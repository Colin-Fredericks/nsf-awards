 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an increasingly interdependent world, current social, economic,              and technical changes are weakening, blurring, or eliminating                   legal, spacial and temporal borders.  In recent years, there has                been an acceleration of the internationalization of crime and                   mechanisms for its control.  Yet, little is known about the social              structures and processes involved in law enforcement across                     international borders.                                                                                                                                          This project focuses on the organizational dynamics, interactions,              and dependencies involved in international policing.  Systematic                studies will be conducted in cooperation with European scholars in              England, Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.  Rather                 than taking the nation-state as the static unit of analysis, the                project focuses on dynamic interdependencies involving                          organizational behavior, and process aspects of cross-national                  policing.  The six case studies involve (1) new cross-border                    policing organizations and the weakening of borders; (2) the                    import-export of democratic policing; (3) social control technology             across borders; (4) legal mobilization such as enforcing EEC rules              against fraud; (5) private police organizations across borders; (6)             order-maintenance and international groups.  The methods of                     investigation involve observation, interviews, and the analysis of              documentary data in all of the countries involved.  Through these               studies, concepts and hypotheses required for understanding cross-              border policing will be developed.                                                                                                                              This project has considerable potential to yield knowledge about                the organizational, behavioral, and process aspects of formal                   social control systems and the structure of nation-states                       themselves as they change and adapt to an increasingly global                   context.  Not only can awareness of cross-border influences help                in understanding the dynamic nature of crime and enforcement                    patterns, but also the research will call attention to the systemic             aspects of many forms of law-related behavior across juridical                  borders.",
