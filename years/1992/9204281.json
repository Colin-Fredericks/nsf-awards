The symposium                 will include three sessions and will last one and one half                      days.  Eighteen leading research have been invited to review                    their past and present their current research on the Beta-                      glucosidase they are studying.  Topics will include (1) the                     purification and characterization of Beta-glucosidases from                     plants, humans, insects, fungi, and bacteria; (2) the mechanism                 of catalysis: (3) isolation, characterization, and manipulation                 of Beta-glucosidase genes: and (4) use of Beta-glucosidases for                 biomass conversion in industry.  Symposium papers will be                       collected into a book to be published by the American Chemical                  Society Books Department.                                                       %%%                                                                             Current research on Beta glucosidases has significant                           scientific and economic implications.  Plant enzymes are                        implicated in growth productivity, food and feed toxicities,                    fungal and bacterial enzymes could be used in the industrial                    conversion of cellulose to glucose; and human enzyme deficiency                 is the cause of Gaucher's disease.",
