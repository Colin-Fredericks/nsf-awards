 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of the proposed research is to determine the role             of dichogamy (temporal separation between male and female flowers),             and herkogamy (spatial separation between male and female flowers)              in promoting matings among individuals and/or preventing                        interference between male and female function both within and                   between flowers on individual plants.  Dichogamy and herkogamy are              widespread among angiosperms and are often found together; however,             little is known about the precise role each contributes to an                   individual's reproductive success.  The proposed study organism,                hermaphroditic Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae), is self-                       compatible, dichogamous and herkogamous.  The role of dichogamy and             herkogamy in influencing an individuals fitness will be quantified              using chimeric plants when dichomgamy and herkogamy are (1) both                functioning, (2) only one is functioning, and (3) neither is                    functioning .  The role of dichogamy and herkogamy will also be                 examined as a function of flower age, size of floral display (in                promoting self-pollinations between flowers on the same plant), and             plant density.  Pollen donors will be exactly determined using                  experimental plant arrays of unique genotypes known from allozyme               markers.  Male function will be determined by measuring pollen                  production, pollen removal rates and siring ability via allozyme                markers in the same experimental plant arrays.  Female function                 will be estimated by quantifying pollen deposition onto stigmas and             seed set per fruit.  These studies explore basic aspects of plant               pollination and reproduction.",
