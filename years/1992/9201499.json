 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread existence of teleplanic or \"long distance\" larvae                of sublittoral invertebrates in the tropical epipelagic waters of               the central Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans supports the                    hypothesis that larvae contribute importantly not only to initial               colonization of oceanic islands and, more generally, to the                     present continuous or disjunct ranges of such species, but also                 to the continuing genetic exchange among islands or even between                islands and far distant continental populations.  However, no one               has yet demonstrated in any systematic way that teleplanic larvae               are capable of metamorphosing at the time of their collection in                the open sea.  We do not yet know whether teleplanic larvae are                 physiologically adapted for remaining planktonic over long                      periods of time or whether the lack of further growth already                   documented instead is due to low phytoplankton concentrations in                the open ocean. The future research will address these two                      questions 1) by obtaining larvae in the open ocean and ascertain                experimentally whether or not these larvae are competent to                     metamorphose, (2) by maintaining larvae in the laboratory to                    determine whether individuals that would not metamorphose in the                sea eventually become competent to metamorphose, and 3) by                      determining whether or not teleplanic larvae are physiologically                capable of further growth given adequate phytoplankton                          concentrations or alternatively whether growth stasis, i.e., a                  quasi-holoplanktonic state, is achieved.",
