 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are large, reliable differences in probability judgments                  made by individuals in Western countries like the United States                 and those in many Asian countries.  Most differences pertain                    to calibration.  (Good calibration exists, for example, if about                40% of the events that are assigned probability judgments of 40%                actually happen.)  However, differences in discrimination have                  been documented, too.  (Discrimination is the ability of                        judgments to sharply distinguish instances when a target event                  will occur from those when it will not.)  Several potential                     explanations of the observed differences will be tested with                    subjects in the United States and several Asian locations.  The                 major research hypothesis is that the variations rest on cognitive              processing habits rooted in different cultural traditions,                      including ones pertaining to social interactions.  Another                      proposition is that the differences are an artifact of previous                 researchers' sampling of judgment tasks.  According to a third                  explanation, the distinctions are specific to particular judgment               topics and to student subjects.  A final explanation says that                  the differences reflect cross-national variations in the relative               importance of various aspects of judgment quality.  This research               promises insights into universal judgment mechanisms as well as                 ones peculiar to given cultures.  It should also provide guidance               about problems in cross-national communication and collaboration                and for improving decision technologies and their transferability.",
