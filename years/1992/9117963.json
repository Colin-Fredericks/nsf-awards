 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seasonal cycles of reproduction and development are very common in              a wide variety of animals that utlize the length of the day as a                cue to asses the time of year. The research proposed is directed                toward understanding the mechanism by which daylength (or                       photoperiod) is measured. Previous studies have led to the                      hypothesis regulates the biological clock that regulates daily                  (i.e., circadian) rhythms of behavior and metabolism is involved                in photoperiodic time measurement. We plan to directly test that                hypothesis utilizing and insect, the cricket, Gryllus firmus, as                a model system. There are two specific goals of the research                    program. The first is to confirm that the \"circadian clock\" is in               fact a component of the \"photoperiodic clock\" that regulates                    seasonal rhythms. The second is to initiate studies to determine                the precise role of the circadian clock in carrying otu the                     measurement of daylength. Gryllus Firmus females lay eggs that                  either develop immediately or enter a state of developmental                    arrest. If the adult female is maintained in long, summer-like days             (e.g., 14 h of light per day) then the egge develop, but if the                 females ismaintained in short, winter-like days the eggs undergo                developmentyal arrest for over-wintering. We plan to characterize               the anatomical and physiological organization of the circadian                  system thaty regualtes daily rhythms of locomototr activity, and                examine the specific role played  by the circadian system in                    photoperiodic time measurement.",
