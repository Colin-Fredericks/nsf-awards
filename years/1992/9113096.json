 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gauging the extent of human genetic diversity has long been one of              the goals of physical anthropology.  During the 1960s and 1970s                 tens of thousands of blood (and other tissue) samples were gathered             by geneticists and physical anthropologists from a wide variety of              native peoples.  At the time, most research on genetic variability              centered on the red cell enzymes and to a lesser extent serum                   proteins.  The nucleated white cells were viewed as useless and                 generally discarded.  With them however, information at the DNA                 level was discarded, which could now be very useful given modern                molecular biological techniques.   Stoneking and Weiss propose to               develop techniques, largely relying on a new technique called PCR,              to generate data at the genetic level from the few remaining white              cells which each sample likely contains.  Given that there are                  still tens of thousands of red cell samples in freezer around the               world, large amounts of information on genetic variability may be               unlocked if they are successful.  This is an especially important               project as many of the human groups are rapidly disappearing as                 genetic and cultural entities.",
