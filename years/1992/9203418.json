 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop controller design procedures for                  repetitive control systems that relate controller design to                     specified levels of performance of the system. Procedures will be               developed for the simplified case of repetitive controllers with                large time delay values as well as the more general case where                  the time delay values are not large. The controller design                      procedure will be based on H infinity control theory and robust                 performance will be sought. Available theory for H infinity                     control of distributed parameter systems will be modified and                   applied to repetitive control systems. Currently available                      repetitive controllers will also be viewed in an H infinity                     framework so that the relationship of weights used in the H                     infinity problem and the resulting controller is better                         understood. It is expected that the H infinity repetitive                       controllers designed using this approach will perform at least as               well as currently available repetitive controllers. Usefulness of               the controller design procedures developed here and of the                      controllers themselves will be established by application to                    closed loop servohydraulic testing. The use of servohydraulic                   actuators raises considerations of actuator-related                             nonlinearities which are specific to this application. These                    nonlinear effects will be characterized as model error, in terns                compatible with the H infinity  controller design procedure.                    Furthermore, the stability of repetitive control systems with                   these nonlinear effects will be evaluated by appropriate                        stability analysis techniques.***  //",
