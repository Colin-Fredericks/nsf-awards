 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Eric L. Johnson of Central                        Michigan University to collaborate in geological research with                  Professor Neil Mancktelow of the Geological Institute of the                    Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich.  The objective                   of their research is to gain a better understanding of the                      relationships between the microstructural development of a                      quartz-rich rock and the fluid contained in that rock.  They                    will carry out a systematic study of the interaction of grain                   boundary fluids and fluid inclusions during the progressive                     deformation of quartz-dominated rocks and veins from the                        Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ) in southwestern Switzerland and                        northern Italy.  Their research objective requires an                           interdisciplinary approach which is well served by their                        complementary expertise in structural geology (Mancktelow) and                  metamorphic petrology (Johnson.)  The SFZ is an ideal natural                   laboratory for the proposed research since it contains an                       unusually wide range of rock deformation types that have                        already been quantitatively studied by Mancktelow.                                                                                                              The use of fluid inclusion data from naturally deformed rocks                   is complicated by the unknown effects of deformation on the                     compositions and densities of fluid inclusions.  During                         deformation, the modification, genesis, and annihilation of                     fluid inclusions is intimately tied to the formation and                        migration of grain boundaries and the distribution,                             composition and physical properties of the grain boundary                       fluid(s).  The observations and models to be obtained in this                   international collaborative project will provide a basis for                    the meaningful use of fluid inclusion data from deformed                        rocks.",
