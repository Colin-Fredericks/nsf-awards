 "awd_abstract_narration": "At a recent Microelectronics and Information Processing Systems                 (MIPS) Advisory Committee meeting, it was recommended that a Signal             Processing Workshop be held to meet several goals.  The Division                Director of MIPS pointed out to the Advisory Committee that NSF                 needed help from the research community in developing both a short              term and a long term vision for the area of signal processing.  The             short term vision would identify promising areas of research having             high pay-offs in terms of research results and industrial                       relevances.  The long term vision would examine general trends in               signal processing, and determine if investments should be made in               these areas.  This proposal is designed to address the above needs.              A side benefit will be to introduce the new Circuits and Signal                Processing Program Director to key people in a broad range of areas             of signal processing.",
