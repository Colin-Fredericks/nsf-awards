 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor James E. Johnson at Texas Woman's University.  The                 role of stereoelectronic effects in nucleophilic substitution                   reactions at the carbon-nitrogen double bond will be explored.                  Geometric isomers of imines will be synthesized, the rates of                   their reactions with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles will be                   measured, and the structures of the products will be                            determined.  The specific studies that will be undertaken                       include: (1) nucleophilic substitution on cyclic hydroximates                   and hydroximoyl chlorides; (2) methoxide ion substitution on                    the Z and E isomers of n-propyl O-methylethoxy                                  formohydroximate; (3) amine substitution in the Z and E isomers                 of hydroximoyl chlorides, and (4) hydrolysis of the Z and E                     isomers of a hydroximoyl tosylate and/or a hydroximoyl bromide.                 %%%                                                                             The rates of reaction of several substrates that different in                   the arrangement of their atoms in space will be measured.                       Differences in reactivity and in the structures of the products                 will allow assessment of the effect of nonbonding electrons on                  the course of the reaction.  The results of this study will                     contribute to an improved understanding of reactions of organic                 compounds which contain nitrogen atoms.",
