 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores sensor-based control of a mechanical snake               through development of obstacle-avoidance and motion-planning                   algorithms.  The mechanical snake is robot-like mechanism, a                    prototype of which is now being tested in the laboratory.  It                   consists of a sensorized head link (that detects obstacles) and                 six identical regular links (that provide motion).  As an                       obstacle is detected, the computer in the head link will be able                to recommend a motion of each link so that when that link arrives               in the neighborhood of the obstacle it will not collide with it.                Developing the algorithms to make this system work is a far more                challenging problem than the state-of-the-art, real-time                        collision avoidance strategies currently in use for mobile robots               and robot arms.  When completed, the snake will be able to move                 into areas that people cannot enter (e.g., small cracks in                      collapsed highway after an earthquake) or are too dangerous for                 people (e.g., a radioactive environment).  At these locations,                  the will perform surveillance (e.g., look for survivors through                 remote video, check radioactivity levels) or a task (e.g., bring                medicine to survivors).",
