 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an instructional                       module for first-year college, and senior high school, students                 that uses a stimulating video, subsequent role playing, and                     class projects.  The module uses advanced technology to deliver                 the following messages:  (1) Careers in engineering are                         important, well respected, intellectually challenging,                          creative, and socially responsible.  (2) Engineering is not                     just a \"man's\" profession.  (3) It is important for everyone to                 be technologically literate.  An Advisory Board is being formed                 to review and revise the development of the material.  A script                 is being developed for the video material, and a team of                        university and high school teachers and students is writing                     instructional materials.  Plans will be developed to produce                    the video material and to test the module in introductory                       engineering courses at two universities and in a special course                 on the Principles of Engineering at selected high schools in                    New York State.",
