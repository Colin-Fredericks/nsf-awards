 "awd_abstract_narration": "The perception of pain requires excitatory synaptic transmission                from primary afferent sensory fibers to secondary projection                    neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  Two groups of                   neurotransmitter candidates are thought to mediate this initial                 excitatory step in the pain pathway: one being excitatory amino                 acids (EAA:  glutamate, asparate), and another are peptides                     (including tachykinins such as substance P and neurokinin A).                   These peptides may be colocalized with an excitatory amino acid(s)              in the same neurons.  Chemical signal transfer via such neurons                 presents new aspects and complexities of presynaptic (synaptic                  efficacy) and postsynaptic (membrane excitability) regulation which             have not previously been considered and may have important                      implications for the performance of the somatosensory, especially               of pain pathways.  Dr. Randic has recently found that substance P               and excitatory amino acids interact to produce neurophysiological               signs of hyperalgesia i.e. a prolonged enhancement of responses to              excitatory manipulation.  However, the sites and the molecular                  mechanisms by which the peptide signals produce enhanced EAA                    responses have yet to be elucidated.  Dr. Randic will examine the               hypothesis that the activation of distinct neurokinin receptors                 causes modulation of the responses of freshly isolated spinal                   dorsal horn neurons to EAAs, especially to N-methyl-D-aspartic-                 acid (NMDA).  To gain understanding of molecular mechanism(s)                   underlying interactions between EAAs, and tachykinins possible                  involvement of glycine allosteric site of NMDA receptor channel                 complex, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) or change             in Ca++-sensitive second messenger systems, will be investigated.               Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of EAA responses will be                     utilized in this study.  Delineating the cellular mechanism(s) of               peptide actions on dorsal horn neurons is an important step toward              understanding anatomical and neurochemical organization of the                  spinal dorsal horn.***//",
