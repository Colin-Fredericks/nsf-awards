 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second generation of interprocessor communication networks for              multicomputers, the wormhole-routed network, is currently in                    production.  Initial experience indicates that long communication               paths are no longer a problem with these machines.  However,                    resources such as network channels are reserved for communication,              and the resulting contention can degrade performance.  Our tests                on a production machine indicate that the problem becomes more                  severe as the number of nodes increases.  We are interested in the              effect of this contention on the programmer.  Clearly, the old                  technique of mapping problems onto multicomputers using distance                as a metric no longer applies.  The research is on the development              of new metrics that consider contention.  We propose a metric which             has been shown to be effective for static mapping of homogeneous                tasks.  We are investigating an improved metric which can handle                inhomogeneous tasks.  Our ultimate goal is a metric which can be                useful for both static and dynamic mappings.  In order to handle                the latter case, a metric must be simple enough to be calculated,               or recalculated, quickly.  Our metric fits that requirement.  We                also develop load balancing techniques using our metric for                     computational physics problems.  Applying our techniques to real                problems on real machines ensure that our research is useful to the             computing community.",
