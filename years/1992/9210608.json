 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a formal model relating the syntactic, semantic,             and discourse level analyses of texts will be investigated.  This               model will be organized around the notion of \"discourse events\"                 which involve the creation, modification, or manipulation of the                propositional structure contributed by sentence constituents.                   Along with the development of the formal models, computational                  support for the analysis to texts in terms of the model will be                 implemented.  With such support, a large collection of analyzed                 texts and utterances will be accumulated.  The model will also                  serve as the specification for the design and implementation of                 integrated natural language understanding programs.  The primary                methods to be employed will include unification based grammar                   formalisms and logic programming techniques.  The theoretical                   background for the approach will be based on the analysis of                    \"speech acts\" by Searle, the \"projection semantics\" of Halvorsen                and Kaplan, and the lexical functional\" approach to grammar                     developed by Kaplan and Bresnan, as well as the techniques for                  implementing all of these, developed by the PI.  It is important                to understand the contributions that all linguist levels make to                the workings of texts.  The discourse events model is meant to                  serve as a way to organize the analysis of those contributions.",
