 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the enzymes involved in de novo purine                biosynthesis and their regulation. There is now genetic evidence                that three enzyme activities of de novo purine biosynthesis reside              on a single polypeptide chain. The protein has been isolated from               a murine lymphoma cell line in low yield and characterized as to                size, formyl group donor, trifunctionality, and kinetic mechanism               of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART). The studies                will now be extended to use molecular biology techniques to prepare             the human trifunctional protein in high yield from bacteria, to                 prepare an expression vector to obtain only the GART domain from                bacteria and then do site-directed mutagenesis of it, and to try to             crystallize both the trifunctional protein and the GART domain to               do structural studies in the presence of substrate analogs which                are dead-end inhibitors. These carbocyclic nucleotide analogs are               being synthesized at present, and will be used to analyze the                   mechanism of conversion of IMP, the product of the de novo purine               synthesis, to AMP and GMP. The activity of AMP and GMP analogs and              their 2-deoxy analogs will be used to study the mechanisms of                   ribonucleotide reductase, RNA polymerase, and DNA polymerase.                   %%%                                                                             Synthesis of purines de novo is very important metabolically. While             most enzymes catalyze only a single reaction, it appears that three             successive reactions, involving transfer of two formyl groups, are              catalyzed by the same protein. This protein has been isolated from              mouse lymphoma cells, but the yield was very low. Molecular biology             techniques will be used to prepare both the trifunctional protein               and the GART domain. Residues thought to be important in the GART               catalytic activity will be changed to other, known residues, to see             their importance. Attempts will be made to crystallize both the                 entire protein and the GART domain, and studies using substrate                 analogs will be carried out to determine what the protein and                   protein fragment look like when they are in their active forms.",
