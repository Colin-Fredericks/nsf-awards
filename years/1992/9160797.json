Recently copious emission of electrons has been observed from                   ferroelectric materials upon fast polarization change.  Using                   lead zirconium titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanam zirconium                      titanate (PLZT) electron emission current densities of                          100A/cm2 have been observed.  This current density is about an                  order of magnitude larger than possible with thermionic                         cathodes and close to the maximum obtained with laser driven                    photocathodes.  The ferroelectric source is a room temperature                  emitter with a theoretical brightness limit a 3.2X1012                          A/m2.rad2 which is an order of magnitude large than present                     photocathodes.  The beam emittance, brightness and spatial                      profile will be measured during Phase I.  This simple source                    has the potential to replace thermionic and photocathodes in                    advanced accelerators and RF sources.  The source is                            potentially attractive due to the high brightness obtainable                    with a simple system as compared to thermionic cathodes                         requiring pulsed bunching for high currents or photocathodes                    driven by large lasers.",
