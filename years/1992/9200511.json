 "awd_abstract_narration": "Restoration of degraded communities is an important tool for                    basic research as it provides an acid test of our understanding                 of ecological processes.  Successful restoration of communities                 requires a thorough understanding of successful establishment and               persistance of plant species (i.e. their regeneration niche).                   Current hypotheses that explain why species may vary in their                   ability to colonize and persist in communities are few and have                 not been adequately tested.  In this study we will analyze and                  compare important regeneration niche characteristics of eight                   species of perennial, prairie forbs which vary in establishment                 success in restoration projects.  Using degraded remnant                        populations of different sizes, density, and dispersion, we will                analyze pollination success, fecundity, predispersal seed                       predation and herbivory of each species.  We also analyze                       germination patterns of seeds from the remnants.  Experimental                  field studies will be used to determine seed longevity in the                   soil bank and the effects of disturbance and cover type on                      seedling emergence and survivorship.  The type of study we                      propose is essential to understanding successful establishment                  and persistance of perennials in complex communities as well as                 developing successful restoration and management plans.",
