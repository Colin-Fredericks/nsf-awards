 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this Summer Science Camp are to generate and                       maintain an interest in science and mathematics among                           African-American and Hispanic students and to encourage                         them to consider careers in science and mathematics.                            Sixty rising seventh-, eighth-, and ninth grade minority                        students from Knoxville, Chattanooga, and other areas of                        East Tennessee will partricipate in this camp.  The                             program foccuses on both life and physical sciencw, thus                        exposing them to two major divisions of scientific                              inquiry.  Mathematics, as well as other discipline areas,                       are integrated into the four-week residential program.                          The life science component focuses on population studies;                       the physical science component focuses on the science and                       mathematics of several aspects of daily living and                              recreation.  Biology, mathematics, geology, chemistry,                          physics, money management, and nutrition are intgegral                          facets of the both project areas.  Students participate                         in hands-on research activities interspersed with                               discussions related to their activities.  In addition,                          students participate in career guidance and counseling                          activities, learn to write and present a formal report,                         practice good study skills, are exposed to motivational                         programs, and interact with  role models from a variety                         of settings.  During the four-week camp, activities will                        also be offered for parents and siblings.  Instructors                          are experienced college and high school staff members,                          practicing scientists and mathematicians, and high shcool                       students.  Follow-up activities during the academic year                        will be on a bi-monthly basis.",
