 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Philip Helfrich is the Director of the Hawaii Institute                of Marine Biology, which is a research organization within the                  University of Hawaii system.  The Institute operates a marine                   laboratory on Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, approximately                40 miles from the main campus of the University.  The Lab is                    actively used by resident and visiting investigators for a variety              of research projects, many of which focus on the nearby coral reef              tracts.  Dr. Helfrich has initiated a program of laboratory                     renovation that will repair building decay resulting from harsh                 conditions near shoreline.                                                           The planned renovations will produce weather-tight lab space               suitable for scientific instruments and biochemical procedures.                 Ongoing research projects will become more effective, and many new              projects will be initiated because of the availability of suitable              lab facilities.  The tropical reefs adjacent to the Coconut Island              Lab have been the subject of important research on reef ecology,                physiology of marine organisms, photobiology, and many other                    topics.  Important future research on these reefs will depend on                easy access to state-of-the-art lab facilities.",
