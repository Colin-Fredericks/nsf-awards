 "awd_abstract_narration": "The daily radio series EARTH AND SKY began airing nationally on                 September 30, 1991.  It consists of 2-minute programs about                     Earth science and astronomy.  Produced in association with the                  American Geophysical Union, it is designed for people of all                    ages.  Its aim is to make science accessible and interesting to                 millions whose common bond is that they happen to be listening                  to the radio.                                                                                                                                                   On February 1, 1992, the series was airing on 63 commercial and                 public radio stations, which had paid for it, and the number of                 stations was growing.  Producers and hosts Deborah Byrd and Joel                Block were responsible for 5,000 daily programs in the award-                   winning STAR DATE radio series.  Partial support is requested                   for the production, distribution and promotion of 780 programs                  in the EARTH AND SKY series.  The goal for the grant period is                  to acquire a large listening audience via heavy promotion.                      After three years, EARTH AND SKY will be self-supporting on 371                 stations, more stations than for any previous series of this                    king.",
