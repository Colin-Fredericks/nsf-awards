 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water is important to plants during all stages of development.  The             lack of sufficient water can place strains on plants, which may                 result in decreased yields or increased susceptibility to disease.              Yet plants not only survive but proliferate on land, even in water-             limited environments such as semi-arid areas and deserts.  This                 remarkable ability to tolerate seemingly inhospitable conditions                is due to the cumulative effects of nmerous adaptive properties                 that exist within plants.  In seed-bearing plants the best example              of such adaptability is the seed itself, which often remains alive              in a relatively dry state for many years.  Studies over the last                decade have demonstrated that growing plants and the embryos (or                germ) within dry seeds have much in common at the cellular and                  biochemical level.  For example, certain proteins that accumulate               within the cells of growing plants during water-limitation are also             found in embryo cells during their normal maturation drying                     process.  Dehydrins are one such group of proteins and are the                  focus of this research project.  The basic question that will be                addressed by this rpoject is what role dehydrins play in adaptation             to cellular dehydration.  The location of dehydrins within plant                cells will be determined, and blochemical tests of function will                be carried out on dehydrin protein that has been extracted from                 plant cells.  In addition, dehydrin genes will be examined in                   normal and mutant plants.  Through an understanding of the                      fundamental biochemical role and genetics of dehydrins, it may be               possible in the longer term to design new strategies for the                    development of plants with improved tolerance to environmental                  stress.",
