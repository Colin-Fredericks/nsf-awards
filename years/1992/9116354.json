 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France                                      cooperative research between Brian Hauge of the                                 Massachusetts General Hospital and Jerome                                       Giraudat of the Institute of Plant Sciences,                                    the French National Center for Scientific                                       Research.  The objective of their research is                                   to investigate plant-hormone action at the                                      molecular level.  They propose to characterize                                  plant hormone biosynthetic and response genes                                   in Arabidopsis.  They will clone genes which                                    are involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and                                         gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis.  Dr. Hauge is                                    experienced in cloning the GA biosynthetic                                      pathway.  This is complemented by Dr.                                           Giraudat's involvement in  synthesis of the ABA                                 hormone and his expertise on hormone receptors.                                 Their combined efforts, coupled with the clones                                 and maps from their respective laboratories,                                    will facilitate rapid and efficient cloning of                                  these genes.                                                                                                                                                    The molecular and genetic characterization of                                   GA and ABA hormonal action will provide                                         important data regarding the mechanism                                          governing plant-hormone interaction.  Since                                     this project will also generate physical maps                                   in the vicinity of the interaction, the                                         collaboration will contribute to the overall                                    mapping of the Arabidopsis genome.",
