 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant meristems are located at the tips of growing roots and                    shoots.  They are comprised of densely cytoplasmic,                             undifferentiated, dividing cells.  These cells have properties                  characteristic of \"stem cells\" in that their descendants give rise              not only to more undifferentiated, meristematic cells but also to               the many different cell types that make up the plant body.  Thus,               understanding how shoot apical meristems work is not only critical              to understanding the development of plants but will also shed light             on the more general problem of how undifferentiated \"stem cell\"                 populations of cells generate complex structures comprised of many              different cell types.                                                                                                                                           This new investigator proposes to identify, isolate and                         characterize a clone the wild-type DNA encoding the                             SHOOTLESS locus of Arabidopsis.  Possible practical applications                of this research include the ability to more precisely control                  shoot regeneration.  The data thus far suggest that the SHOOTLESS               locus is necessary for the formation  of a shoot apical meristem.               It is possible that in addition to being necessary for shoot                    meristem formation, the SHOOTLESS product is also sufficient for                shoot meristem formation.  If this is true, an increase in the                  expression of the SHOOTLESS product would increase the likelihood               that a given tissue would regenerate shoots.  Learning how to                   control such a gene would result in an increased ability to                     regenerate shoots from tissues or species that are otherwise                    recalcitrant to shoot regeneration protocols.  This would                       accelerate the creation of new varieties of commercially important              plant species.//",
