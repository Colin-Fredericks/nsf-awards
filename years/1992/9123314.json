 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Rosemary Renaut of Arizona                        State University to collaborate in mathematics research                         with Professor Rolf Jeltsch of the Applied Mathematics                          Group of the Swiss Federal Institute (ETH), Zurich.                             They are studying the stability of certain numerical                            algorithms for solving hyperbolic differential                                  equations.  Typically, numerical solutions to these                             differential equations can be found by a variety of                             methods such as finite elements, spectral methods and                           finite difference methods.  In this proposal finite                             difference methods are emphasized.                                                                                                                              Realistic solutions of hyperbolic initial boundary value                        problems are required in many areas including                                   computational fluid mechanics, geophysics and                                   aerodynamics.  A complete geometric description of the                          order star of Riemann surfaces will provide insight into                        the stability and accuracy of numerical algorithms to                           solve these problems.  Both researchers have been active                        in the numerical solution of hyperbolic equations; Dr.                          Renaut's work has been mainly concentrated on the wave                          equation, while Dr. Jeltsch has worked on the advection                         equation.  Many other problems will benefit from a                              deeper understanding of these numerical algorithms.",
