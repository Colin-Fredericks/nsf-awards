 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gerard Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia                         University, is one of thirty recipients of the 1992                             Presidential Faculty Fellow Award.  This prestigious award for                  young faculty members is given in recognition of excellence and                 promise in scientific research and teaching.  Parkin was                        honored for work in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry.  He                   has shown through meticulous methods that bond-stretch                          isomerism is an artifact of crystallographic impurities.  His                   work with main group and transition metal complexes of                          (pyrazolyl)hydroborate have led to novel results.  First, he                    isolated and characterized the first monomeric three-coordinate                 zinc alkyl derivative and the monomeric terminal hydride                        complexes of zinc and beryllium.  In addition, he has developed                 a monomeric zinc hydroxy derivative which serves as a                           structural and chemical model for active site of the enzyme                     carbonic anhydrase.  Recently, he has isolated compounds with                   terminal tellurium bonds.  He is also known as an enthusiastic                  teacher and mentor and has been involved in curriculum revision                 and a special program with high school students.",
