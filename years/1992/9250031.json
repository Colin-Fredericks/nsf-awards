 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Secondary Science Teacher Education Program (Second STEP)                   at Miami University will address the preparation of teachers                    who are competent and willing to teach in diverse cultural and                  ethnic settings, assess the effectiveness of individual                         accumulative program activities on teaching behavior, and                       compare the effectiveness of an innovative program with that                    of two traditional teacher education programs.  The Second                      STEP project will develop new undergraduate science content                     courses and revise education courses to include integrated                      field experiences for prospective science teachers.  The                        program will be based on emerging research on science teaching                  and learning and cultivate an established liaison with a                        predominantly minority school system.  The Program will foster                  the integration of content expertise, content-specific                          pedagogy and teaching practice.  A major focus will be to                       establish opportunities for prospective teachers to gain early                  and practical experiences with diverse (racial, ethnic, or                      cultural) learners.  Although the Second STEP Program will                      directly address undergraduate science teacher education, its                   activities are also designed to impact the professional                         development of both science and education faculty at Miami                      University as well as teachers of a major urban school                          district.",
