 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following termination in 1973 of federal programs aimed at large-            scale urban housing construction, local governments have assumed greater        responsibility for policy development and implementation to meet                neighborhood housing needs.  Different jurisdictions have responded in          different ways, but many have sought to target investments in areas             where they hoped that public assistance would spur private redevelopment        efforts, thereby leading to neighborhood revitalization.  The selection         of sites where public investments are made are crucial decisions in the         implementation of policies like these.  Despite considerable monitoring,        relatively little scientific attention has focused on the impacts of            these investments on the neighborhood quality and on the demographic            composition of neighborhood residents.  This project, which is supported        by a Research-Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers, will           refine conceptual frameworks for exploration of these and related               questions, and it will provide an opportunity for identification and            preliminary analyses of data with which to address these issues.                Preliminary work will focus on one or more cities in New York state.            Among data sources to be explored at the Census of Population and               Housing, data from various public agencies documenting public services          and publicly assisted housing, and other geographic information                 available from the New York State Data Center.                                     This project will provide new insights into the general knowledge of         the ways that public housing investments and policies, and it will              establish a sound base for future empirical analyses of the impacts of          public housing decisions on neighborhood dynamics.  In addition, the            project will provide a superb opportunity for a young female scholar            with an excellent background to further improve her basic research              skills.",
