Brodkorb, a distinguished ornithologist, amassed an                             internationally important collection of 31,000 skeletal specimens               of extant and fossil birds, which he donated to FLMNH upon his                  retirement in 1989.  The osteological material represents some                  2500 species and is 11th largest in the world in terms of                       specimens and fifth largest in number of species.  The fossil                   material includes the type specimens of 42 new species and the                  collection as a whole figured in 29 projects for graduate degrees               at the University of Florida.  After incorporation, the FLMNH                   avian osteology collection will rank fifth in size in the United                States, and the fossil bird collection fourth.  The latter is one               of the finest in the world.  Each collection is integral to                     biological research and education at the University of Florida -                - each collection is well used by researchers and students at                   FLMNH and elsewhere.  This use will increase with incorporation                 of the PBOC.  The incorporation plan involves identification of                 5000 fossil specimens, cataloguing, computerization and rehousing               of the entire collection.  FLMNH is providing the equipment.",
