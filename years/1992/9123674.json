 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traveling waves of excitation provide for communication and                spatial organization in a variety of biological systems.  The                   long-term goal of this project is to study mathematically the                   origin and properties of traveling waves of excitation in heart                 muscle, in fields of aggregating cells, in fields of dividing                   cells, and in nonliving chemical mixtures.  The investigator                    emphasizes those features of wave propagation that are common to                all excitable media because of their similar mathematical                       description.  At the same time, the best current                                scientific understanding of specific mechanisms is built into the               models, so that detailed quantitative comparisons between theory                and experiment can be sought.  The models are studied by                        analytical mathematical methods and by numerical simulations.                        In modern industrialized nations, the two most common causes               of death are heart disease and cancer.  Each is a                               complicated suite of diseases with many different causes and                    treatments. Nonetheless, at a fundamental level, hearts fail                    because the electrical stimulation of heart muscle contraction                  goes awry, and cancers spread because the normal controls over                  cell growth and division are short-circuited.  To develop                       rational strategies to treat or cure these diseases, one must                   understand the basic biological machinery that controls the                     contraction of heart muscle and the division of body cells.  The                investigator and other mathematical biologists are using powerful               mathematical tools to unravel the inner workings of the beating                 heart and the dividing cell.  Their models have revealed                        previously hidden secrets.  For instance, the rapid disorganized                fluttering of a failing heart is caused by tiny rotating waves of               contraction the spin out of control in the heart muscle.                        Mathematical models are used to uncover the laws that govern                    these spinning waves, that dictate their onset and demise, and                  that hold the key to their treatment.  Similarly, the laws that                 govern cell division, that determine which cells shall divide and               when, are ultimately expressible with mathematical precision.  As               these laws become clear, through experimental and theoretical                   investigations, it will be possible to use them intelligently to                bring renegade cancer cells back under control.",
