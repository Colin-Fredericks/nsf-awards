 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Patricia Gilman will conduct one season of archaeological                   excavation in the San Simon drainage, located in Southeastern                   Arizona.  She will focus on the Pit Structure period which dates                from ca. AD 500-1050 and excavate a series of habitation                        structures of varying size.  Entire structures as well as                       immediate surrounding areas will be completely opened to provide                a full picture of settlement pattern.  A wide range of recovered                materials will be analyzed to determine chronology, subsistence                 practices and degree of mobility.  An attempt will also be made                 to determine the season when each site was occupied.                                                                                                            The goal of this project is to reconstruct the settlement and                   mobility pattern during the Pit House period.  For decades                      archaeologists have studied the large pit house structures which                give this period its name.  These semi-buried houses have been                  interpreted as \"permanent\" structures and taken to imply a                      settled way of life.  Dr. Gilman, however, has noted that in                    other regions of the world similar structures are used on a                     seasonal basis and she hypothesizes that the same may hold true                 in the U.S. Southwest.  This position is supported by the                       observation that smaller sites from the same time period are also               found in the region and these may represent a different part of a               seasonal round.  The planned excavations and analyses are                       designed to test this possibility.                                                                                                                              In the Southwestern United States archaeologists have traced the                transformation of prehistoric groups from small scale hunting and               gathering societies to large polities with year round settlements               and centralized political organization.  However, the process                   which lead to this change is not well understood.  Increasing                   sedentism probably played a role, but just what is uncertain.                   This research should help to resolve this question.  It will also               produce data of interest to many archaeologists.",
