 "awd_abstract_narration": "In large scale sample surveys,  estimates of a variety of                  characteristics are frequently given for large populations.                     Similar estimates for smaller domains or areas also are required.               Recently,  considerable attention has been given to improve                     procedures related to small area estimation problems.  The                      traditional sample survey estimators which use information from a               given small area often yield large standard errors because of small             sample size in the area.  Reliable small area statistics are needed             by many federal agencies for regional planning and allocating                   government resources.  Among these are the Bureau of Labor                      Statistics,  which is interested in providing estimates of the                  unemployment rate not only for the nation but also for the states               and the Census Bureau which inevitably misses people and must face              the problem of adjusting spatially for the undercounts.                              The investigator spent the last academic year at the Bureau                of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau as a Senior Research                  Fellow under the American Statistical Association/ National Science             Foundation Fellowship Program.  The proposed research is a                      continuation of his work at these agencies aimed at developing                  reliable small area statistics.  Attention is focussed on various               multivariate and time series models to combine information from                 related sources.  The plan is to develop different empirical and                hierarchical Bayes procedures.                                                       To determine measures of accuracy of the empirical Bayes                   estimators,  second order approximations will be sought to the mean             squared errors of the estimators.  This will require the extension              of the existing methodology to multivariate and time series                     modelling and also to the situation when the prior parameters are               estimated by the method of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum             likelihood.  It is anticipated that the posterior mean and the                  posterior variance in a hierarchical Bayes analysis will involve                multi-dimensional integrals.  Different sampling-based methods to               evaluate the integrals will be investigated.  In this context the               modification and approximation of the Gibbs sampling method will                be considered.                                                                       The principal investigator has a solid research record in                  small area estimation and is well equipped by experience and by his             collaborative ties with leading statisticians in the field to                   conduct the proposed research.  His successes in this project will              readily find applications in the particular areas of government                 with which he is familiar and other important arenas as well.",
