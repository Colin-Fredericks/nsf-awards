 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel method is being developed for study of sub-threshold                    synaptic events that occur within individual neurons in the awake               mammalian brain.  Unlike traditional methods which require                      impalement and resultant damage to a nerve cell by an intracellular             microelectrode, the present method uses an electrode which is                   extracellular.  Far less cellular damage results, therefore, and                sub-threshold synaptic events can be studied for very long periods              of time.  The method entails passing extracellular current pulses               through a recording microelectrode and measuring the threshold of               the neuron under study to this direct electrical stimulation.                                                                                                   This research explores the application of this new method to two                problem areas in cortical neurophysiology:  (1) the analysis of sub-            threshold receptive fields and components of receptive fields in                sensory neocortex, and (2) the analysis of sub-threshold synaptic               inputs to neurons studied with chronically implanted electrodes over            very long periods of time.  This research will contribute to a                  better understanding of the cortical neuronal substrates of sensory             perception and the dynamic mechanisms by which the properties of                individual neurons are modified by experience over long periods of              time.",
