 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent problems with the savings and loan industry are                          reminiscent of four other American mortgage market crises between               1830 and 1940.  Each episode was accompanied by severe                          macroeconomic dislocation, and was intimately connected to                      innovations or modifications of existing lending arrangements.                  This project is designed to investigate one of these episodes,                  the mortgage boom of the 1800s and the bust of the 1890s.  Two                  innovations were introduced in the 1870s to stimulate the flow of               mortgage funds from the Northeast to the agricultural frontier:                 western mortgage banks, and mortgage lending by eastern life                    insurance companies.  The volume of lending through both channels               increased rapidly for two decades.  But nearly all of the western               mortgage banks collapsed when the western land boom ended in the                early 1890s, while the mortgage investments of the life insurance               companies continued to perform satisfactorily.  The goal of this                project is to explain why the performance of these two                          innovations was so different.  This research is important because               it will provide a better understanding of why institutional                     innovations in the mortgage market have been so fragile                         throughout the history of American economic development.                                                                                                        The most appealing explanations for the failure of nineteenth                   century mortgage banks emphasize that informational asymmetries                 are inherent in institutional mortgage lending.  However, these                 hypotheses have yet to be tested because information on                         individual mortgage contracts is not easily attained.  The data                 base to be assembled will contain detailed information on more                  than 70,000 mortgages made by the Aetna Life Insurance Company,                 and a Kansas mortgage bank (the J. B. Watkins Company) in eight                 western states.  These were two of the most important                           institutional lenders operating in the western farm mortgage                    market between 1870 and 1900.  These data will be used to examine               whether differences in the design of contracts and lending                      practices explain why institutions such as the Watkins Company                  failed, while insurance companies were having little trouble with               their mortgage portfolios.  Other scholars will also find this                  data set useful for addressing a broad range of economic, social,               and political issues connected to nineteenth-century western farm               settlement and mortgage making.",
