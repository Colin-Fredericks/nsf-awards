 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the analysis of solution of                   partial differential equations, systems as well as scalar                       equations.  The equations of interest arise in mathematical                     physics and differential geometry.  Emphasis will be placed on                  the study of the Yamabe problem in a complete Riemannian                        manifold, a problem of considerable interest which can be                       formulated in terms of semi-linear elliptic equations.  The                     problem is then one of finding positive solutions to the                        equations and analyzing their asymptotic behavior.  This work                   motivates in a natural way efforts to understand a larger class                 of solutions by means of critical points of the Sobolev quotient.               The solutions are believed to be infinitely differentiable in the               complement of sets whose Hausdorff dimension is precisely                       estimated by means of the nonlinear term in the differential                    equation.  Work will also be done on harmonic maps, particularly                in studying the regularity of minimizing harmonic maps into                     singular objects like varifolds. A recent new proof of the                      regularity of minimizing harmonic maps between two compact                      Riemannian manifolds suggests that an expansion is possible to                  target domains which are Lipschitz graphs. Most of the attention                is paid to the sets of regularity for harmonic maps.  But there                 are now some general results concerning the singular sets as                    well.  They may have reasonable structures, such as curves or                   unions of smooth curves.  Further work will be done to determine                what classifications of singular sets are possible.                                  Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                     expressing solutions.",
