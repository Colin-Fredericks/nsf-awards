 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early Paleozoic poriferans of the Western Hemisphere are among             the least known of fossil invertebrate phyla, even though they are              important constituents of reefs and inter-reef faunas, and even                 though North America seemed to have functioned as a major center                of sponge evolution during the early Paleozoic.  Objectives of the              research are to publish monographic and synthesis papers on major               Lower and Middle Ordovician faunas, from North America, including               those from classic stratigraphic sections in western Newfoundland               and from the Mingan Islands of eastern Quebec.  These faunas are                from the northern part of the Appalachian-Maritime region, which                was on the southeastern margin of the Ordovician paleocontinent.                Other major faunas to be studied are from Lower and Middle                      Ordovician rocks in the Confusion Range (Ibex area) of western                  Utah, and from equivalent rocks of the Toquima Range-Eureka-Ruby                Mountain are of central and east-central Nevada.  These latter                  faunas represent those from the northwestern margin of the                      Ordovician North American paleocontinent.  Fossil sponges to be                 studied were generally collected from measured stratigraphic                    sections that have been selected as type or reference sections and              that characterize broad regions in North America.  Fossils will be              studied using standard thin-section and acetate-peel techniques                 because the originally siliceous skeletons have been largely                    replaced by calcium carbonate in most fossils in the collection.                A few potentially etchable sponges have been collected from Utah                and Nevada, and they will be processed in dilute acids.  Even                   fragments of such sponges have proven to be important because they              show skeletal details that are often obscure in calcareous                      preservations.  Taxonomy, paleoecology, stratigraphic and                       paleogeographic distributions and potential for biostratigraphic                zonation, along with evolution of the assemblages, will be treated              in an effort to present uniform data and synthesis of the scattered             and uneven literature.",
