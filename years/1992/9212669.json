 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic relationships within insects, the most diverse                class of organisms, are a major unsolved systematic problem.                    Nucleotide sequence characters could be a key part of the answer,               but there have been only a few studies, based mostly on the same                gene.  One model system is the enormous order Lepidoptera                       (150,000 species), subject of innumerable comparative research                  programs whose well-studied basal relationships provide a strong                test for the utility of new molecules.  Prior to this project,                  computer search, Southern hybridization, and polymerase chain                   reaction (PCR) studies were used to identify five previously                    untested nuclear genes which appear suitable for higher-level                   phylogenetics (elongation factor-l (alpha), the largest subunit                 of RNA polymerase II, dopa decarboxylase, elongation factor-2,                  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase).  Oligonucleotide primers were               synthesized for all five genes, plus the nuclear ribosomal RNA                  gene, and tested for successful genomic amplification in                        primitive Lepidoptera and related panorpoid orders.  Portions of                the elongation factor-1 (alpha) and ribosomal genes have been                   sequenced directly from PCR products for 6 and 11 taxa,                         respectively.  The resulting trees, under several analytical                    methods, show concordance with morphology.                                           Additional studies will complete evaluation of potentially                 informative nuclear genes by sequencing larger portions of                      elongation factor 1 (alpha), RNA polymerase II and the ribosomal                gene in 15 species that together represent relationships strongly               supported by morphology within basal Lepidoptera and closely                    related orders.  Trees constructed by independent analyses of                   each gene will be tested for concordance with each other and with               the morphological phylogeny.  For genes showing strong                          concordance, the analysis will then be extended to an additional                20 moth species that sample, in duplicate, all major lower                      lepidopteran lineages, including problematic relationships;                     sufficiently conservative genes will additionally be used to                    initiate a broader study of relationships among panorpoid orders.",
