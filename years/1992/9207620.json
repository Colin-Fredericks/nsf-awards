 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to determine what factors limit             or regulate populations of migratory birds that breed in the north              temperate forests and winter in the Neotropics.  The basic question             concerns whether these factors operate more importantly in summer               breeding areas at temperate latitudes, in neotropical winter                    quarters, or during both seasons.  Through demographic and                      experimental studies, hypothesis will be tested to determine (1) if             limitations occur in both summer and winter, (2) if habitat                     occupancy is determined by social dominance (despotism) or other                preemptive behavior, (3) if individuals vary in fitness among                   habitats, that is, the demographic consequences of despotic habitat             selection, and (4) what ecological variable affect habitat quality              and therefore fitness.  Emphasis will be on differential fitness                among habitats in both summer and winter, including second-growth               forests, agricultural lands, and other human-modified habitats.                 The results will advance our understanding of the population                    dynamics and community relations of these migrant bird species, as              well as the factors affecting their population abundances.  Such                information also will contribute to the development of sound and                effective conservation policies.",
