 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cortex of the human brain is divided anatomically into two                  hemispheres, the right and the left, which, though roughly                      symmetrical in appearance, are not completely equivalent in their               information processing abilities and propensities.  This research               will investigate the consequences of this functional hemispheric                asymmetry for information processing in neurologically normal                   individuals.  The research will do so by investigating the manner               in which the two hemispheres make complementary contributions to                perception, cognition, and action.  One set of studies will                     increase our understanding of the nature of left-hemisphere                     dominance for a variety of linguistic processes as well as the                  consequences of this hemispheric asymmetry for the strategies                   typically utilized by neurologically normal individuals.  A second              set of studies will investigate in a number of different ways the               hypothesis that the two hemispheres are predisposed toward the                  efficient use of different types of visual information, i. e., that             the right hemisphere makes most efficient use of global or holistic             aspects of visual patterns whereas the left hemisphere makes most               efficient use of local or more fine-grained detail.  A third set of             studies will investigate the ways in which the brain encodes                    information about spatial dimensions such as left versus right.  A              fourth set of studies will deal with the question of how it is that             unity of thought and action emerges from a brain consisting of two              hemispheres that differ in so many ways.  These studies will                    determine the variety of ways in which the two hemispheres interact             with each other.  Of particular importance are studies that will                determine when and how the style of processing characteristic of                one hemisphere or the other comes to dominate performance.                      Cognitive neuroscience has helped us to understand the modular                  nature of the brain, to break it down into meaningful components.               These studies of interhemispheric interaction will begin to put the             components back together.  A fifth set of studies will investigate              individual differences in these aspects of hemispheric asymmetry                and interhemispheric interaction.  This will be done by having the              same individuals participate in a variety of experimental tasks and             by discovering how performance on one task relates to performance               on others.  All five sets of studies will address basic issues in               cognitive neuroscience.  At the same time, the outcomes will have               implications for a variety of more applied questions.  For example,             it has been hypothesized that a variety of learning disabilities                such as dyslexia and attentional deficit disorder result from                   unusual patterns of hemispheric asymmetry or from difficulty in                 coordinating the activities of the two hemispheres.  The                        noninvasive behavioral techniques emerging from this research will              be capable of separating the many aspects of hemispheric asymmetry              and interhemispheric interaction and should make it possible to                 test these hypotheses.",
