 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI  plans to examine (1) involvement of natural                        hydrocarbons for the formation of H2O2 and HCHO in air and (2)                  liquid phase formation of H2O2 and organic acids in clouds.                     Specifically, he will conduct continuous measurements of                        formaldehyde and peroxides in the gas phase, in cloud water, and in             precipitation at Whiteface Mountain with concurrent measurements of             other key atmosheric trace gases, including O3, CO, NOy, SO2 and                selected hydrocarbons and trace elements.  The goal is to document              the chemistry of individual cloud events and to determine seasonal              and air mass specific differences in cloud water chemical                       composition.  Additionally, the PI plans a limited flight program               focussing on measuring horizontal and vertical profiles for H2O2 and            O3 under clearly defined meteorological conditions in clear and                 cloudy air, including airborne cloud water collections.  He will                also add measurements of other photochemically important species                such as hydroperoxides and other low molecular carbonyl compounds               (aldehydes and ketones) as the initial research program matures.",
