 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers use the \"H-R Diagram\" (surface temperature vs.                      luminosity) of stellar clusters to infer the evolutionary                       properties of stars of a common age and chemical abundance.                     Over a decade ago it was noticed that the distribution of                       stars along the \"horizontal branch\" of globular clusters                        depends in part on chemical abundance and in part on something                  else.  What this \"something else\" might be constitutes the                      \"second parameter problem\" in the study of stellar clusters.                    In earlier NSF-supported work the Principal Investigator (PI)                   has found, to the surprise of most astronomers, that horizontal                 branch stars rotate rather rapidly.  The PI will examine the                    rotation rates of horizontal stars in eight globular clusters                   to determine whether rotation is the missing parameter.                         In addition, the PI's earlier work led theoretical astronomers                  to suggest that the rotation rates of cores of intermediate mass                stars may continue to remain high during the stars' lifetimes while             the rates at their surfaces decelerate from the influence of                    magnetic fields in their coronae.  The new work is expected to test             this possibility and to offer one of the few ways of inferring the              interior rotation rates of stars currently on the \"main sequence.\"              These interior rates are otherwise inaccessible to our direct                   measurement.",
