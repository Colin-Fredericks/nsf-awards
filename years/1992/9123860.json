Dr. Jeanne Selker of the                     University of Oregon and Dr. Robert Lyndon of the University of                 Edinburgh will jointly study the transition in patterns of appendage            formation in developing plants.  They will study two plant systems:             (1) Silene transition to flowering; and (2) watercress root-to-shoot            conversion.  The proposed work will involve observations of the                 growth of apices during the transition period and experiments                   aimed at identifying the causal events which either prevent                     transition or produce no effect whatsoever.  Dr. Selker brings to               this collaboration expertise in the biophysical characterization of             cell patterns in plant apices.  This is complemented by Dr.                     Lyndon's extensive work on the Silene and watercress systems and                his innovative experimental approaches to characterizing and                    manipulating plant developing systems.                                                                                                                          Plant appendages, such as leaves, petals and stamens, are produced              at the shoot apex in a pattern.  Researchers do not understand how              appendages are produced in a specific pattern or what causes these              patterns to change.  The proposed research will yield valuable                  knowledge and correlations about the transition processes and                   pattern formations.",
