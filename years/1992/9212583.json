 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of genetic factors to the short-term survival of                 natural populations is not known.  Small populations lose genetic               variation due to genetic drift (random loss) more quickly than                  large populations, and may experience inbreeding depression.                    However, the relationship between inbreeding, genetic variation,                and population survival is unclear.  The first part of this                     proposal research project will examine the importance of genetic                variation on the immediate survival of small populations.  The PIs              will test whether populations founded with greater initial genetic              variation are more likely to persist, as measured by smaller                    fluctuations in population size and larger mean size, than                      populations founded with lower amounts of genetic variation.                    Secondly, the PIs propose to examine the effectiveness of migration             in reducing the potentially detrimental effects of inbreeding and               genetic drift.  The effect of different levels of migration on                  population fecundity will be assessed.  Information regarding the               minimum rates of migration needed to balance the detrimental                    effects of inbreeding and drift is necessary for prescribing                    management procedures on isolated, small populations of rare                    species.",
