 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to study the temperature field                  around a rapidly propagating crack tip in metals.  Because of the               high rate effects occurring in rapidly propagating cracks, the                  classical Fourier heat conduction formulation is replaced by the                so-called thermal wave theory, in which there is a finite                       propagation speed for heat conduction.  The heat generation rate                in the local area surrounding the moving crack tip is modelled by               the rate of dynamic plastic work, using several different                       constitutive relations for the metal, each of which takes into                  account rate-sensitivity.  Predictions based on this theory will                be compared to available experimental results in order to establish             whether it is important to utilize thermal wave theory to                       accurately predict crack propagation phenomena in metals, and to                determine the appropriateness of the different constitutive                     relations employed in this study.",
