 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for repair and rehabilitation                                of the Glassell Building and its contiguous pen.                                This seawater facility is utilized by every                                     scientific research program on the RSMAS campus                                 that requires direct access to seawater.  These                                 programs include investigations in coral ecology,                               plankton ecology, pathology, physiology, animal                                 behavior, bioacoustics, biochemistry and the                                    culture of marine organisms.  It also provides                                  space and instrumentation for both graduate and                                 undergraduate students being trained in one or                                  more of these disciplines.  This renovation is                                  indispensable for continuing and expanding these                                and future programs at the School and is essential                              if they are to achieve and maintain state-of-the-                               art capabilities in experimental marine biology.                                Currently, users are handicapped by the difficult                               environment of a building that has served as the                                School's major seawater facility for 28 years.                                  Within the last two years, the School has                                       conducted a major renovation of the entire                                      exterior of the Glassell Building, including                                    various structural repairs, supervised and                                      certified by structural engineers.  These have                                  assured that the building will be safe and secure                               for many years to come.  This award will complete                               the renovation of the entire facility.",
