 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will study damage-free ultraprecision machining                processes on advanced ceramic materials.  The goal is to generate               an improved understanding of the material-removal processes that                occur in nanometer-scale grinding of ceramics, and ultimately to                be able to control grinding damage generation in-process. The                   research plan includes extending the ductile-regime grinding model              to include toughened ceramics, and defining grinding machining                  parameters required for these materials.  Further modification of               the grinding process by the introduction of engineered                          chemomechanical effects on the ceramic surface will be developed,               through controlled surface toughening.  A goal of this research is              to develop a real-time acoustic emissions feedback system to                    measure and control grinding damage in-process.  Through                        preliminary research, the sensitivity of acoustic emissions to                  material removal processes has been established.  Understanding                 the basis of that sensitivity and its relationship to subsurface                fracture generation will guide development of an effective control              strategy.                                                                            It is expected that as a direct result of this research: (1)               models for ductile-regime grinding, developed by the principal                  investigator, will be extended to include tough, advanced ceramic               materials; (2) chemomechanical effects in machining of ceramics                 will be studied with regard to their potential for altering the                 surface properties of ceramics, thereby enhancing the machinability             of candidate ceramic materials; and (3) fracture-generated acoustic             emissions signals will be analyzed in a basic study of the these                elastic waves and their relationship to grinding-induced subsurface             damage.",
