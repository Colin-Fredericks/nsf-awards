 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ball will study geometric properties of metric spaces, in                  particular the Lp-spaces, which describe the rate at which random               walks in these spaces can wander.  He has shown that these                      properties are intimately connected with questions about                        factoring and extending Lipschitz maps.  The aim is to develop a                non-linear theory which parallels the powerful theory of type and               cotype in linear spaces.  Such a theory can be expected to have                 numerous applications to the analysis of the various types of                   metric spaces which arise in all areas of mathematics.                               Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                       attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                        structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                 axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                     relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                     \"parallelogram law\" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                 the \"geometry\" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                  the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory                of Banach spaces.",
