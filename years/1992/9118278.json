 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated field mapping - laboratory- hydrologic modeling              study will be conducted for the \"Kicking Horse Rim\" of the southern             Rocky Mountains in Canada, a well-exposed belt of massive                       replacement dolostone approximately 10 to 15 km wide that                       demarcates the transition from shelf to basin along the Lower                   Paleozoic passive margin of western North America.  Preliminary                 field work strongly suggests that the replacement dolomite is                   related to a complex network of large (hundreds of meter-scale),                dolomite breccia-and cement-filled fractures and pipes that riddles             the area.  Research will entail:  (1) mapping the locations of the              dolomite fractures and pipes through the massive dolomite of the                \"Kicking Horse Rim\"; (2) documenting the transitions from these                 dolomitization centers into the fine-grained replacement dolomite               and ultimately into the host country rock; (3) analyzing the fluid              inclusion, isotopic and trace element geochemistry of the various               dolomites; and (4) using data from (1), (2), and (3) as modeling                constraints in numerical simulations of various hydrologic systems              that could be responsible for dolomitization.                                        This study offers an integrated field-laboratory -modeling                 approach toward dolomitization by examining a dolomite body similar             in scale to many other massive replacement dolomites found in                   carbonate platform deposits.  The Kicking Horse Rim dolomites are               important insofar as warm, near sea water salinity fluids may have              been important during dolomitization.  The approach outlined here               should be applicable to the problem of the origin of dolomites in               general.  Finally, the exact nature of the Kicking Horse Rim                    dolomite may have important implications for the argument as to the             geometry of the shelf to basin transition.",
