The project                    has three goals.                                                                                                                                                1.   Kentucky students will acquire the conceptual                                   knowledge, process skills, thinking skills, and habits                          of mind that characterize scientific literacy.                                                                                                             2.   More Kentucky students, especially those from                                   underrepresented groups, will follow programs leading                           to science, mathematics, and technology-related                                 careers, including teaching.                                                                                                                               3.   The general public and opinion leaders in Kentucky will                         value knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and                         technology as important outcomes of education.                                                                                                             To achieve these goals, PRISM will coordinate mathematics                       and science initiatives in four areas:  develop teacher-                        specialists to support change in classroom practices; alter                     teacher preservice programs; develop and implement a plan to                    foster participation by underrepresented groups; and                            establish policy to enhance awareness and value of                              mathematics and science education.",
