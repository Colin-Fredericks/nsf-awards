 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deposit feeding is important in gating the transfer or burial of                all particles that arrive at the seafloor, with implications                    ranging from flow through trophic webs to resolution of the                     stratigraphic record.  The resources that fuel deposit feeding,                 however, remain poorly identified-with a few notable exceptions.                By chemical examination and biological experimentation that isolate             the processes of food detection and digestion this project will                 attempt to generalize the approach used to create a pair of those               exceptions.  This project will be guided by theory that predicts                maximization of net absorption rate as material transits the gut of             an organism.  The focus of the project is on three specific                     processes that modulate processes leading to this maximization,                 namely smell, taste and absorption across the gut wall.  Smell and              taste will be determined with chemical, operational definitions                 based on response to diffused or contacted compounds.  The efficacy             of compounds that elicit feeding responses in the laboratory will               be tested for their roles as attractants in the field.  While the               correlation between sensing ability and nutritional value will not              be perfect, the imperfection affects the ability of these animals               to sense the presence of food and so itself is of interest.  The                concept of optimal gut retention times of ingested food focuses                 attention on a kinetic definition of food quality, whose                        determination will also likely result in identification of usable               food resources.  Measurements of absorption of digested foods into              the gut wall will allow explicit tests of these models of                       absorption maximization on a series of animals from Puget Sound and             the Gulf of Maine.",
