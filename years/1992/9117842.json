Newton of the                                         University of Chicago to collaborate with three                                 Indian geologists: Dr. A.S Janardhan of Mysor                                   University, Dr. T.C. Devaraju of Karnatak                                       University, and Dr. B. Mahabaleswar of                                          Bangalore University.  The research will                                        continue investigations of the late Archean                                     deep-crustal section of southern Karnataka and                                  northern Tamil Nadu, India, following on the                                    earlier NSF-supported project of the Principal                                  investigator.  The orthopyroxene isograde                                       (\"Fermor's Line\") will be investigated as to                                    causative mineral reactions, areal continuity,                                  geochemical progression, and evidence for the                                   role of infiltrating fluids in the Archean deep                                 crust.  The major thrust of the project will be                                 the elucidation of the early history of a                                       continent.  The project also provides funds for                                 living expenses of the Indian scientists while                                  doing laboratory studies in the U.S.                                                                                                                            Scope: The U.S. scientist is a well respected                                   geologist with long experience in Indian                                        geological research.  He is particularly                                        qualified to accomplish the most through the                                    collaboration with the selected Indian                                          scientists.  The area of research is of                                         interest to the U.S. and is also of great                                       interest to the Indian scientists.  The project                                 fully meets the objectives of the US-India                                      Program.",
