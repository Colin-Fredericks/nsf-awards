 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Youth Development Study is a longitudinal examination             of the causes and correlates of serious delinquency and drug use.               Phase I of the study, funded primarily by the Office of Juvenile                Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) with some supplemental               support from the National Science Foundation and the National                   Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), followed a sample of high risk                  youth from the seventh and eighth grades until their eleventh and               twelfth grades at six month intervals.  This grant provides partial             support for Phase II which will follow the youth to early                       adulthood.  The objectives of the study are to understand the                   social and psychological factors associated with different stages               of criminal careers, especially the termination of careers for many             offenders during early adulthood, and the continuation and                      escalation of criminal behavior for others.                                                                                                                     Since much of the data collection for Phase II will continue to be              funded by OJJDP, the NSF support will be used for data analysis and             dissemination of findings.  Two major theoretical models that are               being tested, interactional theory and network theory, will be                  analyzed.  Also, issues such as onset, specialization, desistance,              and the link between delinquency and drug use will be examined.                 A number of publications are planned as a result of this work.                                                                                                  This project provides the most extensive delinquency data set                   assembled to date and already has contributed significantly to a                better understanding of the factors that contribute to, as well as              insulate against, serious involvement in crime and delinquency.                 We have relatively little information about criminal involvement                at the transition from adolescence to adulthood and virtually no                information relating contemporary factors at these ages to earlier              attitudes and behaviors.  Doing so allows for a fuller description              of criminal careers and extends theoretical understanding of                    factors associated with continution of or desistance from deviance.             The results of this research promise to influence the study of                  delinquency for years to come.",
