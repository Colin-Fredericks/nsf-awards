 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              experimental physical chemistry involving William Breckenridge                  and graduate students at the University of Utah and Benoit Soep                 and Christophe Jouvet at the University of Paris, Orsay.  The                   investigators propose to develop new techniques for probing the                 reaction dynamics of half collisions of electronically excited metal            atoms.                                                                                                                                                          Dr. Breckenridge brings to this collaboration his expertise in                  spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.  His laboratory has developed               the ability to synthesize complexes involving metal atoms with pure             hydrogen.  This is complemented by the French investigators'                    expertise and capabilities for conducting experiments involving a               pico-second laser system.  These experiments will provide                       information about physical and chemical processes that occur on                 the surfaces of metal atoms.  By extending their work to the pico-              second region, the investigators will be able to characterize some              of the slower dynamical processes which occur during atom/atom                  collisions.",
