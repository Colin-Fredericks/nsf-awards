 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to evaluate the processes responsible for              natural saline groundwaters in a regional carbonate aquifer--the                Edwards aquifer of Texas.  These waters are present in what is                  locally referred to as the badwater zone (salinities of greater                 than 1000 mg/1).  Despite the environmental importance of this                  aquifer and many previous studies here, hypotheses for the origin               and evolution of the badwater zone hydrochemical facies remain                  numerous and speculative.  This research will integrate a range of              conventional and newly developed analytical techniques in a                     hydrological and geochemical study of the Edwards aquifer both                  along and normal to the boundary between the badwater and                       freshwater zones.  The data base will include potentiometric and                major-element (rare-earth elements), and stable (H, O, B, S) and                radiogenic (Sr, Nd, U and Ra) isotope data that will be acquired                on new samples.  This study will also include petrologic and                    geochemical analyses of lower Cretaceous carbonate rocks that                   constitute the aquifer.  These data will be used in quantitative                models that simulate fluid flow, fluid-rock interaction, and fluid              mixing within aquifers.  The elemental and isotopic parameters to               be studied have a wide range of geochemical behavior, which will                be critical for the application of theoretical models to                        constraining the processes involved in the origin of each of five               distinct hydrochemical facies.  This study will bear on our                     understanding of regional flow systems in the Gulf of Mexico                    sedimentary basin, and will have broader implications for the                   chemical and structural controls on the development of regional                 carbonate aquifers and the evolution of saline groundwaters.",
