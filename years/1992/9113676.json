 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between James                    Weber, University of New Hampshire, and Dr. Michael Bernhard,                   Centro Richerche Energia Ambiente (ENEA), in La Spezia, Italy.                  ENEA is leading a major Swedish, German, and Italian study on                   environmental methylmercury concentrations.  Weber will work                    with Bernhard on the methylation and demethylation of mercury                   compounds in sediments.  The research will emphasize addition of                labeled inorganic mercury and methylmercury to sediment                         microcosms with the goal of understanding biotic and abiotic                    mercury methylation processes.                                                                                                                                  The results of the collaboration should provide increased                       understanding of mechanisms of mercury transformations, and of                  the sources and quantities of methylmercury in sediments, and their             transfer into the water and biota.  This knowledge could allow for              assessment of potential environmental hazards associated with                   methylmercury in biota.  In addition, this project would be an                  important initial step toward establishing a basis for estimating               methylmercury production and establishing environmental quality                 criteria for it.  Studies will be conducted under a variety of                  conditions including:  1) addition or no addition of mercury                    compounds, 2) inhibition or stimulation of certain bacteria, 3)                 aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and 4) addition or no addition of              potential methyl donors.  Weber will contribute to the project                  fundamental knowledge of chemical mechanisms involving                          organometallic compounds and experience in developing techniques                for determining low nanogram and picogram amounts of methyl-                    and butylin compounds in a wide variety of environmental samples.               ENEA personnel will contribute general knowledge of formation                   and demethylation of methylmercury in the Gulf of Genoa and the                 Ligurian Sea and rivers draining into them, expertise on biological             aspects of the processes, and considerable experience with use of               radioactive isotopes, and equipment for measuring them.",
