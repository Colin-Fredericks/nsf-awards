 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this study is to quantify complex reactivities of Fe-S               clusters in proteins.  These clusters perform numerous, diverse                 functions in nature.  A novel methodology will be used, exploiting              the unmediated voltammetry displayed by ferredoxins (small proteins             containing one or two clusters) at graphite electrodes in the                   presence of aminocyclitols.  Ferredoxins co-adsorb with                         aminocyclitols forming electroactive films.  This makes possible                highly economical, detailed studies involving film transfer between             electrolytes containing reagents that react with Fe-S clusters.                 Cluster oxidation levels are controlled, and reactions are                      monitored via voltammetric signals assigned to specific states by               EPR and MCD spectroscopy.  Some longstanding problems of studying               reactions of Fe-S clusters - very low reduction potentials, poor                spectroscopic signatures, instability and lability - are overcome.              Dr. Armstrong will characterize an unusual property of (3Fe-4S)                 clusters, the ability to undergo reversible, multiple electron and              proton uptake.  This property represents a dramatic departure from              the current belief that the protein environment permits only very               conservative changes in cluster oxidation level.  He will examine               the equilibria and kinetics of reversible metal ion uptake by (3                Fe-4S) to give (M3Fe-4S) in various proteins.  The likely existence             of clusters containing such ions as Zn will be assessed.  He will               compare the redox and ligand binding properties of various (M3Fe-               4S) clusters.  He will study the course of cluster assembly in                  proteins, from trace levels of Fe and S, and examine the fidelity               of this process in the presence of competing ions such as Zn.                   %%%                                                                             This study, exploring the characteristics of this important class               of compounds, will help to enlarge our understanding of oxidation               -reduction and electron transfer in life processes.",
