 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to restructure the General                          Experimental Psychology (GEP) course (60 percent non-majors;                    60% female enrollment) to give all students a more                              comprehensive, research-intensive view of psychology.  To                       accomplish this objective, five modules (each containing menus                  of projects that share common equipment and protocol) are                       designed to permit a greater number of projects and more                        individualized instruction.  Students will select projects from                 each module which are presented in a developmentally-oriented                   progression.  The initial modules offer group projects that are                 more prescriptive, obliging each student to practice skills                     that are necessary in later, more independent projects                          available in subsequent modules.  Computerizing and networking                  the laboratory will serve to increase the menu of available                     research projects and is the basis for a complete                               reorganization of this course into the core of a program                        designed to produce independent researchers.  It will enable                    students to design, conduct, analyze, write-up, and print                       research projects using the same equipment, often within the                    time limits of class sessions.  By presenting their projects                    during discussion sessions, all will benefit from a diverse                     view of each area of research.",
