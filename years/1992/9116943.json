 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicomponent seismic reflection, magnetotelluric,                        structural, and petrological studies of Basin-and-Range crust will              be performed to study problems of fluids in the crust including                 magma at the Moho, crustal inflow beneath uplifted core complexes,              underplating, mid-crustal detachment zones, anisotropy, and nature              of lower crust.  Structural plunge of the Ruby Mountains core                   complex,  producing greater than 10 km difference in level of                   exposure, offers a particularly good setting to study these                     problems.  The combination of S-waves as well as P-waves together               with conductivity in the deep crust provides a good opportunity to              constrain various possibilities suggested for Basin-and-Range                   crust, especially because seismic and MT results complement each                other in explaining conductive zones.  Data acquisition involving               about 1550 seismic channels is designed to optimize S-wave data for             maximum resolution, and the question of resolution in seismic and               MT interpretation is a major consideration in developing                        conclusions.  Models obtained from geophysical interpretation will              be integrated with petrology and structure.",
