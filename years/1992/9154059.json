 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deficiency in reading comprehension has become a critical                       national problem; workplace illiteracy costs billions of                        dollars in corporate retraining, industrial accidents, and                      reduced competitiveness.  Although intelligent tutoring                         systems could help, their inability to see or hear students                     limits their effectiveness in diagnosing and remediating                        deficits in comprehension.                                                                                                                                      This pilot project will test the feasibility of addressing                      this fundamental limitation by using a novel                                    interdisciplinary approach made possible by recent advances                     in high-speed computing, automated speech processing,                           reading research, and artificial intelligence.  It will                         monitor children's oral reading of elementary science                           material, using automated recognition of connected speech                       and prosodic features (such as hesitation and intonation) to                    extract information identified by teachers and reading                          experts as pedagogically useful.  Success will lay the                          foundation for follow-on work to exploit this information in                    interactive instructional software.                                                                                                                             The significance of this work includes opening a powerful                       new channel between student and computer based on two-way                       speech communication, enabling innovative tutorial                              applications in technical areas where comprehension is                          vital.                                                                                                                                                          Those affected include millions of children in grades 1-3,                      where oral reading is most important.  However, the results                     should apply to industrial training, adult illiteracy,                          English as a second language, and foreign language study.",
