 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem in developmental neuroscience is how individual               neurons acquire a constellation of idiosyncratic properties, such               as their location, shape, function and synaptic connections, that               define their uniqueness. This issue will be addressed in the                    nervous system of the leech embryo, a species that offers the                   advantages of having relatively few, stereotyped cells that are                 easily accessible to experimental manipulation.  The mechanisms by              which segmentally repeated patterns of neuronal development are                 modulated differentially among the 32 body segments to provide for              the specialized functions of the various body regions, such as the              head, the reproductive organs and the tail, will be studied.  The               hypothesis to be tested is that the segment-specific modulation of              the developmental pathway is the consequence of an intracellular                subdivision of an early embryonic precursor cell into sectors that              are differentially labeled with indicators of the future                        longitudinal body axis and are parcelled out in an orderly manner               to the daughter cells that found successive body segments.  Cells               in the embryo will be marked by intracellular injections and                    marking of the cell surface with cell lineage tracers.  Molecular               cell cloning technology will also be used to identify homeotic                  genes in the leech that may be involved in specifying neurons to                specific body segments.  The study of the mechanisms underlying                 neurogenesis in this simple nervous system promise to provide                   insights of general relevance to the understanding of nervous                   system development in more complex organisms.",
