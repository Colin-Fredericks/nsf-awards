While still the principal language of a few                 small villages in the Myagdi district of Nepal, the language is                 threatened and may cease to be the principal medium of                          communication in these villages in the near future.                                                                                                             The goal of the project is to prepare for publication a                         comprehensive grammar, a dictionary/thesaurus, and a collection                 of texts.  The grammar will be produced in a relatively non-                    theoretical, descriptive framework so as to be of maximum utility               to Sino-Tibetanists, anthropologists, and general linguists of                  various theoretical persuasions.  The grammar and                               dictionary/thesaurus will contain copious illustrations from both               elicted and textual material.  The texts will be chosen to                      exemplify several discourse types and a variety of cultural                     situations, will be accompanied by morpheme-by-morpheme glosses                 as well as translations into idiomatic English, and will be keyed               to the grammar.",
