 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the fifty years of social scientific examination of voting                   decisions in presidential elections, the mass media have been                   transformed; so too has the presidential election campaign.  In                 addition to newspapers and magazines; and the \"two-step flow\" of                news from opinion leaders to the mass public, we now have an array              of broadcast media that bring citizens virtually in direct contact              with the presidential campaign.  The historical political staple                of lengthy campaign speeches has been supplemented, if not                      supplanted, by 10-second \"sound-bites\" and elaborately produced 30-             second advertisements.  The campaign itself, which was once limited             largely to a fall contest between two major party nominees, now                 stretches through a calendar year, with voters taking a direct role             in nominations and the news media taking over the task of winnowing             the field of presidential candidates.                                                                                                                           Despite these changes in the campaign process, there have been few              studies that focus on how voters make sense of the new mass media               campaign, what information and understanding they acquire, and how              they decide to vote.  The bulk of scholarly attention has been                  concentrated on campaign coverage in prestige newspapers and                    network news, ignoring the role of advertising, and neglecting the              local newspapers and local TV news on which more and more Americans             depend on for information.  This investigation seeks to bridge this             gap by looking closely at voters and their media environment during             the 1992 presidential election campaign in four diverse                         communities:  Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts;                   Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and the twin towns of Fargo, North               Dakota-Moorhead, Minnesota.  These sites represent a range of very              small to very large media markets in each major geographic region               of the country.  Using a variety of methods, the researchers                    investigate how people in these diverse communities use campaign                news and political advertising, as well as their contacts with                  other people to arrive at voting decisions.                                                                                                                     Through content analysis of local newspaper and television news and             the political advertising broadcast in that media market, the                   investigators will compare and contrast the information that is                 most available to voters in their communities throughout the                    campaign.  Particular attention will be paid to the primary                     election phase.  Voter decision-making will be explored in public               opinion polls, focus groups, and periodic in-depth interviews with              representative panels of citizens in four communities throughout                the campaign season.  The aim of the project is to gain a fuller                understanding of the news media environment, and how citizens                   become interested in the campaign, acquire information, form                    impressions of the candidates, decide what is important, take                   positions on campaign issues, and, ultimately, decide how to vote.",
