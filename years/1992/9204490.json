 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator continues research on applications                        of dynamical systems ideas to problems in ecology and                           population biology, focussing on the notion of persistence and                  models of the chemostat.  The persistence theorem is studied in                 the context of reaction-diffusion equations and functional                      differential equations.                                                              The chemostat is a laboratory apparatus that is used                       in ecology to study exploitative competition.  (It is a model of                a simple lake.)  It is one place where both the mathematics and                 the biological experiments are tractable; all the parameters                    needed for the equations of the mathematical model are measurable               in the laboratory.  The basic model does not allow for the delat                between nutrient uptake by the organisms in the chemostat                       and reproduction (cell division).  A standard assumption in the                 model is that the tank is well stirred; hence there are                         differences in the amounts of nutrient present in different parts               of the tank. To study the effect of a nutrient gradient, another                device called the gradostat has been proposed by biologists.  The               mathematics of that device is now fairly well understood.                       Another way to induce a gradient is to allow the nutrient to                    enter the tank at one point and to diffuse along with the                       organisms.  The notion of persistence tries to capture the                      ecological idea that all components of a model ecosystem survive.               Such theorems have proved useful in the context of ordinary                     differential equation models; e.g., in the analysis of the                      gradostat and of a chemostat with an inhibitor.  The concept has                now found its way into the mathematical literature in a general                 form, in particular for an asymptotically smooth semi-dynamical                 system.  The aim of this project is to use the full potential of                the persistence theorem by applying it in an infinite dimensional               context, to reaction-diffusion equations and differential                       equations with delays.  If the assumptions about the chemostat                  are changed to remove the well-stirred hypothesis and to let the                nutrient and the cells move by diffusion or convection, then a                  reaction-diffusion equation or a gradostat results.  Delayed                    chemostat models have been studied, but no physiological                        mechanism has been introduced to account for the delay.  The                    obvious mechanism is the cell cycle, the time between nutrient                  uptake and cell division.",
