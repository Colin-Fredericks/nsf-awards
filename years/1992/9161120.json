 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pesticide use on plant crops pose long-term effects to human                    health and the environment.  The U.S. Forest Service, Pacific                   Northwest Region, in a Draft Environmental Impact Statement                     (1989) has adopted a pest management policy which gives                         preference to non-chemical control measures.  Reliable non-                     chemical control is not available for fungal root diseases of                   conifer seedlings, therefore chemicals remain in use.                           Environmentally safe strains of microorganisms can effectively                  protect plants from root diseases.  Furthermore, new methods have               been developed for coating seeds with these beneficial organisms.               As yet, these new technologies have not been applied to forest                  nurseries.  This research project will elevate biological control               organisms and current seed coating technology for biological                    disease control in barefoot forest nurseries.  The control of                   damping-off and root rot diseases of Douglas-fir by Pythium,                    Fusarium, Phytophthora and Cylindrocarpon will be elevated.  The                data obtained will assist in the production of a seed coating                   product which would be available to federal, state and private                  forest nurseries.  The product will be adaptable to food crops as               well as horticultural and ornamental industries.",
