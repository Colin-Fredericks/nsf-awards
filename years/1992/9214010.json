 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most Materials to which one is accustomed are infinite in size and              three-dimensional in character.  By this it is meant that their                 special dimensions extend over distances, in all directions, which              are much larger than relevant length scales.  An example of this                length scale is the interatomic distance.  In many circumstances,               however, such as at the point where a system undergoes a phase                  transformation, or at low temperatures, other, much larger length               scales become important.  Thus a system, which for most purposes                might look quite large becomes, under these circumstances, finite               and shows dramatic change in behavior.  Quantifying this change in              behavior is very important, since it goes to the heart of their                 understanding of the role of dimensionality both in terms of its                technological as well as its scientific implications.  Helium,                  because of a number of favorable circumstances, such as its                     superfluid properties, is an ideal system to study effects of                   confinement and the role of dimensionality.  This project consists              of a number of separate experiments, which, when completed, will                make a significant contribution to this understanding.",
