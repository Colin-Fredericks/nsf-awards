 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the second wave of a panel study of the                  American electorate begun with federal funds at the university of               the researchers.  The project identifies the distribution,                      stability and roots of segmented partisanship and assesses its                  impact on the way in which Americans think about and react to                   politics, political institutions, and candidates.                                                                                                               The role of political parties in ordering democratic institutions               and in framing electoral choice has not been seriously questioned               since political scientist E.E. Schattschneider proclaimed, in 1942,             that \" . . . modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the               parties.\"  Similarly, at the individual level, while its predictive             power has fluctuated over time, the centrality of party                         identification to any understanding of electoral turnout, vote                  direction, the assessment of candidates, the impact of issues, and              the role of ideology has never been seriously disputed.  If                     anything, the most productive research has enriched our                         appreciation of partisanship by demonstrating its                               multidimensionality.                                                                                                                                            The impact of federalism on the dimensionality of partisanship,                 however, has been largely ignored.  Research has emphasized the                 constancy of party identification within each citizen across levels             of government.  Because the scope and type of political decisions               often vary among levels of government, Americans may develop                    different expectations for the performance of government at                     different levels.  Hence, it is both logical and often appropriate              for voter approval, contempt, and indifference to be localized and              not fully generalizable across all levels of government.  Moreover,             when party programs and personalities are linked to level-based                 performance expectations, variation in citizen response to those                programs and personalities should be an expected, not a surprising,             outcome.  In short, it should be anticipated that people will                   respond differently to the different powers and purposes of                     national and state government.                                                                                                                                  This second wave of interviews in the panel study of the American               electorate involves 1,350 respondents selected using random-digit               dialing and random selection within households.  It should allow                greater understanding of the way in which Americans think about and             react to politics, political institutions, and candidates.",
