 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a student in                 cultural anthropology in a rural area of Cameroon.  The research                will investigate how people's perceptions of illnesses and                      treatment alternatives, and their evaluations of treatment                      results, influence their health-seeking behavior.  Most studies                 of health-seeking behavior examine how isolated beliefs correlate               with treatment behavior; in contrast this project analyzes the                  medical decision-making process.  The project will examine social               networks and group consensus using ethnography, formal and                      informal interviews, and relatively new analytical procedures in                cognitive anthropology to study how group agreement on                          categorizations and evaluations influence behavior.                                                                                                             This research is important because lay people in all societies                  have divergent \"popular models\" of illness and treatment, which                 sometimes support but often conflict with scientifically-derived                treatment regimes.  Understanding the importance of cultural                    factors in medical decision making in this one case will advance                our theoretical knowledge about compliance and health seeking                   behavior in general.",
