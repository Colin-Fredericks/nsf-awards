 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to explore force constraints as a               model of manipulator action.  Robotic manipulation is usually                   modeled in terms of programmed motion-goals are specified as the                motions of task objects, and robots are programmed by a sequence                of arm motions.  The programmed motion model works fairly well,                 provided that objects move only when rigidly grasped by the                     robot.  However, many robot operations violate this assumption,                 manipulating objects without a rigid grasp.  For example, when                  placing an object, the object may slip in the fingers.  Or, when                grasping an object, the object may be re-oriented and centered by               pushing and squeezing.  Other examples include striking, tilting,               and the use of passive compliances.  For these operations, and                  many others, the programmed motion model is awkward, because                    there is no direct transformation from desired object motions to                robot motions.  The research explores the use of task level force               constraints, as an intermediate level model of action.  A task                  level force constraint is any constraint on the force applied to                a task object.  For the operations where programmed motion is                   awkward, force constraints often provide a natural and effective                way to transform desired object motions to corresponding robot                  commands.  The approach is to build a planner, applying methods                 of classical mechanics to derive force constraints, and then                    using a variety of geometrical and analytical techniques to                     derive robots command parameters.  Experimental evaluation will                 use a industrial manipulator and vision system to perform                       positioning and assembly tasks in a planar task domain.",
