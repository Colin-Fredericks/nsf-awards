The workshop will cover all                                              aspects of advanced simulation of                                               electronic transport in                                                         semiconductors and semiconductor                                                devices, particularly those which                                               use large computational resources.                                              Topics will include: 2-D and 3-D                                                standard simulations (drift-                                                    diffusion, hydrodynamic equations),                                             Monte Carlo device simulations, and                                             Approaches to quantum transport.                                                The workshop is intended to be an                                               international forum for the                                                     discussion on the current trends                                                and the future directions of                                                    computational electronics.  A                                                   significant number of invited                                                   papers presented by speakers from                                               major universities and laboratories                                             in Europe an Asia will be included.                                             Plenary sessions will be followed                                               by poster presentations from US                                                 groups, to stimulate and contribute                                             to overall discussion. The emphasis                                             of the contributions will be on                                                 interdisciplinary aspects of                                                    Computational Electronics,                                                      encompassing Applied Physics,                                                   Engineering and Applied                                                         Mathematics. Active participation                                               of graduate students, including                                                 student poster papers, will be                                                  strongly encouraged.  The results                                               of the workshop will be                                                         disseminated in the form of                                                     proceedings.  In the  past Kluwer                                               Academic Publishers has efficiently                                             handled the printing of the                                                     proceedings which then where                                                    distributed to the participants                                                 within a few months after the                                                   meeting. Attempt to have similar                                                arrangements with a publisher to be                                             determined by university procedures                                             will be made.",
