 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of democracy requires that the outcome chosen by                     majority rule from among the set of available alternatives should               reflect the preferences of the voters in some meaningful way.  When             an outcome is said to be a \"majority rule winner\", no majority                  coalition should be able to imagine a different outcome that all                coalition members would prefer.  Procedural rules should simply be              neutral conveniences enabling a voting body to determine the                    majority rule winner efficiently and easily.                                                                                                                    Unfortunately, none of these desirable propositions is true in                  general for majority rule voting.  When voters have strong                      differences of opinion, then there may be no single alternative                 that can be chosen that reflects the \"will of the people\" in any                meaningful way.  For any possible selection, there will always be               some majority coalition that would prefer a different choice.  When             this is true, different procedural rules may lead to quite                      different outcomes simply by protecting favored outcomes from a                 majority coalition that would prefer a different choice.                                                                                                        It is troubling to realize that any possible democratic procedure               could determine the outcome in a way that is in some sense                      arbitrary and \"independent\" of the preferences of the voters.  But              if so, it is important to understand the effects of alternative                 procedural rules on democratic decisions.                                                                                                                       The proposed research conducts controlled laboratory experiments                in which subjects are paid amounts that vary with the alternative               selected from a two-dimensional grid.  Subjects have quite                      different preferences over the alternatives to be selected, but the             preferences are held constant from one voting body to another.  But             different voting bodies are allowed to vote over the alternatives               using quite different procedural rules.  Different rules determine,             for example, the procedure by which alternatives are introduced for             consideration and balloting.                                                                                                                                    If rules are simply neutral means by which voting bodies                        conveniently arrive at invariant outcomes, then the outcomes chosen             should not differ from one experiment to another.  However, early               experiments indicate clearly that different rules lead                          systematically to quite different outcomes, even though the                     preferences of the voters are held constant.  Different theories                make quite different predicitions about the outcomes to be selected             under different rules; with sufficient experimentation, it should               be possible greatly to increase our understanding of the effects                of the rules of the game on democratic choice.",
