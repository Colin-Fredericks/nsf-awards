 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aim is to extend and refine an innovative and                       promising application of intelligent tutoring systems developed                 collaboratively by the University of Pittsburgh's Economics                     Department and Learning Research and Development Center.  The                   methodology is a pioneering attempt at teaching major portions                  of the introductory microeconomics syllabus as a laboratory                     science.  The direction taken is likely to serve as a model for                 economics departments at other schools, given the way it                        addresses a pervasive dissatisfaction with the current methods                  of teaching beginning economics courses.  An important feature                  of the project is the vast amount of data which it will gather                  on student learning difficulties at the University of                           Pittsburgh and other college and universities.  Results derived                 from this project should reinvigorate what has been a declining                 interest over the past several years in instructional research                  on the post-secondary teaching of economics.",
