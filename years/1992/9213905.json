 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project, with Gregory Caldeira of the                   Ohio State University, to investigate the processes through which               transnational legal institutions acquire mass political legitimacy              and attain compliance with their decisions.  The project focusses               on the European Court of Justice, which is emerging as one of the               most powerful judicial institutions in the world, and is based on               a survey of the mass publics in the twelve nations of the European              Community.  The survey constitutes part of the Autumn 1992                      Eurobarometer.  Several hypotheses will be tested about the                     acquisition of legitimacy by transnational institutions, as well                as the consequences of that legitimacy for compliance with both                 national and international courts.                                                                                                                              The project is one of the first research efforts investigating                  processes of the acquisition and maintenance of the legitimacy of               transnational legal institutions.  The analysis will contribute to              the development of theories of institutional legitimacy through (1)             determining whether the theoretical frameworks are useful beyond                the confines of the nation-state;, (2) exploring the connections                between legitimacy and compliance, relying heavily on theories of               procedural justice; (3) testing a serious of conventional                       hypotheses about courts, legitimacy, and compliance for which there             are no previous comparative inquiries; (4) providing a benchmark                for future research into the processes through which institutions               acquire a reservoir of good will; and (5) contributing to the                   development of democratic theory by analyzing how courts contribute             to and profit from the legitimacy of transnational political and                legal institutions.  Overall, the project will contribute to                    prominent questions in comparative politics, the workings of legal              systems, and in international relations.",
