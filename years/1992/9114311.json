 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high resolution, time dependent, nonlinear, two-                         dimensional gravity wave model will be used in a series of                      investigations to understand the dynamics of gravity wave                       forcing, propagation, breakdown, and their role in modifying                    larger scale motions in the atmospehre.  These studies will use                 simulations of idealized flow situations to clarify basic                       dynamical processes in parallel with more realistic simulations                 to understand the magnitude and distribution of gravity wave                    effects in the atmosphere.  Our numerical studies will be guided                by estimates of mountain wave generation and propagation                        determined from NMC global wind and temperature analyses and                    global topographic data.  These investigations will also involve                use of observational data from the Flatland radar system as well                as NASA's aircraft experiments to verify model results.  The                    ultimate objectives of this project are to estimate the amount of               gravity wave flux escaping from the troposphere as a function of                mean flow conditions and topography and to develop                              parametrization schemes for gravity wave stress and transport to                be used in general circulation models.  Results from this                       investigation may also help to clarify the effect of small-scale                (less than 100 km) variability on the transport and microphysics                of aerosols and PSC's in the stratosphere.                                                                                                                           A second objective of the proposed research will be to                     investigate the dynamics of large amplitude atmospheric solitary                waves with a series of numerical experiments.  The PI's                         experiments will be guided by both theoretical analyses of                      solitary wave properties and by direct observations of                          atmospheric solitary waves from the Flatland Radar.  The PI's                   studies will be especially concerned with examining the                         sensitivity of solitary wave structure of the background                        atmospheric flow.",
