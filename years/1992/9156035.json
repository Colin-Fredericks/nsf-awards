These laboratory-oriented courses will be constructed                 to heighten interest in science by providing exciting and                       rewarding original research experiences in the fields of                        physical, analytical, and biological chemistry.  Carefully                      designed research experiences were chosen which (1) would be of                 interest to the scientific community, (2) utilize concepts and                  techniques comprehensible to a college freshman, and (3) are                    achievable in a limited time. One of the courses, Science                       Methodology, will engage the students in identifying and                        measuring physical/chemical data for submission to the CRC                      Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. In the second course,                        Preserving Genomes, students will construct genomic libraries                   from a wide variety of organisms, including endangered species,                 for possible inclusion in the American Type Culture Collection.",
