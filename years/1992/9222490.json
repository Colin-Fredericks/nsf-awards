This is a two part                 project consisting of the following:  Project A: scripting and                  filming an eight to ten minute video about the I/UCRC program for               use by IUCRCs for instructional and promotional purposes; and                   Project B: enhancing technology integration via the collection,                 cataloging and evaluating videos that describe the operations of                individual IUCRCs.  The video will address the following points:                1) How NSF/Industry/University Centers operate; 2) The advantages               of Center membership; 3) What happens at a Center's Industrial                  Advisory Board meeting; 4) Topics Centers address; and 5) Total                 number of Centers and what they do.  Project A will be designed                 to permit any I/UCRC to add material that describes their                       Center's work specifically and will be produced at UC-Berkeley,                 under the direction of Professor Richard White, Co-Director of                  the Berkeley I/UCRC.  In Project B, videotapes and related                      graphical materials highlighting I/UCRC research programs will be               solicited, collected, and analyzed, and classified and coded onto               an archival database.  From this video archive, a \"technology                   integration\" module will be prepared to supplement the \"IUCRC                   Showcase\" video of Project A.  Project B will be produced at the                University of Connecticut, under the direction of Professor Don                 Hempel, Evaluator for the I/UCRC for Grinding Research and                      Development.                                                                         The Program Director recommends that the University of                     California-Berkeley be awarded $118,977 for this project.                       Funding for this project will be as follows: $101,365 in FY 92 and              $17,612 in FY 93.",
