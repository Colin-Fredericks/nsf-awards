 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the participation of Dr.                                  S. A. Adediran of the Department of Chemistry,                                  University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria, in a                                     collaborative research project on the                                           enzymology of beta-lactam antibiotics in the                                    laboratory of Dr. Rex F. Pratt, Wesleyan                                        University, Middletown, Connecticut.  Previous                                  work by the PI's group has show that beta-                                      lactamases are inhibited by a series of                                         phosphonate monoester monoanions.  In this one-                                 year collaborative effort, a series of                                          phosphonate peptide analogs of these                                            phosphonate monoesters will be synthesized and                                  evaluated as inhibitors of DD-peptidases.   The                                 results promise to provide important                                            information on the DD-peptidase active site,                                    which could eventually lead to new routes for                                   designing antibacterial agents.                                                                                                                                 The collaborative research would extend Dr.                                     Adediran's experience in enzyme kinetics into a                                 more medicinal or pharmaceutical direction,                                     centered more on organic reaction mechanisms.                                   Such experience will improve Dr. Adediran's                                     teaching and research, and greatly enhance his                                  ability to initiate and coordinate future                                       inter-departmental research collaboration                                       between the College of Science and the College                                  of Medicine at the University of Ilorin.  The                                   project is consistent with the criteria for the                                 Science in Developing Countries (SDC) program                                   in that it strengthens collaboration between                                    U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                         counterparts in developing countries, and                                       increases the capacity of scientists and                                        engineers in developing countries to address                                    constraints to development.",
