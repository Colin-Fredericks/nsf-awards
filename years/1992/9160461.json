 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fullerenes, a new form of carbon with structures similar to                     those of a soccer ball, were first produced in late 1990.                       Because of their unique properties, many promising                              applications have been suggested; however, no matter how                        interesting their properties, development of the potential of                   fullerenes requires that large quantities be available at a                     relatively low price.  Although the currently conventional                      carbon-arc production method is simple to build and run at the                  laboratory scale, it is an inherently small-scale batch                         process, difficult to scale up, energy intensive, and very                      expensive.  TDA is therefore pursuing a combustion synthesis                    process as an approach to produce large quantities of low-cost                  fullerenes.  Combustion processes are continuous, easy to                       scale up, allow fine control of time-temperature history                        (important for optimization of product yield), have low                         capital costs, and use inexpensive hyrocarbon fuels as raw                      materials.  TDA has successfully isolated fullerenes from                       combustion soot and has developed thermodynamic models to                       predict the dependence of product yield on operating                            conditions which will be utilized in the experimental program                   to be carried out.  In the first phase of this program, TDA                     will investigate the effects of temperature, pressure,                          equivalence ratio, and input fuel composition in order to                       optimize the yield of fullerenes, and will use these data to                    analyze design and economics for the combustion route to                        fullerenes.                                                                                                                                                     Although fullerenes have been available for less than a year,                   many applications of this unique class of materials have been                   suggested.  For these applications, a low-cost source of large                  quantities of product are required.  Combustion processes are                   a preferred route due to relatively low energy requirements                     and their amenability to scaleup.  Major interest in this                       program has been expressed by chemical manufacturers.",
