 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complex aspect of chloroplast biogenesis is the pervasive                  involvement of postranscriptional processes within the organelle                that govern the formation of mRNAs for proteins of the                          photosynthetic apparatus.  We have isolated nuclear mutants of                  Chlamydomonas that do not accumulate chloroplast transcripts for                two light-harvesting components, CP47 and CP43, of Photosystem II               reaction centers.  Mutants 6.2z5 synthesizes, but does not                      accumulate, psbC mRNA while GE2.10 is defective in stabilization                of several transcripts from the psbB locus.  The mutants appears                to lack proteins that interact specifically with the mRNAs and                  function to protect degradation.  For GE2.10 however, it is also                possible the maturation of a polycistronic psbB transcript is                   impaired.  Our studies include: 1) completing sequencing of the                 psbB locus to elucidate the products encoded by this region of                  the alga's chloroplast genome and the occurrence of secondary                   structures that presumably specify transcript maturation of                     stabilization; 2) characterizing the primary transcripts and                    products of psbB; 3) analyzing proteins from purified                           chloroplasts from wildtype versus the mutant strains, that bind                 to RNAs from psbB and psbC subclones; 4) isolating of genes                     encoding the RNA-binding proteins by use of oligonucleotide                     probes or complementation of the mutant strains by transformation               with a plasmid library of wildtype nuclear DNA; 5) if time                      allows, assessing the roles of non-coding sequences of the psb                  transcripts by transforming chloroplasts of the mutants and                     wildtype with constructs of psbC gene fragments with psbB                       flanking regions (and vice-versa).                                              %%%                                                                             The photosynthetic apparatus of plants and algae is formed                      through the coordinated activities of two cellular compartments:                the chloroplast, where photosynthetic activities are                            compartmentalized, and the nuclear/cytoplasmic chambers where                   many regulatory and photosynthetic proteins are synthesized.                    Although chloroplasts can synthesize a many photosynthetic                      proteins, especially those involved in light energy conversion                  into chemical energy, they are not autonomous with respect to                   either their ability to generate functional photosynthetic                      complexes or with respect to the regulation of their                            photosynthetic and synthetic functions.  Our work concerns                      understanding how chloroplast gene expression is regulated by                   proteins imported from the cytoplasm.  We have found that nuclear               mutants of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, which unlike               vascular plants can easily grown by provision of simple                         carbohydrates, are defective in the accumulation of mRNAs                       encoding chlorophyll-binding proteins that are made in the                      chloroplast.  This project is to characterize the nature of the                 defect which causes the chloroplast gene products to be rapidly                 degraded after they are synthesized.  Our approach is to utilize                gene sequencing, biochemical and genetic means to resolve the                   nature of the proteins that normally interact with and stabilize                the chloroplast mRNAs.",
