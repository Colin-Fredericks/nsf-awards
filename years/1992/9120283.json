Schardl of the University of Kentucky to the laboratories of                    Professor David Berry Scott at Massey University and Dr. G. C. M.               Latch at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research                   (DSIR) both located in Palmerston North, New Zealand.  The                      objectives of the research visit are to elucidate the processes                 of endophyte evolution as related to host species and                           geographical locale, and to determine whether the sequence-based                phylogeny relates to biological characteristics such as                         morphology, host range and alkaloid profiles of the endophytes.                                                                                                 The study will make use of the collections of grass-endophyte                   association at Palmerston North.  The host collaborators have                   extensive research experience with endophytes (Latch) and                       molecular plant-microbe interactions (Scott).  Dr. Schardl will                 explore coevolutionary relationships among fungi and grasses                    using the tools of molecular systematics.  The mycosymbionts are                stably maintained for many host generations through seed                        dissemination.  The ecological and agricultural importance of                   these mycosymbionts stem from the benefits they confer to their                 hosts, including herbivore resistance and drought tolerance.",
