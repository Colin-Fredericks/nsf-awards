 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of carbenes and related reactive intermediates by laser                 flash photolysis will be conducted. Spectroscopic and kinetic                   measurements of these highly reactive intermediates in solution                 will be made. The research projects will include investigation                  of: (1) the properties of nucleophilic carbenes; (2) the                        kinetics of carbene/metal salt reactions (carbenoid formation);                 (3) the properties of \"push pull\" carbenes as well as pyridyl                   and pyridinium carbenes; (4) the effects of fluoro and methoxy                  substituents in modulating intramolecular carbene                               rearrangements; and (5) the fragmentation of oxycarbenes to                     carbocations. These studies will be of particular importance in                 providing insight and understanding for reactions that are                      characterized by low activation energy barriers.                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Robert A. Moss at Rutgers                          University. These studies will be centered around the                           production and reactions of carbenes, which are species that                    contain a carbon atom with two formal bonds rather than four                    bonds as found in stable carbon compounds. Carbenes are                         reactive intermediates that are very short-lived. Special flash                 laser techniques will be employed to observe these reactive                     intermediates and to study the rate at which they react.                        Carbenes can undergo reaction to give other reactive                            intermediates. For example, carbenes can react with lithium                     chloride to generate an adduct called a carbenoid with the                      normal complement of four bonds. With appropriate substitution,                 carbenes can give another reactive intermediate, a carbocation,                 which contains a carbon with three bonds and a net one unit of                  positive charge. These reactions will provide a means to study                  some of the important reactive intermediates in organic                         chemistry.",
