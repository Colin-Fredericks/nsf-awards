 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major problem in stellar astrophysics has been reconciling the                discovery that at least one half of the mature (main sequence)                  stars one sees in the skies are actually close double stars, or                 \"binary\" stars, whereas stars that are still forming, T Tauri                   stars, seem overwhelmingly to be single stars.  Thanks largely to               previous NSF-supported work by this Principal Investigator (PI)                 this discreprancy now seems clearly due to the difficulty of                    discovering binarity among very young stars from conventional                   spectroscopic techniques.  Working at infrared wavelengths, the PI              has used the moon as a \"knife edge\" to occult (eclipse) pre-main                sequence stars in the Taurus region of the sky to determine whether             they are single or double stars.  In the last few years he has                  found that 13/28 of occulted T Tauri stars are members of double                or triple star systems.  The PI proposes to extend this work to                 T Tauri stars in the Ophiuchus region of the sky as the Moon's                  orbit progresses southward over the next few years.  In addition                to adding to the statistics of young binary stars, the PI plans                 to observe some of the occultation events from two locations                    simultaneously, Hawaii and Kitt Peak.  This work is expected to                 clarify the conditions under which solar-type stars form binary                 stars as opposed to single stars with planetary systems.",
