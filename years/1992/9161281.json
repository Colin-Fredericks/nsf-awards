 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work centers on the development of reverse                    mode polymer dispersed liquid crystal materials.  These                         materials, which will be fabricated either as films or as                       encapsulated droplets, are radically different from other liquid                crystal devices, including normal mode polymer dispersed systems.               The important distinction of reverse mode materials is that they                represent an optically transmissive state in the absence of                     applied fields and are converted to an opaque light scattering                  state when a field is applied.  Their field-off/field-on behavior               is exactly opposite to that normally associated with optical                    properties of liquid crystal materials, thus giving rise to the                 reverse mode designation.                                                            There are numerous major and unique commercial opportunities               for these reverse mode polymer dispersed liquid crystal                         materials.  They include architectural use as \"smart windows\" for               energy savings in commercial and residential buildings; privacy                 windows in automobiles; and as a new approach to heads-up display               technology.  The unique feature of reverse mode materials with                  respect to these applications, as contrasted with other liquid                  crystal light shutters, centers on the fail-safe aspect in that                 they are transparent in the absence of an applied field.  Thus,                 unscheduled power outages will not create hazardous situations.                 The economic factors in commercialization would be most favorable               in that these reverse mode materials are relatively inexpensive                 to produce.                                                                          The focus of the phase I experimental effort is to improve                 the overall optical properties of reverse mode polymer dispersed                liquid crystal materials.  In particular, systematic studies will               be conducted to optimize the percent transmission of these                      materials in the transparent field-off state through modification               of the shapes and sizes of the liquid crystal microdroplets.",
