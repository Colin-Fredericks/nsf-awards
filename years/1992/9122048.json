 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular architecture of chromosomes remains one of the major                  mysteries of modern genetics.  In spite of impressive advances made             in learning the nucleotide sequence of chromosomes, the mechanisms              of packing functional DNA into the small space available is                     unsolved.  One organizing mechanism is supercoiling.  DNA is found              supercoiled in all organisms to about the same extent.  Another                 puzzle is the fact that only a fraction of the genetic information              is actively used at any instant.  Learning how DNA is organized in              both active and inactive regions of chromosomes is known as the                 domain problem. Bacteriophage MU is one of the most useful tools                for studying chromosome structure.  Mu is a transposon that                     randomly inserts itself into bacterial chromosomes and creates its              own supercoiled domain using host enzymes and proteins.  Further,               through novel Mu genetics, it was discovered that one of the most               abundant chromosomal proteins in E. coli, H-NS, supercoils DNA.                 DNA supercoiled by H-NS is inactive for transcription.  Thus, H-NS              is a prime candidate for organizing inactive supercoiled domains.               Experiments are designed to probe the structure of H-NS                         interactions with Mu DNA using genetic approaches as well as                    chemical and enzymatic probes and electron microscopy.",
