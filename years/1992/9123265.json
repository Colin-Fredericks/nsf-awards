 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research on questions                  related to ordinary and partial differential equations.  The                    research considers properties of solutions obtained by combining                global topological techniques with analytic tools. Work on                      ordinary differential equations focuses on systems, called                      Hamiltonian systems, which serve as models for the motion of                    finite systems of particles.  Since the 1970's there has been                   considerable progress in the study of periodic solutions of                     Hamiltonian systems through newly developed techniques growing                  out of the calculus of variations.  Current research will use                   past work in analyzing other types of global solutions (the                     periodic ones are the simplest, but there are others).  The                     solution paths, often called orbits, are much more difficult to                 treat because of the loss of boundedness.  Still, there is some                 promising preliminary work which can be pursued further.                             There are analogous questions which can be raised for                      semilinear elliptic partial differential equations.  Earlier                    research has led to the existence of solutions which do not                     change sign.  Although there is considerable literature on the                  subject now, the results say little about the nature of the                     solutions (e.g. how can one describe the rise and fall of                       solution surfaces?).  Work will be done on questions of this                    nature.",
