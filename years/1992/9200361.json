 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to Northern Arizona University to                     establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the                 areas of neural and behavioral sciences.  The research internship               is complemented by an integrated educational program that provides              training in research design statistics, reading complex scientific              literature, introduction to advanced technologies in research                   design and implementation, seminars in the history and philosophy               of science, and an integrated lecture-discussion series that covers             the range of research topics in neural and behavioral sciences.                 Scientists from the Department of Biology and the Department of                 Psychology will sponsor 12 internships for Native American                      undergraduate students.  The Department of Occupational and                     Technological Education and the Department of Engineering will                  provide training in advanced technologies, including basic computer             training and training in the application of computer assisted                   design systems for production of research software and                          instrumentation.  The Science and Mathematics Learning Center will              also provide training in the basics of experimental design,                     statistics, reading scientific literature, scientific and technical             writing, and collaborative learning.  Scientists from all                       participating departments will contribute lecture-discussion series             on neural and behavioral research.",
