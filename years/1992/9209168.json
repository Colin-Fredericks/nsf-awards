 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the optimal government               behavior using models that account for the imperfect control                    national or local governments exercise over the movements of                    individuals across their borders.  Three different models are                   developed each of which addresses a particular aspect of labor                  mobility.  The first analyzes the problems created by the                       inability of governments to keep migrants outside of their                      borders.  The analysis will identify cases in which attempts to                 restrict entry are inefficient from the viewpoint of the entire                 system of regions.  Inefficiencies of this type are becoming                    increasingly important not only within countries, but also in                   international contexts, such as in Western Europe as it enters                  into the 1992 Single Market initiative.                                                                                                                         The second model examines the optimal use of nonlinear income                   taxation to redistribute income within a region containing                      interregionally mobile individuals.  This research will bring                   together the literature on optimal income taxation and the                      provision of public goods.  The third model considers the                       situation where labor mobility among regions is costly and                      analyzes the ability of independent governments to redistribute                 income and maintain efficient allocation of labor across regions.               This project is important because it will provide a deeper                      understanding and new insights concerning the impact governmental               policy on labor mobility.",
