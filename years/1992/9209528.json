 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between hormones and behavior is no longer                     viewed as a simple unidirectional effect of hormones on behavior.               Rather, the view emerging from studies on animals observed in                   complex physical and social situations is that there is a                       sophisticated interplay between social contexts and hormonal                    status in the production of behavioral interactions.  The present               studies will further illuminate these relationships in                          callitrichid primates (marmosets and tamarins).  Dr. French has                 previously shown that social relationships within mated pairs are               extremely important in regulating the influence of hormones on                  behavior.  The current studies will evaluate the effects of other               social factors in modulating hormones effects on behavior.                      Specifically, Dr. French will assess whether or not responses of                tamarins to unfamiliar intruders differ as a function of the                    intruding or resident female's reproductive status, will assess                 whether or not reproductively suppressed subordinate females are                capable of expressing patterns of reproductive behavior when                    removed from the social context that produces suppression, and                  will evaluate the influence of visual access to unfamiliar pairs                on patterns of reproductive behavior across the ovarian cycle.                                                                                                  These studies are important in a number of ways.  First, the work               is relevant to propagation of endangered species.  All marmosets                and tamarins are considered threatened or endangered, and for                   some species (e.g., lion tamarins) there are more individuals in                captivity than in the wild.  It is highly likely that information               critical for the enhancement of the propagation of these species                in captivity will be the direct result of these studies.  Hence,                this research may have a profound impact on the maintenance of                  the biodiversity of tropical animals.  Second,these studies will                show how complex social settings can influence (reduce or                       magnify) the effects of internal physiological functions on                     behavior.  These findings as a whole will contribute to a more                  complex and realistic view of hormones and behavior.  Finally,                  these studies will evaluate hormone-behavior relationships in                   species of primates that have a social system with many common                  features of human societies (e.g., high degree of cooperative                   behavior, joint rearing of offspring, residence of older                        offspring in family or social groups).",
