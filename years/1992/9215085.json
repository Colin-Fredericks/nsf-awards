An experimental search assistance method is enhanced for greater  effectiveness by: 1) replacing the textually oriented user  interface with a graphically oriented user interface (GUI), and 2)  extending the underlying search models to serve as a basis for  assistance for searching in general databases with a verbal  indexing character as well as in bibliographic databases.  The  enhanced system is tested on a variety of experimental users to  determine how well the GUI aids the user by encapsulating the  conceptual representation of the user's problem and guide in the  generation, execution, evaluation, and modification of the  multiplex search strategies needed to facilitate efficient and  effective searching.  The tests compare results from bibliographic  and full text, and other non-bibliographic databases, as well as  for different modalities of user interfaces, ranging from highly  user-directed interactions to highly automated or system-directed  modes, where user initiatives may be limited to an initial problem  statement and a minimal amount of relevance feedback on retrieved  documents.",
