 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the national importance of increasing the number of                       minority students who persist in math, science, engineering,                    premedicine, and predentistry, Phase I investigated why some                    such students follow through with their plans to major in                       MSE fields and others do not.  Data were retrieved from the                     1985 College Board files of 5,602 students with SAT math                        scores of 550 or above.  All were minority students except                      for a comparison sample of 404 White students.  (In Phase                       II, 688 Asian American students were added.)  In 1987, a                        first followup was conducted.  Sixty-one percent of the                         minority students had enrolled in college and were majoring                     in MSE, in comparison with 55% of the White students and 70%                    of the Asian American students.  In Phase III, a booklet                        based on the results was prepared for high school students.                     In Phase IV, the original sample was resurveyed, five years                     after high school graduation.  Fifty-four percent were still                    studying or employed in MSE fields.  The purpose of Phase V                     will be to conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the                     entire data file, including path analyses with corrections                      for attenuation, as well as logistic regressions to predict                     the probability that a student with a given academic and                        personal profile will persist in MSE.  Models will be                           developed and tested on the sample as a whole and for each                      gender-by-ethnic group, so far a sample sizes permit, and                       for scientists, engineers, and M.D.s separately.",
