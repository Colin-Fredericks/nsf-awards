 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geomorphic processes, climate, soils, and biota work on a                  large scale to create the observed physical landscape.  At a                    microscale, weathering contributes as part of the geomorphic                    system, and an important objective of weathering research is the                development of models that explain and predict rates of chemical                reactions at the earth's surface.  Quartz is among the most                     common of terrestrial minerals, and it is regarded as one of the                most resistant to chemical weathering.  The processes of quartz                 weathering is not as well understood as those associated with                   other, more weatherable materials.  This project seeks to                       understand how quartz decrystallization, a micro-weathering                     phenomenon, is influenced by climate, biota, geochemistry, and                  time.  It will also determine a chemical signature for quartz                   decrystallization that may be useful for paleo-environmental                    research.  The project will sample quartz from a constant                       geomorphic environment and time, but with varying climate and                   vegetation.  Field analysis combined with laboratory                            microanalytical techniques will be used to quantify the physical                and chemical characteristics of quartz decrystallization.  These                characteristics will be compared with time, temperature,                        moisture, geochemical environment, biochemical environment,                     geomorphology, and scale by means of statistical tests.                              This research will define the elements of quartz                           decrystallization, and it will contribute to a greater                          understanding of weathering processes as a whole.  This is                      important because weathering processes are closely connected to                 geomorphic processes, soil development, and sedimentology.  The                 findings should also amplify the importance of quartz in                        geochronology, paleo-environmental research, and archaeology.",
