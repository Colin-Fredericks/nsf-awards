 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for a better understanding of the relation between                hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods) and long term climatic                variability is underscored by concerns of anthropogenic climate                 change.  Investigations into these relations using closed basin                 lakes and their basin hydrology are proposed.  The Great Salt Lake              basin is arid and heterogeneous.  Its climatic signal is well                   correlated with the Western U.S.                                                     Recent climate research into sources of determinism (e.g.                  ENSO) in global climatic variability has been very fruitful.  Such              research has blossomed through creative data interpretation, and                modeling of feedbacks and interactions.  The proposed research is               in the same spirit.  On interest is the identification of                       persistent climatic anomalies, their generating regimes; the                    aggregate basin hydrologic response and feedbacks; transitions                  between regimes; their sensitivity to initial conditions and                    parameters, and to dynamic changes in forcing functions.  A                     nonlinear dynamical systems perspective is adopted.  Nonparametric              methods for data analysis and systgm identification are proposed.               Physical and data based arguments for the possibility of chaotic                behavior in the coupled lake-basin-climate system, and the presence             of multiple regimes are advanced.  The development of finite                    physical-statistical-dynamic models to study system sensitivities               is proposed.",
