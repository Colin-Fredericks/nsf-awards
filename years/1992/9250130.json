Experiments are designed so                    that students use the new instrumentation to make                               transpiration, leaf area, and photosynthetic measurements on a                  number of different plants grown under a variety of different                   environmental conditions in both the laboratory and field.  In                  each experiment the instrumentation will provide a means by                     which students can:  (1) formulate and test hypotheses related                  to important physiological and ecological concepts; (2) gain                    hands-on experience with state-of-the-art equipment; (3)                        conduct experimentation which reinforces important                              physiological and ecological principles; (4) examine the proper                 methods of experimental design; (5) gain first-hand experience                  in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of scientific                   data; and (6) report on the experimentation in a scientific                     journal format.",
