During the first week of the summer program all participants will               attend overview presentations and laboratory sessions on scientific             principles, research methodology and pertinent ethical issues in                the three disciplines.  Week 1 will also include a session on                   mathematics topics related to the science programs.  During Weeks               2 and 3 the students will divide into groups of eight; each small               group will work on intensive research projects over the two-week                period in environmental chemistry, digital logic and computer                   interfacing, or the physics of the electromagnetic spectrum.                    Findings from these research projects will be presented to the                  entire group of Young Scholars at the end of the summer program.                Career exploration for all participants will include field trips,               guest speakers, and use of the informational resources of the Saint             Vincent College Career Development Center.  An \"Ethics in Science\"              forum will be the capstone activity for study and discussion of                 ethical issues surrounding the program's three disciplinary areas.",
