 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the cyclical behavior                of small versus large firms, and to understand the differential                 response of the two kinds of firms with respect to monetary                     policy.  The long run objective is to assess the importance of                  recent theories which emphasize the role of credit market                       imperfections in the propagation of business cycles and in the                  monetary transmission mechanism.  The focus on cross-sectional                  differences in firm behavior at different stages of the business                cycle exploits that idea that small firms are more likely than                  large firms to face problems getting credit.                                                                                                                    The empirical work centers on examining panel data on real and                  financial firm variables provided by the Census Bureau.  Data is                available for firms in the manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail               trade, and mining sectors.  An important difference with existing               panel studies of firm behavior is that the sample distribution of               firms is highly representative of the true firm population within               each sector.  In particular, small firms are more accurately                    represented.  The representative nature of these data will                      facilitate drawing inferences about the relevance of the results                for macroeconomic behavior.  An objective is to quantify the                    impact firms facing financial constraints have on the aggregate                 volatility of output, inventories, and investment.  This research               is important because it will provide a better understanding of                  the interaction of small firm behavior and the business cycle.",
