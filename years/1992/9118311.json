 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Kathryn F. Lanoue              of Pennsylvania State University Hershey Medical Center and Jerzy               Duszinski of the Nencki Institute of Warsaw, Poland, is to identify             and characterize the transporter which catalyzes hormone dependent              influx of extracellular calcium into liver cells.  The researchers              will study fura-2 loaded hepatocytes in primary culture, using a                fluorescence digital imaging system in conjunction with whole cell              patch clamp microinjection techniques, to determine the current                 voltage relationships of the putative calcium channel, as well as               the enthalpy of calcium influx and its Ph dependence.  Preliminary              experiments indicate the calcium transport into the cell is not                 dependent on hormone occupancy of calcium mobilizing receptors in               the plasma membrane, or on IP3 levels in the cell but it is                     dependent on the extent of depletion of intracellular hormone                   releasable calcium stores.  Calcium depletion of these stores                   stimulates calcium entry into the cell, in a graded manner.  The                researchers will test the hypothesis that a calcium sensitive                   enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum elaborates and releases to the              cytosol a metabolite which regulates plasma membrane calcium                    permeability.  They will design experiments to demonstrate the                  existence of such a diffusible metabolite and to characterize it.               The researchers plan to use an inhibitor of the calcium plasma                  membrane transporter as a means to monitor calcium transporter                  activity in hepatocyte plasma membrane vesicles loaded with fura-2.             They will use the vesicular assay system to screen the influence of             putative regulators and as a basis for later solubilization,                    reconstitution, and purification.                                               %%%                                                                             This project in biology fulfills the program objective of advancing             scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United                  States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool             resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
