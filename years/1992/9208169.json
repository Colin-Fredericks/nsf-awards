 "awd_abstract_narration": "Open-canopied jack pine and jack spruce stands, in which                   reindeer lichens comprise a significant component of the ground                 cover, occur on dry, nutrient-poor sites throughout northwestern                Ontario.  These lichen woodlands are predominantly fire produced.               With the suppression of forest fire and the continued northward                 movement of logging activity in northwestern Ontario, timber                    harvest is replacing fire as the most prevalent cause of large-                 scale disturbance in the lichen rich forests of the region.                     Although the effects of forest fire on reindeer lichens and                     patterns of terrestrial lichen succession are well-documented,                  little is known about how timber harvest affects reindeer lichens               or about post-harvest reindeer lichen regeneration.  This study                 will examine changes in biomass, percent cover, species                         composition, and growth rates of reindeer lichens that survive                  timber harvest in lichen woodlands and those that colonize                      harvested sites on two soil types in several regions of                         northwestern Ontario.  Sampling will cover five time-since-                     disturbance classes for different sites.  Data will be                          statistically analyzed for differences in biomass, percent cover,               growth rates and species compositions of reindeer lichens on                    sites of various age classes, disturbance types, and soil types.                Results of this research will provide an increased understanding                of the rate at which reindeer lichens survive timber harvest, the               rate of recovery of lichen biomass on harvested sites, and the                  roles of lichens that survive and colonize harvested sites in                   post-harvest recovery.                                                               The effect of timber harvest on lichen abundance is                        significant because of the importance of reindeer lichens to                    woodland caribou.  Woodland caribou winter in lichen woodlands                  and feed on the reindeer lichens.  Destruction of habitat and the               associated decrease in reindeer lichen availability has been                    proposed as a cause of the decline in caribou numbers.  The                     findings from this study will elucidate some of the processes in                reindeer lichen recovery following fire and harvest, and they                   will inform management policy of woodland caribou for whom                      reindeer lichen are the primary winter fodder.",
