 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomarkers are compounds in geologic samples whose basic carbon                 skeleton resembles that of their precursors which occur in source               materials such as algae, bacteria and higher plants.  For the most              part the biomarkers discovered to date have been in the C10-C40                 range.  Limitations in both chromatography and mass spectrometry                in the past, have prevented the successful investigation of                     biomarkers in the region above C40.  In the past two years we have              taken advantage in the development of high temperature capillary                columns and tandem mass spectrometers to enter into the frontier                area of biomarker geochemistry in the range of C40-C100.  Extracts              from a variety of samples have been investigated by tandem mass                 spectrometry in combination with gas chromatography or the direct               insertion probe.  Tandem mass spectrometry has been used in                     combination with micropyrolysis techniques to investigate the high              molecular weight fragments produced by pyrolytic degradation of                 kerogens and asphaltenes.  This work has clearly demonstrated the               presence of complex mixtures of high molecular weight components                in a wide variety of samples.  These compounds are dominated by                 n-alkanes and alkylclohexanes extending to at least C100.  In                   addition to analytical limitations, another reason why these                    components have not been investigated as thoroughly as components               below C40 is that in many cases their low volatility precludes their            presence in crude oils collected at the well head for example.                  Furthermore the low volatility of these components also means it                is possible that they may not necessarily occur in the saturate                 fraction containing compounds below C40.                                        The present goal is to investigate how these molecular weight                   compounds are formed.  In some preliminary experiments we have                  shown that artificial maturation of fatty acids will lead to                    polymerization of these compounds to form high molecular weight                 alkanes, cyclohexanes and complex mixtures of alkylated                         naphthalenes.  It is proposed to expand these experiments and                   perform them with a variety of lipids, as well as naturally                     occurring organic material such as higher plant material and algae,             in the presence and absence of catalysts, such as bentonite, and                at a variety of temperatures.  Preliminary experiments have also                been conducted in the presence of elemental sulphur and it has been             shown that sulphur is incorporated into many of these reaction                  products.                                                                       Although similar maturation experiments have been                               performed previously, the earlier experiments were typically                    designed to examine thermal degradation products and not                        polymerization products.  The work described herein will provide                us with information on the way in which these high molecular                    components may be produced and conditions under which these                     compounds will be formed.",
