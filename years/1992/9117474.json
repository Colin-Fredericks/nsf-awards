 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1979, the resurgent dome of Long Valley caldera,                     California has risen more than 50 cm apparently  due to the                     injection of 0.2 km3 of magma at depths.  Several earthquakes (>6.0)            accompanied the initial uplift; the USGS has warned of possible                 eruptive activity.                                                                   Floodplain evidence from the Owens River suggests that the                 current uplift is part of a long term inflation that may total 15-              35 meters.  Most of the lower river displays two recent parallel                meander belts (200-300m apart), similar in meander wavelength and               amplitude, but unequal in age.  The older, invariably closer to the             dome and 30-60 cm higher in elevation, now carries an underfit                  stream and is being abandoned.  The new lower channel formed by                 avulsion, apparently triggered by uplift.  As many as four older,               separate meander belts exist and suggest that two cycles of uplift              and subsidence may have preceded the current inflation.                              The proposed research would involve the following                          investigations.  (1) We will make a series of detailed leveling                 surveys perpendicular to the valley axis to define the pitch of the             interfluvial surface as an estimate of domal uplift, (2) We will                determine ages for oxbow sediments from the several meander belts               using a combination of tephrochronology and 14C (forest fire                    charcoal and possible peat) to define the length of time that the               river occupied each of these meander belts.  These ages will help               define both the times of uplift and subsidence as well as the                   possible correlation between river channel migrations and eruptive              activity in the Inyo and Mono Crater fields.  (3) We will compare               historic and modern photographs of the river to determine recent                rates of channel migration and compare them with the local degree               of floodplain tilting determined in the leveling surveys.                            An understanding of the recent history of the resurgent dome               is of central concern to residents of Mammoth Lakes, CA.  The                   proposed investigation offers undergraduate students an excellent               opportunity to study both in the field and in the laboratory an                 important example of silicic volcanism, as well as an interesting               phenomenon in fluvial geomorphology.",
