 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.                                              The objective of this Phase I project is to develop a                      cost-effective multiwavelength local area network based  on                     combining the best attributes of both wavelength-division                       multiplexing and Fiber Distributed Data Interface into a unique                 network referred to as Highly Parallel Wavelength Distributed Data              Interface (HPWDDI).  The research emphasis is on the technological              choices and economic evaluation of the physical layer                           implementation.  An exploratory multi-channel single-mode HPWDDI                system is being designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate the                feasibility of the concept and its capability for interactive                   multimedia communications.",
