 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central issue in developmental neuroscience is the identification             of molecules that guide nerve cells during axonal growth and final              target recognition.  Molecular genetics will be used to identify                genes in the fruit fly that code for cell-surface labels or other               molecules which neurons use to recognize specific pathways and                  synaptic partners.  The subjects are eight large neurons mediating              the escape response in the fruit fly.  These neurons have been                  extensively characterized physiologically and anatomically.  Mutant             flies have been developed in which specific connections between                 these neurons are disrupted.  The mutation, Pas, blocks a key link              in the escape response.  This gene has been cloned.  Some mutations             in the region of the Pas gene are lethal, while others cause only               neurological defects.  The relationship between these two phenomena             will be studied.  Two transcripts have been found in the Pas                    region.  A molecular analysis of these transcripts will be                      undertaken to determine the basis for lethal or neurological                    defective development.  These studies promise to provide                        information generally relevant to the molecular mechanisms                      regulating the development of synaptic specificity.",
