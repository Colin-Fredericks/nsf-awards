 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of the investigation is the development of an                  efficient method for the preparation of cadinane                                sesquiterpenes, which comprise a growing class of                               biologically-active natural products.  Two different                            approaches, both of which employ a stereospecific beta-lactone                  rearrangement as the cornerstone transformation, will be                        examined, and their relative strengths assessed and compared.                   Each protocol will be investigated, first with model systems,                   and with particular attention to stereochemical control.  The                   total synthesis of several naturally-occurring,                                 butenolide-containing cadinanes will then be attempted, using                   appropriately designed starting molecules.  The first route,                    although longer, offers the greatest potential for unequivocal                  stereochemical control.  However, if the second route exhibits                  high stereoselectivity in the key beta-lactone-forming step,                    its considerable brevity will bode well for wide application.                   Both routes allow for asymmetric syntheses by using optically                   enriched starting materials.                                                    %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. T. Howard Black at Eastern Illinois University,                 which is an undergraduate institution.  The research will apply                 the beta-lactone/gamma-lactone rearrangement of the synthesis                   of the cadinane class of sesquiterpenes.  This should provide a                 stimulating introduction and training of undergraduate students                 in research, besides producing new syntheses of the challenging                 cadinane class of molecules.",
