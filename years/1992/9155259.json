 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program, which builds upon the success of a                 previous teacher enhancement effort, is to develop a leadership                 program that can serve as a national model for dissemination of                 knowledge and pedagological techniques in the subject areas of                  The Nature of Science and Evolution. The objectives of this                     program are 1) to improve the quality of instruction of the                     nature of science and evolution; 2) to encourage and enable                     biology teachers to begin with these matters and to integrate                   them throughout the biology course; 3) to demonstrate how the use               of humans as biological examples can enhance student interest and               learning; 4) to assist teachers in developing a more dynamic                    teaching methodology. Applications will emphasize a shift in                    laboratory focus toward exploratory activities. In addition the                 use of cooperative learning, concept mapping, and textbooks as                  reference sources will be encouraged.                                                                                                                           Specifically, 890 teachers from the mid-western and western                     United States will participate in the program. The objectives                   will be accomplished by three distinct, but related, program                    elements.  First, 30 teachers per year will participate in an                   \"Evolution and the Nature of Science Institute\" (ENSI) and two                  followup sessions, to be held at San Jose State University (SJSU)               for the first three years of the program. Second, six teams of                  lead teachers will be selected and trained in a \"Lead Teacher                   Preparation Program\" (LTPP), during each of the first three years               of the program. Third, the lead teacher teams will present two-                 week satellite ENSIs (SENSIs) during the second through fifth                   years of the programs. It is proposed that 40 SENSIs be held, for               twenty teachers each, at sites throughout the midwest and western               United States.                                                                                                                                                  The total cost share of this program is estimated to be 42 % of                 NSF cost.",
