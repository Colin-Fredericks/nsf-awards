 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and disease susceptibility are                 associated with a mitochondrial gene, T-urf13, which is carried by              the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of maize.  T-urf13 encodes             a 13-kilodalton protein, URF13, which is located in the inner                   mitochondrial membrane.  The fungal pathogens, Bipolaris maydis                 race T and Phyllosticta maydis, produce pathotoxins that are                    responsible for the virulence toward cms-T maize.  Mitochondria                 from cms-T are specifically sensitive to the pathotoxins;                       sensitivity is caused by a toxin-URF13 interaction that mediates                pore formation in the inner mitochondrial membrane.  T-urf13 is                 correlated with CMS by the molecular analysis of cms-T revertants               and the effects of fertility restoration.                                                                                                                       Nuclear and mitochondrial transformation experiments are proposed               to test the relationship between T-urf13 and CMS.  Standard and                 mutated URF13s are used to study their effects on CMS and to                    determine the structural elements of URF13 relevant to CMS.  The                effects of URF13 mutation on CMS and toxin sensitivity are compared             to determine if the two traits rely on a common structure and                   mechanism.  A maize mitochondrial transformation system is proposed             that is based on the toxin-sensitivity response of T-urf13 and                  particle bombardment.  The pathotoxin-URF13 interaction will be                 investigated to learn how URF13 forms a membrane pore.***//",
