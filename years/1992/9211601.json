 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Richard Leventhal, Mr. Brandon Lewis                 will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Building on                    previous fieldwork he carried out in the region, he will conduct                archaeological excavations at the site of El Pedernal which is                  located in the northeastern Peten region of Guatemala. The site                 and its surrounding environs formed part of the Tikal Mayan                     empire and was occupied during Early and Late Classic periods.                  Thus it documents the height of Mayan achievement. Work to date                 has demonstrated the presence of a number of plaza groups and                   habitation sites. Mr. Brandon will conduct limited excavations at               several of these to collect lithic remains. He will relate the                  distribution of such materials to the chert sources from which                  they are derived. Through analysis of the production sequence,                  which can be reconstructed from the byproducts recovered, he will               gain insight into the organization of stone working at the site.                                                                                                While archaeologists have traced the rise and subsequent decline                of the Mayan empire, it is still uncertain how it functioned and                how large numbers of individuals were integrated into this large                entity. In recent years attention has been focussed on the                      economic system and attempts made to understand the degree of                   economic specialization. Because metal tools were not available,                stone played an important role in Mayan subsistence and Mr. Lewis               will attempt to understand the degree to which stone tool                       production was either centralized or dispersed in the hands of                  local users.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light                 on how complex societies developed and were maintained and will                 assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
