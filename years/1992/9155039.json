Students will participate in research at laboratories affiliated                with Boston University and MIT, where they will be placed for six               weeks during the summer after either their sophomore or junior                  years.  This age group is chosen because of its maturity and its                ability to share the summer experience with fellow high school                  students during their senior year.  This program for high-ability               secondary school students will be coordinated by Boston University,             where the participants will live for the duration of the project.               The object of this program is for the students to become aware of               the realities of a scientific career through involvement in                     research and exposure to questions at the frontiers of knowledge                and to the methods and ideas used to answer them.  To this purpose,             each participant will be paired with a mentor -- a person actively              engaged in research -- and will work with him or her in ongoing                 research problems.  A series of weekly seminars will provide a more             global view of problems in science.",
