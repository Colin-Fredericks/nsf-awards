 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers have attracted considerable interest world wide because             of their versatility as a tool for many scientific and engineering              applications such as processing and synthesis of materials.  Among              various applications of laser, Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition                  (LCVD) and Laser Physical Vapor Deposition (LPVD) techniques can                be used to synthesize thin layers of materials with precise spatial             control.  Although the potential of Laser Induced Deposition (LID)              processes as a superior technique to produce thin films has been                demonstrated, little has been done to understand the fundamentals               of such processes.  For this reason, a research project                         encompassing experimental studies and development of mathematical               models for the film forming process during LID for a compound such              as Titanium Nitride (TIN) is researched in order to understand the              mechanism of such processes, and to develop a science base for                  laser-aided materials processing.  Morphology and stoichiometry of              TiN deposits for both LPVP and LCVD will be a major interest.  TiN              is chosen as the model material for the study for its wide                      application in various industries such as microelectronics, opto                electronics, tool and aerospace industries.  Applications of TiN                thin films as a diffusion barrier between Si and Al (for VLSI) is               often observed.  The experimental studies include the determination             of optical and electronic properties and characterization by                    various electron-optical techniques for TiN films formed by LID.                The surface temperature and chemical composition near the point of              deposition will also be determined.  These results will be used to              obtain information about the surface-decomposition fraction and                 the cluster size in the film.  The chemical kinetic data will shed              light on the reaction rate law in the vapor phase during LPVD and               at the gas-solid interface during LCVD, and on the question of                  enhanced reaction rate during LID.  Along with the experimental                 works, mathematical studies will be carried out by considering                  continuum mechanics for deposition at a high ambient pressure, and              by using the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation or molecular dynamics (MD)             technique for deposition at a low ambient pressure (Ultra High                  Vacuum, UHV) to model particle transport with chemical reaction                 during LID.  MC or MD simulation can also be utilized to predict                the cluster size, and its effect on the film quality.  Such models              will be useful to determine the important process parameters, to                predict the performance of the LID systems, to design and optimum               LID system with optimum control.                                                     The researched work may allow the improved control laser-                  based thin film deposition processes for semiconductor processing               and the production of wear-resistant coatings.",
