 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to fully utilize the transmission capacity of                          transmission lines, significant advances need to be                             achieved in power system control as applied to the                              damping of low-frequency electro-mechanical                                     oscillations.  Power system stability characteristics                           generally restrict the maximum allowable power                                  transfers at thermal limits of the lines.  The stability                        characteristics of power systems depend on                                      damping devices and damping control strategies                                  employed.  While there are many devices that can                                be used in power systems to achieve damping, the                                strategies that are currently used to control these                             devices generally do not provide enough stability                               enhancement to enable operation near thermal                                    limits.  The development of better damping control                              strategies for large power systems is the focus of                              this research.  This research concerns two related                              areas: 1) improved methods for power system                                     identification to aid uncertainty model description;                            and 2) robust control methods that include these                                uncertainty models to dampen electro-mechanical                                 power system oscillations.  To improve power                                    system damping over a set of operating points,                                  methods of system transfer-function identification                              are needed which can account for non-zero initial                               conditions and noise.  Transfer-function uncertainty                            models also need to be generated and included                                   appropriately in robust controller design method.                               Two main goals of this research  are: 1) to develop                             improved methods of identifying system transfer                                 functions and uncertainty models under conditions                               where power system faults result in significant                                 system changes and where post-fault system                                      transfer-function identification must be                                        accomplished in the presence of both power system                               noise and initial conditions on lightly damped                                  modes of oscillation; and 2) to investigate and                                 extend recent advances in robust multivariable                                  control theory to obtain improved power system                                  damping controller design method, methods that                                  accommodate the transfer functions and uncertainty                              models obtained under 1 above.",
