 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimating the likelihood of future events is a critical aspect of              making a variety of managerial decisions.  A predominant finding in             prior research is that individuals are overconfident.  This                     Research Planning grant is to develop a research plan seeks to                  theoretically investigate why overconfidence occurs by drawing upon             prior work on how cognitions are used in decisions.  The focus of               this research is on comparing the effects of evaluative and outcome             feedback, the underlying attributional process that is invoked and              the moderating effect of expertise.                                                                                                                             Four separate experiments will be designed.  Each experiment will               be comprise three stages and data will be gathered using an                     interactive computer program.  The manipulated experimental                     variables will consist of evaluative feedback, nonevaluative                    feedback, attributions, and expertise; while there will be repeated             measures on item domain.  Subjects will perform the judgment task               in the context of making a strategic plan.                                                                                                                      The research requires planning activities such as theory                        development, development of experimental stimulus,                              operationalization of independent factors, and identification of                experimental procedures.  The proposed research will contribute to              existing knowledge on the overconfidence bias and isolate                       conditions when it can be reduced.  It will foster research on                  overconfidence in an application context (i.e., marketing and                   strategic planning) where there are likely to be tangible benefits.",
