 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to investigate methods for building self-timed                  circuit modules in a gallium arsenide (GaAs) process that are                   suitable for assembling into larger systems that also exhibit self-             timed behavior.  Gallium arsenide holds great promise for                       implementing extremely high performance integrated circuits but                 this speed also makes system design difficult.  Systems designed                using these modules can be faster, more robust, and easier to                   design than their globally clocked counterparts.  Since self-timed              techniques also allow subsystems of widely varying speeds to work               together, such systems may be improved incrementally by directly                replacing slower CMOS parts with faster GaAs parts.                                                                                                             As a first step towards the goal of building fast self-timed GaAs               systems a set of circuit modules are built with the PPL tool suite              developed at the University of Utah.  PPL can hide many of the                  complicated problems with GaAs circuit design and allow the                     designer to focus on the functionality of the system.  Combined                 with the benefits self-timing this should provide an attractive                 methodology for designing  extremely fast systems and exploring                 aspects of concurrent systems in gallium arsenide.",
