 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cells of eukaryotic organisms are organized to perform                      specialized functions.  For example, cells lining the stomach wall              are specialized to secrete gastric acid while cells that occupy the             middle layer of blood vessels are specialized to contract and                   relax, thereby closing and opening the vessel.  It is now known                 that one of the major biochemical mechanisms for controlling the                activity of the enzymes that regulate these specialized activities              is a process called protein phosphorylation.  Protein                           phosphorylation involves one type of enzyme, called a protein                   kinase,  modifying another type of protein, called a substrate, by              attaching phosphate groups to its backbone structure.  Once the                 substrate accepts the phosphate group, it is said to be                         phosphorylated and its activity or function changes.  The newly                 phosphorylated protein can then change the activity of the cell.                In the case of the cells that regulate the blood vessel tone (these             are called smooth muscle cells), the protein kinase must act                    quickly to  phosphorylate substrates so that blood flow can be                  adjusted rapidly.  It is not known how protein kinases can act so               quickly in the smooth muscle cell, however.  This proposal will                 test one hypothesis on how protein kinases in smooth muscle cells               rapidly phosphorylate proteins.  This hypothesis is called                      \"targeting\" which means simply that the protein kinase and the                  substrate are localized very near each other so that the process                may occur rapidly and efficiently.  We will utilize the techniques              of modern recombinant DNA technology and confocal laser scanning                microscopy (CLSM) to study how protein kinases situate themselves               in the cell so that they can be close by the substrate which they               phosphorylate.  This hypothesis is a new idea on how cells are                  structured, and challenges previous notions that the cell is merely             a \"bag of enzymes\" which \"swim around\" in search of substrate                   molecules.  The results of this study will shed light on the                    architecture of living cells and will hopefully provide a basis for             studying cellular events other than phosphorylation.",
