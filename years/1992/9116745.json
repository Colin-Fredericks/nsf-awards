The project, which will include                  Professor Edwin Turner of the Princeton University Observatory as               co-investigator on the U.S. side, brings together American and                  Japanese theoretical astrophysicists to study problems connected                with the formation of galaxies and cosmic large scale structure.                On the Japanese side, the research group includes scientists from               the National Astronomical Observatory and the Tokyo Metropolitan                University as well as Kyoto University.                                                                                                                         Among the studies on galaxy formation to be investigated are:                   imprints on the microwave background, phase transition generated                structure formation, non-zero cosmological constant cosmologies,                the relation of the intergalactic medium to background radiation                fields, quasar statistics, structure formation by Doppler instability,          gravitational lens statistics, phase transitions in the early universe,         and related topics.  Most of these projects will emphasize physics              other than the purely gravitational interactions that have been                 studied most thoroughly in the past.  It is hoped that this joint               study will lead to more permanent contacts between the two                      research communities.",
