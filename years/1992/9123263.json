 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a line of research on bargaining behavior.               The specific purpose of this study is to apply recently developed               strategic theories of bargaining with private information to data               on wage settlements and strike duration.  The broader aim of this               research is to develop a theoretical framework which is                         consistent with the facts, and which can eventually lead to                     systematic empirical analyses of important policy issues in                     collective bargaining.  Some of these policy issues include the                 treatment of eligibility for unemployment compensation and other                welfare benefits for striking workers, and proposals to mandate                 cooling off periods before a strike can commence.                                                                                                               The core of the research is a model of repeated negotiations in                 which the firm has private information which includes both                      transient and permanent components.  This model will be applied                 to a sequence of labor contracts negotiated by each bargaining                  pair with a view to explaining empirical results showing that                   strike incidence and duration in the last contract negotiation                  have a substantial effect on whether a strike occurs in the                     current negotiation.  The model will be tested with a sample of                 U.S. and Canadian labor contracts.",
