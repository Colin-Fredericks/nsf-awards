 "awd_abstract_narration": "The historic explosive eruptions of Krakatau (1883) and                         tambora(1815) volcanoes in Indonesia discharged over 40 km 3 of                 pyroclastic material into the sea, mostly as voluminous gravity                 flows.  With previous funding samples have been obtained of the                 submarine deposits areound Krakatau volcano by a diver.deployed                 coring system.  The study focussed on the origin of two ephmeral                islands, Steers and Calmeyer, that formed to the nortwest of                    Krakatau as a result of the catastrophic 1883 eruption.                         Underwater geologic mapping and preliminary examination of                      sediment cores indicate that the two islands were formed by the                 entrance of subaerially.generated pyroclastic flows into the sea.                                                                                               The findings have shed new light on the controversy surrounding                 the origing of devstating tsunamis associated with the eruption                 and the fate of Krakatau island during the paroxymal stage of the               event. New funds for as additional will be used to carry                        outstudies on the samples collected in 1990  and existing samples               of the tambora 1815 deposits.  Thermal demagnetization studies on               pumice and lithic clasts from the subaqueous pyroclastic flow                   deposits will be made to determine emplacement temperatures and                 investigate the role of seawater as colling agent during                        subaqueous transport and deposition. Detailed grain size,                       component abundance, and image analysis will also be carried out                to evaluate the nature of hot, pyroclastic flow interactions with               seawater.  These result will be significant in terms of                         understanding the eruptive processes of these event sand                        providing modern analogues of volcaniclastic sedimentation that                 can be applied to ancient convergent margin sequences in the                    geologic record.",
