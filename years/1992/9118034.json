 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued support from the Inorganic,                       Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program for studies of the                     photophysics of d6 diimine complexes by Dr. James N. Demas,                     Chemistry Department, University of Virginia.  The overall goal                 of the project is to develop rationally designed luminescent                    molecular probes for specific molecular sites.  He will                         investigate the effect of the proximity of a long hydrophobic                   hydrocarbon chain on the emission properties of the d6 metal                    center.  He will also study luminescent complexes intercalated                  into DNA with special emphasis on identification of                             fluorescence due to multiple bonding sites, and the rotational                  reorientation of the probe while bound to DNA.  In the course                   of the study, Demas will assess the effectiveness of time                       resolved phase sensitive emission in characterizing                             environmental effects on excited state properties.                              Steady-state, pulsed, and phase fluorimetry, as well as NMR and                 crystallography, will be used to examine variations in state                    ordering and decay paths of luminescent Ru(II), Os(II), Ir(II),                 and Re(I) photosensitizers.                                                     %%%                                                                             The electronic structure of luminescent metal complexes is                      sensitive to changes in local molecular environment.  When such                 complexes are bound to species like DNA, their electronic                       characteristics may be modified by the location or the symmetry                 of the site.  Conversely, complexes can be designed to detect                   the presence of certain sites.  In this project, the                            sensitivity of a new technique to detect changes in the                         flouresence of the probe due to its molecular environment will                  be tested.  In addition, the effect of changes in the                           hydrophobic environment on the luminescence of the metal                        complex will be investigated.  The project has implications for                 sensor technology and for the design and application of new                     probes for the structure and dynamics of DNA and other chiral                   biopolymers.",
