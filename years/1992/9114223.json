 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two visits over a two-year period by Dr. Paul               I. Abell of the University of Rhode Island to the University of                 Western Australia, to work with Drs. Karl-Heinz Wyrwoll, Jane C.                Newsome, and George Kendrick.  Mindful of the current debate on                 whether global warming and the greenhouse effect, brought on by                 various forms of atmospheric pollution, pose a threat to our                    global environment, the investigators propose examining past                    climatic changes in paleoclimates to map their temporal and                     geographic extent to give some warming of the magnitude of                      climatically-induced catastrophes.  Specifically, they will                     investigate the extent of the Younger Davis reglaciation event of               10,000 years ago, in western Australia, a region remote from its                putative source (meltwater diversion from glaciers in central                   Canada).  The investigators will use techniques of stable isotope               ratios of oxygen in the aragonitic shells of land gastropod                     shells (techniques pioneered by Dr. Abell in studies of climatic                change in central and southern Africa) to provide a proxy for                   climate change.  The isotopic studies at the University of Rhode                Island will be paralleled by pollen and sediment geomorphology                  studies by collaborators at the University of Western Australia.                Knowledge of what produced that event, how quickly it achieved                  its maximum, and how long it lasted, are crucial in understanding               what to expect in future climatic changes.",
