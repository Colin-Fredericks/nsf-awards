 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative: The research project \"Ultrafast Processes                  and Optoelectronic Properties of Semiconductor Microstructures\"                 will be a collaboration between Dr. Arora of the Tata Institute                 of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. Jagdeep                          Shah at the AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, N.J.  The specific                 aims of this proposal are: (1) to facilitate cooperation between                TIFR scientists and Dr. Shah and his group at the AT&T Bell                     Laboratories in setting up material and device structure                        preparation systems and time resolved measurement laboratory                    required for the study of the ultrafast phenomena in novel                      semiconductor heterostructure and superlattice systems, and (2)                 to collaborate in the research programs related to the                          optoelectronic properties of the above materials.                                                                                                               Scope: This proposal is for funds to cover the travel and the per               diem expenses of the Principal Investigator and other U.S.                      scientists participating in this collaboration.  The                            investigation is of great importance from the basic science point               of view as the studies will provide fundamental understanding of                nonequilibrium carrier dynamics and new optoelectronic phenomena                in the above structures.  Furthermore, the study is of great                    practical relevance in understanding the operation of novel                     devices which have been made from very special thin film                        heterostructures.  This proposal meets the objectives of the U.S.               -India Cooperative Science Program.  ***",
