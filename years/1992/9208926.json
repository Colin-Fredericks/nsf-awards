 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particulate and quantum-size heterojunctions are used as a                      means of promoting charge-carrier separation to specific                        spatially separated regions on a host titania photoconductor.                   Quantum yields for the mineralization of a model reactant                       mixture consisting of trichloroethylene, water, oxygen, and                     inert carrier gas on titania heterojunction photocatalysts,                     with the reactants delivered as vapors or gases, are                            correlated with the charge-carrier separation distances; the                    charge-carrier separation distance, in turn is a function of                    the composition and configuration of the heterojunction.                        Transport properties of optically generated charge carriers in                  particulate or colloidal catalysts are thought to be important                  in determining reaction pathways and kinetics.  Separation of                   photoelectrons from photoholes over distances exceeding simple                  charge transfer to adjacent atoms is frequently suggested as a                  way to prevent recombination and thusly increase quantum                        yields; this is the first direct test of such a concept.                        Time-resolved photocharge (TRPC) measurements, time-resolved                    microwave photoconductivity (TRMC) determinations, time-                        resolved absorption and desorption, and diffuse reflectance                     spectroscopy are used.                                                                                                                                          This work has applications to heterogeneous photocatalysis,                     photographic imaging, photovoltaic energy conversion,                           photoelectronic devices, environmental control, and water                       purification, including the specific system being                               investigated, namely the photocatalyzed oxidative degradation                   of organic pollutants on particulate or colloidal                               semiconductors.                                                                     //",
