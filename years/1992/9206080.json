 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bacterial reaction center complex mediates a series of                      efficient electron transfer reactions resulting in the conversion               of light into chemical energy.  This pigment-protein complex is the             only membrane protein whose structure has been determined to atomic             resolution.  While the highest resolution structural data (2.3A) is             available from the reaction centers of Rhodopseudomonas viridis, a              system for the expression of genetically modified reaction centers              in this organism is not available.  We have been characterizing a               heterotrophic strain of Rps. viridis which will be used to develop              such a genetic system.  The puf operon of Rps. viridis (encoding                the beta and alpha subunits of the light haveresting complex and                the L subunit, M subunit, and cytochrome subunit of the reaction                center) will be deleted from the Rps. viridis chromosome.  A                    plasmid containing a copy of the puf operon will be used to                     complement this chromosomal deletion.  To efficiently grow the                  large volumes of Rps. viridis required for spectroscopic and                    crystallographic studies of genetically engineered reaction                     centers, culture conditions will be optimized for the dark growth               of Rps. viridis in a bench fermentor.  The development of this                  system will allow the modification of pigment-protein binding                   interactions throughout the reaction center by site-directed                    mutagenesis of the Rps. viridis structural genes., followed by the              crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of these                    altered reaction center complexes.                                              %%%                                                                             The insights provided by the Rps. viridis reaction center system                will provide a more detailed understanding of substrate                         recognition/binding requirements in membrane proteins and electron              transfer in biological systems.",
