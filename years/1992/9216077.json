 "awd_abstract_narration": "Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM) is a new technique                  which allows for the measurement of interaction forces between                  a single colloid particle and a flat plate.  In this                            technique, a laser beam is reflected off of a glass slide at a                  small angle of incidence such that light is not refracted                       through the plate, but only reflected.  This total internal                     reflection produces an evanescent wave which does propagate                     normal to the surface.  A solution containing colloid                           particles, enclosed in a chamber, is placed on the glass                        slide, and the colloid particles scatter the evanescent wave.                   The scattering intensity decays exponentially with the                          separation distance of the particle from the wall.  The                         scattering intensity is measured by a photomultiplier tube,                     and from this measurement, the instantaneous separation                         distance of the particle from the wave can be measured.                                                                                                         The PI has used this technique to measure the effects of                        gravity and double layer forces on the equilibrium separation                   of a colloid particle from a surface.  The present effort                       extends the technique to the measurement of colloid forces                      during viscous flow.  Specifically, the PI proposes using this                  method to measure colloid particle - plate separation                           distances when fluid is flowing across the plate.  Radiation                    pressure will be used to immobilize the sphere so that                          scattering intensity can be measured, and results will                          therefore be obtained for separation distances of a stationary                  colloid particle with fluid streaming about the particle.  The                  PI has already developed an electrohydrodynamic theory for the                  forces exerted on the colloid particle.  These calculations                     reveal the existence of a lift force which causes the sphere                    to migrate away from the plate wall irrespective of the                         surface charge.  In the absence of double layer forces, this                    lift force is equal to zero.  With the aid to the TIRM                          experiments, the PI hopes to verify the existence of the                        electrokinetic lift force.",
