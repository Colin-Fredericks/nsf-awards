 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Symposium entitled, Mind Matters, held at Carnegie Mellon                  University on October 25-27, 1992 features unpublished papers of a              technical nature describing original research in the areas of                   computer science and cognition.  It is held in honor of Allen                   Newell, who has made seminal contributions to computer science and              cognitive science . He is generally regarded as one of the founding             fathers of the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Newell\u001as                   research for the past decade has focussed on the development of                 SOAR, as both an integrated architecture for building intelligent               systems and as a unified theory of cognition.  Soar is the unifying             thread for this symposium. A member of the Soar community follows               each invited speaker\u001as talk, discussing the implications of the                 results just presented for the Soar architecture.  The speakers,                leading scholars in computer science and cognitive research, and                their topics are chosen to reflect the diversity of Professor                   Newell\u001as interests. The proceedings of the symposium are to be                  published as a book by Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers, as part of                  their Carnegie Symposium on Cognition series.",
