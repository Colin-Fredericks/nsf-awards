 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social structure functions to assign people to specific                    positions that have differential levels of prestige and power                   associated with them.  Persons' perceptions have been studied                   in laboratory experiments and found to vary according to the                    differential prestige and power they hold as members of positions               in specific social structures.  This doctoral dissertation project              will study the extent to which perceptions vary with position                   within the context of a currently existing and ongoing social                   structure.  Data will be collected from individuals at all levels               of the organizational structure of the Jobs Opportunities and Basic             Skills program in Indiana by conducting personal interviews or by               means of mail questionnaires.                                                                                                                                        This project will contribute to an important area of interface             between social psychology and sociology; namely, perceptions and                social position.  It will provide a test of theory on differential              perceptions of people in varying positions within the context of                real-life social positions of prestige and power.  It also will                 provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
