 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand the structure              and  catalytic mechanism of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP).  CCP is              a 34,000 M.W. monomeric heme protein that catalyses the reductive               cleavage of peroxide to water, using ferrous cytochrome c as the                electron donor.  The crystal structures of CCP, its two-electron                oxidation product, Compound I (formed by the reaction of the enzyme             with peroxide), enzyme:inhibitor complexes, and several mutant CCPs             have been solved.  The available structural information makes CCP               an attractive system for the study of intermolecular electron                   transfer and O-O bond activation by heme proteins.  The proposed                investigation will employ site-directed mutagenesis to perturb the              enzyme structure and X-ray crystallography to describe the                      resulting structural changes.  Subsequent characterization of these             mutants by spectroscopic and kinetic techniques will be used to                 relate the changes in structure to changes in the primary reactions             of the enzyme.  The results of the proposed research will provide               insight into the structural features that are involved in                       electrostatic recognition between macromolecule and rapid transfer              of electrons between heme proteins.  The proposed work will also                provide insight into the mechanisms that proteins use to modify the             reactivity of the heme prosthetic group to accomplish a                         characteristic reaction.",
