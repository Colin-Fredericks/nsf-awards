 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences              at Carnegie Mellon University to continue a successful Research                 Experiences for Undergraduate SITE.  The Department conducts                    research in cell biology, genetics, molecular biology,                          developmental biology, biochemistry and biophysics.  Each student               will carry out an original research project devised by a faculty                mentor who is a leader in his or her area of expertise.  Students               will also attend a special seminar series and workshops ranging                 from honor in science to applying to graduate school, and present               the results of their research at a concluding symposium.  Students              will be recruited from colleges and universities all over the                   United States.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students                from liberal arts colleges and the recruitment of a significant                 number of minority students and women is a major goal.  Selection               of students will be based upon academic criteria (SAT or ACT                    scores), letters of recommendation, as well as the students' stated             interest in research.  For the 1992 summer research program, the                CMU administration has pledged $30,000 in supplemental university               funds.  These funds will be used to support an increased number of              student participants.  The number of participants in 1992 will be               approximately 15 to 18.",
