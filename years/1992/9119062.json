 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major question in plant biology concerns the role of light in                 regulation of chloroplast gene expression and the mechanisms for                positive and negative control of chloroplast genes are incompletely             understood.  The unicellular rhodophyte, Cyanidium caldarium, has               a number of properties which make it a good system for                          investigating photoregulated chloroplast genes.  The light                      harvesting antenna in this organism is comprised of phycobilisomes,             which are macromolecular assemblies containing allophycocyanin,                 phycocyanin and several linker polypeptides.  Cells grown in the                dark contain a small etioplast which develops into a large                      chloroplast in the light.  This is accompanied by 50 fold increases             in the levels of mRNAs for apc, cpc, and other chloroplast genes,               such as psaA, psbA and rbcL.  Turnover rates of chloroplast                     photogenes will be determined in dark and light to determine                    whether accumulation of transcripts in light results from increased             transcription activity, changes in mRNA stability, or both.  In                 addition, heme promotes accumulation of transcripts for certain                 chloroplast photogenes in the dark and mechanisms underlying this               process will be investigated (Aim 1).  Experiments will be                      performed to determine whether genes for linker polypeptides are                photoregulated and whether levels of transcripts of these genes are             modulated by heme (Aim 2).  Genes for allophycocyanin and                       phycocyanin will be cloned and sequenced in order to identify                   possible light- and heme-responsive regulatory elements (Aim 3).                A homologous in vitro transcription system will be developed to                 investigate factors involved in regulation of chloroplast                       photogenes.",
