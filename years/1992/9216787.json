The general theme of this meeting,                     \"Brain and Memory: Modulation and Mediation of Neuroplasticity\"                 is timely and of high importance to the field.   State-of-the-art               lectures will be given by internationally recognized                            investigators highlighting four exciting areas.  First, the                     relationship between emotion and memory will be examined.  The                  findings and theories examined in this session have implications                for understanding the role of motivation, emotion and stress in                 learning and memory.  Second, recent findings and theory                        concerning age-related changes in brain and memory in animals and               humans will be explored.  The third session will focus on the                   plasticity in the cerebral cortex, which has received only                      limited attention to date but has long been recognized as the                   main processing structure and probably the ultimate forebrain                   storage site of memories.  Finally, the relationship between                    long-term potentiation and memory will be probed.  The format of                this conference will insure cross-fertilization of ideas on                     fundamentally important questions on how we learn and remember.                 Some of the funds are to used for support of selected graduate                  and postdoctoral students who might overwise not be able to                     attend this outstanding conference.***//",
