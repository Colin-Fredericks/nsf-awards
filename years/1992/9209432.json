 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most important things people learn are learned without              explicit instruction; often, people are not even aware that they                are learning something.  One of the most dramatic examples of this              phenomenon is language.  Virtually all speakers of a language learn             to speak and understand before formal instruction even begins, and              the learning process seems to be largely unaffected by attempts of              adults to guide it.  This style of learning contrasts with the more             explicit learning which also occurs when people consciously attempt             to master a domain, and which typically involves explicit                       formulation and testing of hypotheses.  Although considerable                   research has been carried out on explicit learning, implicit                    learning has been investigated only recently.  Furthermore, most of             this research has been experimental, with relatively little work                focussed on developing theories or computational models.                                                                                                        The purpose of this research is to develop both a theory and a                  testable computational model of implicit learning of sequential                 behaviors.  The research will use experimental techniques to ask                the following questions:  Under what conditions is implicit                     learning triggered?  Are there domains in which implicit learning               is more effective than explicit learning?  What are the constraints             on the types of things which can be learned with implicit learning?             A second component of the research will focus on trying to                      understand the possible mechanism for implicit learning by                      developing a computational model.  This model, based on an                      artificial neural network architecture proposed by Elman, has been              shown to have interesting properties which resemble the behaviors               of humans engaged in implicit learning tasks.                                                                                                                   Elaboration of this model should allow for better understanding of              the circumstances which facilitate learning of domains such as                  language and might make it possible to structure training                       environments in order to maximize learning.  This work should also              provide a foundation for the construction of machine-based systems              for learning domains currently only well-mastered by humans.",
