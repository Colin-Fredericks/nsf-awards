 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of the research is the number theoretic                       aspects of computational problems.  In recent years there has                   been a resurgence of interest in this area.  Ancient problems                   have been solved(e.g. primality testing), new subdisciplines                    have been spawned (e.g. public-key cryptography) and deep                       mathematical tools have emerged (e.g. Abelian varieties, class                  field theory).                                                                                                                                                  One area of particular interest is the new 'number field                        sieve'.  This collection of algorithms, developed by many                       researchers, is the most significant advance in integer                         factoring in the last quarter century.  The PI will continue                    to investigate improvements and generalizations of this                         method.  The application of the number field sieve to the                       discrete logarithm problem is of particular interest.                                                                                                           A second area of interest is the application of recent results                  to public-key cryptography.  The United States Government has                   recently proposed a national 'Digital Signature Standard'                       (DSS).  The proposed signature scheme is controversial and the                  potential of several methods will be investigated, including                    the number field sieve, for breaking the proposed system or                     for introducing 'trapdoors'.  Another area of investigation                     involves the development of new mathematical tools.",
