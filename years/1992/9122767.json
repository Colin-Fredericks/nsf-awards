 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the use of a beam                       of high energy electons to reduce the emission of                               pollutants in gases emitted from combustion processes.                          The objective of this project is to provide a sufficiently                      comprehensive demonstration of the concept's technical                          feasibility to determine its economic viability and                             commercial potential.  Tasks include design, fabrication                        and operation of an experimental system to process                              simulated exhaust gases; experiments to characterize                            reduction in pollutant concentrations as a function of                          dose and to identify products produced during application                       of the process; performance of theoretical analyses to                          establish models for application of the concept to                              engineering design; and development of a conceptual design                      for a full-scale processing system capable of operating at                      a gas flow-rate of 5,000 liters per second.                                                                                                                     The proposal leading to this recommendation results from                        completion of a Phase I, Small Business Innovation                              Research project conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-61169 in                      which the scientific feasibility of this concept was                            demonstrated.  This Phase II award was made in accord with                      procedures contained in Program Solicitation NSF 90-31,                         Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR).",
