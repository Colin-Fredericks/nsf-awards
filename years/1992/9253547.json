Current research                                                interests include rough surface                                                 scattering, radar scattering from                                               icy moons, ultrasound mammography,                                              computer-aided instruction in                                                   electromagnetics, and microwave                                                 nondestructive evaluation.  The PFF                                             Award will be used to establish a                                               Laboratory for Numerical Studies in                                             Wave Propagation and Scattering for                                             research in the aforementioned                                                  topics.                                                                         In rough surface scattering the work                                            is in two areas:  developing models                                             that accurately predict scattering                                              from randomly rough surfaces and                                                developing a Monte Carlo finite-                                                difference time-domain (FDTD)                                                   method) to perform exact numerical                                              simulations of scattering from rough                                            surfaces.  We are also using the                                                FDTD method to try to solve the                                                 puzzle of anomalous polarization                                                returns from icy moons, an                                                      understanding of which is needed to                                             assist in determining the origin and                                            evolution of icy moons.  In ultra                                               sound mammography we are working on                                             an imaging algorithm that will                                                  permit the early detection of breast                                            tumors when patient prognosis is                                                most favorable.  In the area of                                                 education we have developed                                                     interactive software that is used in                                            conjunction with two required                                                   junior-level courses in                                                         electromagnetics.  The software is                                              composed of notebooks, each with                                                animated graphics, equations, and                                               text covering a particular topic.                                               Ten have been written to date, and                                              more are underway.  Finally, the                                                plan is to expand the research to                                               study the use of microwave                                                      nondestructive evaluation to detect                                             defects in large composite                                                      structures such as an airplane wing.                                            We will use the FDTD method to study                                            microwave scattering induced by the                                             different defects within complex                                                composite materials.",
