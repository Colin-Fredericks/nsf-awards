 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will study how muscle function and bone              movement (physiological features of organisms) correlate with                   structural (morphological) and behavioral features.  Most work to               date has focused on animal morphology, and relatively little                    research has been done on the physiological function of features                of organisms as these functions relate to morphology and behavior.              In particular, a general question of interest to comparative                    biologists will be addressed: how congruent are the distributions               of physiological and morphological characteristics in organisms?                     The muscles and bones of the head region in fishes will be                 used as a model system to investigate this question.  With nearly               23,000 species, ray-finned fishes comprise more than half of all                vertebrates, and have proven to be an excellent model system for                the study of animal function in the past.  In addition, many of the             fish groups to be studied are of considerable economic importance               while others occur in regions of the world where there is great                 concern for the loss of biodiversity.                                                This research will contribute to our understanding of (1) the              utility of physiological data for testing comparative hypotheses                in biology, (2) the biomechanics of bone and muscle function in                 vertebrates, and (3) our understanding of the biodiversity of the               largest group of vertebrates.",
