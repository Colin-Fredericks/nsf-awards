 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, there is no parallel algorithm that can solve                      optimal control problems efficiently on computers with a large                  number of processors.  This research will develop two parallel                  algorithms to solve large scale optimal control problems that are               expected to be efficient with a large number of processors.  The                first algorithm, called the Hybrid algorithm, is a combination of               the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and a stagewise                      Newton's method, both of which are serial.  The Hybrid parallel                 algorithm is designed primarily for unconstrained optimal control               problems.  The second algorithm, called an SQP-type algorithm, is               derived by utilizing special features of the optimal control                    problem along with a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)                     approach.  The SQP-type algorithm is suitable for both the                      unconstrained and constrained optimal control problem.  In both                 algorithms, each processor is assigned to solve an optimization                 problem over a group of time periods.  Codes will be developed                  for machines with medium-grain parallel capabilities e.g., the                  Intel iPSC/860 and Kendall Square computers.  A typical                         engineering application involving a nonlinear flexible structural               problem with 10,000 time periods will be used to evaluate the                   proposed algorithms.",
