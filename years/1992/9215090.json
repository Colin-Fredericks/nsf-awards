 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms of                  ocean-atmosphere interaction in the tropics and the phenomena that              these produce.  The methods and models already developed will be                applied to three main areas:                                                                                                                                    1)   Contined work on interannual variability, emphasizing                           analytical as well as numerical approaches.                                                                                                                2)   Initiation of work on the effects of coupled feedbacks in the                   climatology.  Tropical climate features in coupled general                      circulation models (GCMs) appear to be quite sensitive to                       coupled feedbacks involving three-dimensional dynamical                         interactions.  Much of the current discussion of ocean-                         atmosphere interaction in tropical climate centers on a one-                    dimensional, vertical column point of view.  A complementary                    approach is proposed, aimed at developing understanding of the                  interactions which are nonlocal in the horizontal.                                                                                                         3)   Tropcial atmosphere modeling.  Current simple atmospheric                       models used in coupling have a number of deficiencies for this                  type of study.  Further development of a model of complexity                    intermediate between these and atmospheric GCMs is proposed;                    in particular one for which near-analytic versions can be                       obtained in simplifying cases, thanks to the properties of the                  Betts (1986) convection scheme.  The mechanisms driving both                    the tropical atmospheric response to surface boundary                           conditions and intraseasonal variability, such as the Madden-                   Julian oscillation, will be examined.                                                                                                                           This research is important because it is one of the studies                which will help determine the feasibility of modeling the coupled               ocean-atmosphere system for the purpose of predicting its                       variations on time scales of months to years, an issue of concern               in climate variability.",
