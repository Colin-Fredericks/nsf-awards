The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. John P. Svaren to go to the University of Munich to work                 with Dr. Wolfram Horz.  Their project is designed to explore the                ability of eukaryotic trans-activators to modulate chromatin                    structure.  Numerous in vitro studies have shown that nucleosomes               can block binding of critical transcription factors to a DNA                    template.  In addition, the promoters of most actively transcribing             genes appear to be at least partially nucleosome-free.  Therefore,              since virtually all eukaryotic DNA is normally packaged into                    nucleosomes, there must be some mechanism to keep nucleosomes                   from occupying critical promoter elements of active genes.  Study               of the PHO5 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae should                   give more insight into this process.  Upon induction of PHO5                    transcription (by phosphate starvation), four nucleosomes are                   removed from the promoter region.  Several experiments by Dr.                   Wolfram Horz's lab suggest that the trans-activator, PHO4, is                   responsible for triggering the nucleosome loss.  Drs. Svaren and                Horz's project is designed to map the protein domain of PHO4 that               is involved in nucleosome dissolution.  In particular, the acidic               domain of PHO4 will be investigated to see whether it is necessary              or sufficient for this transformation.  These experiments could                 potentially reveal another mechanism whereby trans-acting factors               regulate transcription.                                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.",
