 "awd_abstract_narration": "The strength, movement, and associated precipitation of fronts             traversing orographic features can be significantly affected by the             terrain.  Dr. Knight will continue his studies of frontal inter-                action with topography via two approaches.  A two-dimensional                   numerical model based on the primitive equations of meteorology                 will be used to calculate the suite of physical processes involved              in the interaction.  The model cold front will be formed by the                 shear flow induced by an evolving non-linear baroclinic Eady wave               (the theoretical analogue of a developing midlatitude cyclone).                 The effect of varying mountain sizes and atmospheric stabilities                will be simulated, in both the presence and absence of atmospheric              moisture.  Under the second approach, the model's simulations will              guide the observational analysis of case studies of cold fronts                 crossing the Appalachians.  Observed fronts that are significantly              affected by the mountains will be compared with those that are not.             In addition to elucidating aspects of the interaction, the case                 studies will provide a partial check on the verisimilitude of the               model simulations.  Better understanding of the interaction may                 lead to improved predictions of precipitation in mountainous                    terrain, a key aid in water resource management.",
