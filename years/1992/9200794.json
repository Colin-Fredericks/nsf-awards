 "awd_abstract_narration": "A formal foundation for real-time computing will be                        developed.  Five directions will be pursued in the hope of                      increasing the scope of applicability and reducing the cost of                  current methodologies for the construction and analysis of                      time-critical systems.  Theoretical issues associated with the                  analog-clock model will be investigated.  A satisfactory theory                 of finite-state computation has already been developed for a                    digital-clock model; the use of analog clocks would permit                      proofs of more precise real-time guarantees and would support                   compositional proof methods.  Second, investigations will be                    undertaken to reduce the cost of model checking by exploiting                   symbolic relationships between time delays.  Success in this                    endeavor would allow an important class of program verification                 techniques be applied to a larger class of problems than is                     presently possible.  Further, time-bounded temporal operators                   will be used to classify timing constraints and to develop                      temporal proof rules for new classes of real-time properties.                   Fourth, investigations will commence into the verification of                   so-called hybrid systems - systems that contain both discrete                   and continuous processes.  Finally, freeze quantification, a                    byproduct of the study of real-time logics, will be applied in                  time-independent domains.                                                           The ultimate goal of this line of research is to provide                    the system designer with a wide range of tools that support the                 production of computing systems with predictable timing                         characteristics.",
