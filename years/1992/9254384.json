 "awd_abstract_narration": "Informal learning in math, science, and technology is an                        increasingly important vehicle for educating the public.                        Throughout their lifetime, the average citizen will spend                       a much greater amount of time in informal learning                              environments than in school.  For these efforts to                              continue without benefit of understanding, the dynamics                         of what makes informal learning experiences work, is a                          waste of valuable funding resources.  Research                                  Communications Ltd. (RCL) proposes an effort to                                 investigate what has been learned about informal learning                       in math, science, and technology and to develop some                            directions for future research in this important area.                          The first step in the process would be to review the                            existing literature in the three primary areas of                               informal education for math, science, and technology:                           television/radio, community projects, and science museums                       and technology centers with a focus on evaluation studies                       that have shown what strategies have worked and those                           that have not.  The outcome of this effort would be a                           comprehensive publication of what is currently known                            about informal learning research in math, science and                           technology.",
