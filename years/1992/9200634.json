 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported by this award will focus on several areas of                mathematical analysis related to singular integral operators,                   averages over curves and surfaces, maximal functions, Fourier                   integral operators, and Fourier multipliers on compact and                      noncompact manifolds. One of the central problems in mathematical               analysis is that of recovering a function through various                       differentiation techniques applied to integrals of the function                 restricted to curves or surfaces.  Although there is now a                      considerable body of literature on this subject, the curves have                always been confined to those satisfying strong curvature                       conditions. Efforts to obtain more general information will                     require local maximal function estimates on compact sets.  The                  thrust of the research will be to find these estimates first.                   This work, in turn, has close connections with singular integral                operators of Calderon-Zygmund type.  One of the obstructions is                 the dependence of past arguments on the Fourier transform.  There               is now some evidence that progress is possible which will bypass                this impediment. Other work will concentrate on local smoothing                 properties for wave equations.  The general idea behind local                   smoothing is one of establishing measurement of the size of a                   solution of a wave equation for time periods rather than for a                  fixed instant of time.  The measurements are given in terms of                  the boundary values associated with the equation.  Some local                   smoothing results have been obtained, especially in higher                      dimensions.  The most difficult cases are spatial dimensions two                and three. Ultimately, one must establish variants of the Kakeya-               maximal operator and control of its p-th power norm.                                 Work on estimates of degenerate Fourier integral operators,                radial Fourier multipliers on noncompact Riemannian manifolds and               estimates of the Szego kernel for pseudoconvex domains will                     continue.  Mathematical research in harmonic analysis seeks to                  study the fine structure of mathematical functions and their                    underlying domains of definition.  The tools developed by this                  work bring out hidden relationships not ordinarily detected by                  more classical methods.",
