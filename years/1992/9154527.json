 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project uses science performance test data                      collected under the auspices of the California Assessment Program               (CAP) to refine and apply new methods for scoring performance                   tests and for modeling cognitive abilities.  After working with                 data and for modeling cognitive abilities.  After working with                  data already collected, the PI will collaborate with CAP                        personnel to incorporate features into future performance tests                 that will facilitate the forms of analysis proposed.  The                       analytical methods to be developed involved modeling underlying                 abilities in terms of discrete states, rather than continue.                    Task performance is likewise represented in terms of discrete                   states, and mappings are derived from ability states to task                    performance states.  Representations and mappings are in terms of               partially ordered sets, distributive lattices, and related                      mathematical structures.  Restricted latent class models are used               to make inferences about true task performance state and true                   ability state in the presence of random classification errors.",
