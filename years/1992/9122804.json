 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is much debate in political science literature about whether              the rise of global financial markets is socially beneficial or                  harmful.  Unnoticed in this debate is the impact which                          international financial transactions may have on democratic                     institutions.  For example, do international financial flows                    prevent citizens from altering the content and especially the                   effects of fiscal and monetary policies through elections?  This                research investigation addresses this question by assessing how the             workings of the global financial system affects and is affected by              specific features of electoral institutions.  The investigator will             attend to this question through the construction and analysis of                theoretically grounded, mathematical and statistical models of                  financially open democratic systems. This project should enhance                our understanding of the emerging global financial system by                    employing a more systematic and sound approach to the topic than                has previously existed.",
