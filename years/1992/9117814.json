 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed project is to understand the metabolic                 controls on proline and putrescine synthesis in two plants (pea,                oat) that exhibit fundamentally different responses to osmotic                  stress.  Oat leaves accumulate putrescine to high levels, while                 proline accumulation is minimal.  Pea leaves accumulate proline,                but very little putrescine.  Radiolabeled precursors and inhibitors             of the arginine, putrescine and proline biosynthetic pathways will              be used to investigate basic metabolic responses to stress in these             plants.  Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the                       activities of the arginine decarboxylase (ADC), which catalyzes the             first reaction in the putrescine biosynthetic pathway, and                      pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), an enzyme which carries               out the final step in proline biosynthesis will be investigated.                There is evidence that the activities of both ADC and P5CR are                  stress-inducible and these enzymes may play important roles in the              regulation of proline and putrescine accumulation in response to                stress.  A more complete understanding of stress-dependent changes              in these pathways may yield new insights into basic underlying                  stress adaptation strategies used by plants and may lead to the                 development of cultivars with improved stress tolerance                         characteristics.",
