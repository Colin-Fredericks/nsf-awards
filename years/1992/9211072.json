 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach known as the Source Galerkin method for Quantum                  Field Theory will be pursued.  Source Galerkin, unlike current                  Monte Carlo based techniques, explicitly uses spacetime and                     internal symmetries of a system to pose the problem of solution                 so as to allow considerable analytic input.  The complexity of                  this requires one to use computer algebra to generate the                       equations coded for computation on Cray's and CM-2's.  Results                  have been sensationally good with many orders of magnitude                      improvement in speed and accuracy compared to Monte Carlo.                      Source Galerkin has the property that fermions and bosons can be                treated (aside from commutation) in a symmetric manner.  It is                  not necessary to solve a fermion problem exactly for any given                  boson configuration as with Monte Carlo.  Consequently, problems                involving dynamical fermions are no harder than those with                      bosons.  Problems of physical significance will be analyzed with                Source Galerkin methods during this research.  We expect to                     examine Hubbard models for high temperature superconductivity                   without a \"sign problem\".  We anticipate obtaining valid                        dynamical results in Lattice QCD.  While it is certain that                     teraflop technology will still allow only a limited class of                    results for conventional QCD, it is possible that these new ideas               will allow us to obtain predictive and valid QCD results.",
