A new,                                                   versatile stochastic model                                                      formulated in both discrete-time                                                and continuous-time will be                                                     developed to represent the desired                                              features of the ground motion.                                                  System identification techniques                                                will be developed to calibrate the                                              model against real earthquake                                                   records.  Nonlinear random                                                      vibration method will be used to                                                gain insights into the effects of                                               the ground motion nonstationarity                                               on linear and nonlinear structural                                              response.  The models of inelastic                                              action will be considered to                                                    represent the realistic smooth                                                  hysteretic behavior with                                                        progressive deterioration.                                                                                                                                      The research undertaken will                                                    provide improved understanding of                                               earthquake-induced damage in                                                    structures and the way it is                                                    influenced by various ground motion                                             parameters.  It will also help                                                  assess effects and relative                                                     importance of the various                                                       excitation and system parameters on                                             the statistics of structural                                                    response and damage.",
