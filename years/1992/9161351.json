This award is to support Phase I research to determine the                      feasibility of using fish ventilatory response profiles in                      an automated and continuously monitored system to detect                        toxicity of effluents from wastewater collection and                            treatment systems.  The involves assessment of those                            profiles to determine or predict the cause of toxicity and                      to relate fish responses such as cough behavior, activity                       patters and orientation behavior to the pollutant-                              exposures.                                                                                                                                                      The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                             response to NSF 91-20, Small Business Innovation Research                       (SBIR).  Results of this research are expected to                               determine the technical feasibility of the proposed                             concept and the basis for potential continuation of the                         research into a subsequent Phase II.",
