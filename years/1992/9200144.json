 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Silas C. Blackstock at Vanderbilt University.                      Electron transfer mediated fragmentations and rearrangements                    will be examined.  In particular, fragmentations of                             nitrogen-containing substrates such as diazenes, nitroso                        compounds, and azooxides, and rearrangements of                                 methylenecyclopropane and allyl vinyl ether will be examined                    under oxidative conditions.  Short lived radical ion                            intermediates will be spectroscopically characterized by low                    temperature solid state and solution ESR methods.  The                          structures of the radical ion intermediates will be engineered                  to enhance their lifetimes in order to allow their direct                       observations.  Reaction rate measurements to determine electron                 transfer mediated rate accelerations and product analysis to                    evaluate mechanistic hypotheses will also be conducted.                         %%%                                                                             The removal of an electron from an organic molecule frequently                  results in cleavage of the molecule or rearrangement of the                     connectivity of its atoms.  In this project a variety of carbon                 and nitrogen containing substrates will be used to examine                      these reactions.  These processes are energetically  costly or                  nonexistant in the neutral precursors.  This work  will study                   the electron deficient intermediates directly in order to                       understand how electron transfer accelerates these reactions.                   Knowledge gained from this study will facilitate informed                       development of new electron transfer applications in organic                    chemistry.",
