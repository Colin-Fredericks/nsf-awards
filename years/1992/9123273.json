The                                   two researchers have worked on different aspects                                of the study of iterative methods for the                                       efficient solution of linear and nonlinear                                      algebraic systems of equations on both                                          sequential and parallel computers.  Frommer has                                 worked extensively on linear and nonlinear                                      asynchronous methods and on multisplitting                                      methods.  Szyld and his coauthors have worked on                                two-stage methods, including the tools needed                                   for their analysis and computational                                            experiments.  Recently the two collaborators                                    completed a study of two-stage iterative methods                                for H-matrices.  In the proposed new work, they                                 will extend this study to block two-stage                                       methods and asynchronous (chaotic) parallel                                     methods.  They will look at both convergence                                    properties as well as implementation details.                                   This work relies heavily on the complementary                                   expertise that each has developed in prior work.                                                                                                                A central problem in many science and                                           engineering applications is the solution of                                     large linear systems of algebraic equations.                                    The cooperating scientists will study                                           theoretical, computational and algorithmic                                      aspects of the solution of such systems and                                     their applications.  The project is likely to                                   result in criteria to determine an optimal or                                   near-optimal number of inner iterations to                                      guarantee overall convergence and reduce                                        parallel computing time.",
