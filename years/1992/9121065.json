Power of the Chemistry Department at                 the University of California at Davis.  The primary focus of                    the work will be synthesis and characterization of monomeric                    and polymeric species containing multiple bonds between main                    group III and V elements.  In some cases both elements will be                  heavier members of the series, e.g., In-P.  In other cases,                     only one member will be a later element, e.g., B-Sb or B-Bi.                    Particular attention will be paid to the synthesis of ring                      species, in which delocalized bonding might occur.  In                          addition, preparation of other compounds containing main group                  elements from groups III through VI which are multiply bonded                   will be attempted.  For example, species containing Al=C and                    Ga=C will be prepared.  Compounds will be characterized by                      X-ray structures and NMR spectrometry.                                          %%%                                                                             New compounds containing members of the boron family and the                    nitrogen family will be prepared.  These compounds are unusual                  because they contain multiple bonds between elements of these                   families.  The strength of the second bond will be determined                   and compared to theoretical predictions.  Bonds between these                   elements do not usually occur in discrete molecules, but are                    common in materials used as semiconductors or ceramics.  This                   research provides an opportunity to learn more about the nature                 of such bonding and thus may help guide design of electronic or                 structural materials with specific properties.",
