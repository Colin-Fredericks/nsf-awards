 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the National Science & Technology Week (NSTW)                program will support the Maryland Science Center, in cooperation                with the State of Maryland, in its effort to plan and carry out a               project to focus public attention on the importance of scientific               education, research, and technological development in a week-long               educational program.  Called Maryland Science Week, this project                will place science and technology at the center of public attention             through a series of activities that could be a national model for               similar projects throughout the nation.  The Maryland Science                   Center has obtained $25,000 from the office of Governor William                 Donald Schaefer and expects to raise an additional $50,000 from                 Maryland's corporate community.  This $50,000 grant from the                    National Science Foundation will complete the $100,000 fund out of              which project activities may be effected.  These activities include             special events as well as production of materials and presentation              of workshops for teachers, such events as are already closely                   identified with the program of National Science & Technology Week               and which can advance the mutual goals of local and national                    programs of public outreach.                                                         When completed, this project should provide the basis for                  similar partnerships between NSTW and additional states, whose                  projects and local funding suggest similar gains in extending                   public awareness of the importance of science and technology in                 daily life and of the necessity of preparing future generations of              the nation's students to choose careers in these fields.",
