 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research to find                                    a strategy for describing the reduction                                         kinetics of organic substrates in natural                                       environments that is both rigorously                                            deterministic in theory as well as being                                        amenable to practical application.  The                                         approach will be to treat the substance                                         directly responsible for the reduction of                                       organic pollutants as electron-transfer                                         mediators that are present at low steady-                                       state concentration and can be assayed by                                       their rate of reaction with selective probe                                     compounds.  The first part of this project                                      will be to identify suitable probe compounds                                    for likely reduction mediators, and to verify                                   that these techniques can be used in natural                                    media.  Later, the most promising probe                                         technique will be applied to show that the                                      mediator to which the probe technique                                           responds is, in fact, contributing to                                           reduction in environmental systems.  Finally,                                   the utility of the whole approach for                                           predicting the rate of specific reduction                                       reactions of organic pollutants in the                                          environment will be demonstrated.  The                                          proposal leading to this award was submitted                                    in response to NSF 88-99 as modified by                                         changes dated 09/19/91 to make the Research                                     Initiation Award announcement consistent with                                   changes in NSF 83-57 and published as NSF 90-                                   77.                                                                                                                                                             Despite recent research on the reduction                                        reactions of organic pollutants in anaerobic                                    sediments, soils, and groundwaters, it is not                                   yet possible to quantitatively predict the                                      rates of any of these transformations.  This                                    severely restricts the consideration of                                         reduction processes in regulatory decision-                                     making and contributes to the unreliability                                     of remediation technologies that rely on                                        these reactions.  If this research proves to                                    be as successful as it was for describing the                                   kinetics of photooxidation in sunlit surface                                    water, it is likely to influence the way most                                   research on the kinetics of reduction                                           reactions in anaerobic environmental systems                                    is done in the future.  Results of this                                         research are likely to be applied to                                            engineering design of processes and systems                                     for decontamination of soils and groundwater.",
