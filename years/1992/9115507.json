 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of solar changes on decadal-to-millennial                    scale climate variability is a matter of some dispute.  In a                    previous study the PIs correlated atmospheric 14C records with a                number of different indices of climate and found that the                       correspondence was quite weak for many records.  However, the                   correlation was significantly higher for one record in China, and               other studies continue to provide some support for a sun-climate                connection.  The PIs therefore believe it is appropriate to                     suggest a sun-climate connection that may be statistically                      significant, but at the same time contributes only a modest                     amount of the variance to centennial-scale climate change.                      Viewed from this perspective, several objectives for further work               suggest themselves; expanded analysis of climate records in order               to more systematically examine the sun-climate connection, with                 special emphasis on trying to determine the amount of variance                  explained by any significant correlations, and whether there is                 some larger-scale coherence to regions of poor or good                          correlation.  It is also necessary to determine whether the                     proposed sensitivity of the climate system on centennial-time                   scales is consistent with both solar and climate models.  The PIs               therefore specifically propose the following:  (1) refined                      statistical analyses of a greater number of paleoclimate records,               including climate correlations with both 14C and 10Be solar                     indices; and (2) modeling the geographic response to periodic                   solar constant variations.  This research should help clarify the               significance of a sun-climate connection, and perhaps why some                  records seem to show a connection while others do not.",
