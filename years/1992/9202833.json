 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will concern mathematical logic and its                        connections with other areas of mathematics, especially algebra and             analysis.  C. Ward Henson will continue developing his model theory             for Banach spaces and will investigate topics in nonstandard                    analysis, including descriptive set theory on hyperfinite sets.  In             addition, he will study the computational complexity of logical                 decision problems, including the theory of the real exponential                 field.  Carl Jockusch will work in classical recursion theory and               its connections with other areas.  In particular, he will study                 degrees of unsolvability, both in their own right and in connection             with model-theoretic structures (especially Boolean algebras and                certain groups).  L. van den Dries will investigate definability in             algebraic and analytic structures.  In particular, he will                      investigate O-minimality in expansions of the ordered field of real             numbers and questions connected with A. Wilkie's recent proof that              the elementary theory of the expansions of this ordered field by                exponentiation is model complete.  He will also study the model                 theory of local and Henselian fields.                                                Mathematical logic is a natural tool for studying any                      discipline expressed in a formal language, which should bring most              of mathematics itself under its focus.  Algebra and number theory               and certain parts of analysis are particularly natural subjects for             this type of treatment.  Large parts of the instant project bear                this out.  A typical result of the investigators' recent work is                the proof of a completeness conjecture raised by Tarski:  Is there              a finite list of true identities combining polynomial formation and             exponentiation of constants from which all other such true                      identities can be derived?  (Counterexamples are known to exist if              exponentiation of variables is allowed.)  Another area in which a               natural role for logic can be found is the complexity of                        algorithms.  The investigators have been ingenious in finding such              niches as well as in exploring them, to the obvious benefit of both             logic and the other discipline involved.",
