 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project addresses the transition from                              theory to application of an approach to H00-control                             design based on skew Toeplitz theory.  The theory                               will be used as a new means for investigating                                   control problems for flexible systems.  The control                             problems to be considered are similar in spirit to                              those studied previously for finite-dimensional                                 systems.  A significant difference is that the Laplace                          Transforms of distributed system components, not                                finite-dimensional approximations of them, will be                              used in the control design process.  Recent                                     theoretical advances have been made to address                                  control problems for distributed systems subjected                              to perturbations.  The proposer and her                                         collaborators have applied the theory to problems                               of controlling the vibrations of ideal, flexible beams                          subjected to an uncertain feedback time-delay and                               other perturbations.  Their beam studies suggest                                that applying the theory to more sophisticated                                  control problems for flexible systems is feasible.  It                          is proposed that flexible systems be analyzed in the                            frequency domain, pertinent H00-control problems                                be formulated and solved, and computer                                          experimentation with optimal and sub-optimal                                    designs be conducted.  This will also include the                               development of supporting computational methods                                 and software.",
