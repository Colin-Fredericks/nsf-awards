 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasites are ubiquitous and can exert powerful long-term selection             on hosts.  Host-parasite interactions may promote species                       diversity, alter host behavior, contribute to speciation and                    perhaps foster and maintain sex.  My research uses a common                     arthropod parasite to investigate host-parasite coevolution.  The               parasite is a cytoplasmically transmitted bacterium that causes                 reproductive incompatability.  Crosses between infected males and               uninfected females are sterile.  By \"sterilizing\" females not                   transmitting the parasite, infected males increase the frequency of             infection and the parasite should spread until all individuals are              infected.  Two questions about host-parasite coevolution are                    addressed.  Is there genetic variation for parasite-induced affects             on host reproductive success?  A genetic analysis measures the                  heritability of the parasite's effect on the host reproductive                  success.  The response to selection (R) depends on selection (S)                and heritability (h2), R=S*h2.  Thus this experiment elucidates the             potential of the host-parasite system to evolve.  The second                    question is:  How does parasite virulence evolve?  Novel parasite               strains will be introduced into different host genetic backgrounds.             The parasite's effects on the host will be measured over long and               short term.  This experiment is an important test of models of                  parasite virulance.  Together, these experiments provide important              information on host-parasite coevolution.",
