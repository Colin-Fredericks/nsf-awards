Proposed participants include Professor Donald K. Brandvold,                    Chair, \"Chemistry Department, Dr. James Jones, Physics                          Department,Professor Carl J. Popp (PI), Professor David J.                      Raymond, Chair,Physics Department, Professor William Rison,                     Department of Electrical Engineering, Professor Stephen D. Schery               (Co-PI), Professor Ronald Thomas, Department of Electrical                      Engineering, andProfessor William P. Winn, Physics Department and               Chair, Langmuir Laboratory.  The Departments of Chemistry and                   Physics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology have               maintained an REU site for five years.  NMIMT has ongoing                       programs in studies of atmospheric electricity, atmospheric                     chemistry, and acid deposition centered around facilities                       available at the Irving Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric                     Research located near Socorro, New Mexico and the physics and                   chemistry laboratories on the NMIMT campus.  The PIs plan to                    support eight students to participate in the REU site, and they                 intend to allocate six of the eight awards to students outside of               the NMIMT through a formal application procedure.  Additionally,                they plan to involve minority students in the program.  Students                will have the opportunity to participate in the following                       studies:  1) The role of large liquid drops in precipitation                    development (Prof. Blyth); 2) Chemistry of N2O in lightning and                 corona:  field and laboratory experiments (Prof. Brandvold); 3)                 Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment data                    analysis (Dr. Jones); 4) Distribution, sources, and effects of                  acidic precipitation in New Mexico (Prof. Popp); 5) Rainwater                   chemistry associated with lightning discharges; 6)Cloud                         physics and mesoscale convective systems (Prof. Raymond); 7)                    Lightning (Prof. Rison); 8) Atmospheric Radioactivity (Prof.                    Schery); 9) Remote atmospheric and ionospheric detection system                 (Prof. Thomas); and 10) Electrical structure of thunderstorms                   (Prof. Winn).",
