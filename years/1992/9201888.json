 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase 2 project is              in the general area of electrochemistry in the subfield of                      inorganic synthesis.  Caustic soda is manufactured in the USA to                the extent of about 36,500 tons/day at a market value of about $25              million/day, almost exclusively by the electrolysis of brine.                   Chlorine is produced simultaneously and has suffered a declining                market with no economical routes for its destruction or dumping.                Hence, there are real opportunities for alternative manufacturing               processes not involving chlorine.  The Phase I research project                 successfully demonstrated such a process based on the electrolysis              of an alternative sodium salt.  The Phase II research effort will               identify state-of-the-art cell components and cell design and                   modify these accordingly to achieve minimum cell voltage, high                  caustic current efficiency, and high caustic concentration, of up               to 50% by weight.  Factors contributing to the stability and                    performance of the membranes and electrodes will be studied                     carefully, and the process will be evaluated under extended                     electrolysis conditions.  Statistical design methodology will be                followed.  The results of these studies will form the basis of a                preliminary engineering design for the overall process and an                   economic assessment of capital and operating costs.                             %%%                                                                             This research has the potential for the development of a new way of             making caustic soda without chlorine byproduct.  This is an                     excellent example of an environmentally benign synthesis which                  could have a significant societal impact.",
