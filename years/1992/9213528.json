 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a twelve month long-term visit by                       Professor Chris Macosko, Department of Chemical Engineering and                 Materials Science, University of Minnesota, to Japan for a                      cooperative research project with Professor Takashi Inoue,                      Department of Organic and Polymeric Materials and Professor                     Seiichi Nakahama, Department of Polymer Chemistry, Tokyo                        Institute of Technology.  The researchers plan to undertake a                   study of melt coupling of immiscible polymers by chain end                      reactions.  Polymer blends are the fastest growing area of the                  plastics market.  The researchers will form diblock coploymers by               reactively coupling chains during melt blending.  Polystyrene and               poly(e-vinyl-pyridine) will be synthesized anionically and then                 terminated with functional groups.  Two reactive pairs will be                  studied: cyclic anhydride with amine and epoxy with carboxylic                  acid.  They will then directly add an amine to the end of a                     living anionic chain and then extend this approach to the other                 groups.  This process will be followed by size exclusion                        chromatography as a function of mixing intensity, time and                      temperature, as well as the type of functional group and size of                the attached polymer chain.  The interfacial thickness will be                  measured by an automated ellipsometer.  Morphology development                  during melt mixing will be followed by time resolved light                      scattering.  Electron microscopy will be used on quenched                       samples.  Samples prepared with and without coupling reaction and               with premade diblocks will then be compared.                                                                                                                    Results of the research should contribute to development of new                 strategies for creating and controlling the morphology of                       immiscible polymer blends.  Professor Inoue's strengths are in                  the area of polymer physics particularly light scattering,                      morphology and thermodynamics.  He has also done excellent work                 on mechanical properties of immiscible polymer blends.  Professor               Macosko's expertise lies in the areas of rheology, process flows                and neutron scattering methods.  It is expected that this                       research project should provide a fruitful collaboration.  It is                also expected that there will be industry participation in this                 project since each of the researchers have strong industrial                    contacts.",
