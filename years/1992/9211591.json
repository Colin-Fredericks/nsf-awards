 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the role of altruism and self interest in               shaping behavior towards the environment.  A better understanding               of this relationship is important because climate change, ozone                 depletion and loss of biodiversity all involve resources that are               in large part public goods.  For this reason, most mechanisms                   proposed to mitigate global environmental change involve public                 policies that require a tradeoff between individual and                         collective costs and benefits in the provision of environmental                 quality.  Structural equation models will be used to analyze data               collected in phone interviews with 500 individuals.                                  This study will provide baseline information on public views               on key global change issues, such as greenhouse warming and                     species loss.  The study will also contribute to our                            understanding of how willingness to pay for public policies aimed               at reducing global warming and speciesloss depend on                            environmental attitudes and values.",
