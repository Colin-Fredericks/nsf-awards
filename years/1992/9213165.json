 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Henry Wright, MS Sigrid Gabler, a                    graduate student at the Univeristy of Michigan, will collect data               for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct archaeological                  research in the eastern region of Madagascar and focus on the                   emergence and development of iron working technology. Both                      historical records and archaeological evidence indicate that iron               smelting was once widespread. Ms. Gabler will examine three sites               in the Ankay region. She will map surface finds in terms of                     artifact densities, locate potential slag heaps and collect a                   sample of surface artifacts. In a second phase she will undertake               subsurface testing for features, especially iron working locales.               In the final field phase careful horizontal exposures will be                   made to uncover iron working locales. Size of slag heaps will be                measured to determine production output. Carbon samples for                     dating and samples of plant remains will also be collected.                     Ceramic analysis will be conducted to establish both relative age               of sites and to determine activities which occurred. Subsequent                 metallurgical analysis will serve to reconstruct the smelting                   process.                                                                                                                                                        Madagascar was originally settled by Southeast Asian peoples and                not from the mainland continent of Africa. In prehistoric times                 chiefdoms developed and the earliest European observers found                   highly centralized societies.  The means by which chiefdoms                     emerged on this isolated and circumscribed island however are not               understood.  Archaeologists have focussed much attention in                     recent years on how complex societies arise since this process is               seen in many parts of the world. They believe that specialization               and control over labor together with social stratification plays                a major role but whether it serves as a cause per se or is a                    secondary manifestation is not known.  Ms.Gabler's research will                address this issue.  Because the byproducts of iron smelting are                so archaeologically visible and because they preserve well in the               archaeological record, the Madagascar data provide an excellent                 entree to this issue.  Extensive historical records give a                      context to interpret the prehistoric data.                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons. It will add                     significantly to our knowledge of a poorly understood region of                 the world. It will shed new light on the origins of complex                     society and will assist in the training of a promising student.",
