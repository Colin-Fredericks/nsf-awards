(1) There                 are individual differnces in rules concerning choice, and these                 differences are associated with different life outcomes.  (2) The               rules that are associated with preferable outcomes are lay,                     intuitive versions of the normative cost-benefit rules of                       microeconomic theory.  (3) These lay versions of cost-benefit                   rules can be highly abstract, in that they apply across an                      extremely broad range of content domains.  (4) An implication of                the abstract, domain independent nature of cost-benefit rules is                that they can be taught quite effectively, with small amounts of                instruction, both as abstract rule systems and as rule systems in               a particular domain that will spontaneously generalize to other                 domains.  (5) Therefore it should be possible to teach cost-                    benefit rules in an efficient fashion and improve people's life                 outcomes.                                                                            This research program will also begin exploratory work                     attempting to find out what problem-solving strategies and                      behaviors might mediate between knowledge of cost-benefit rules                 and superior choice outcomes.                                                        This work has implications for descriptive and normative                   theory as well as practical implications.  The major implication                for descriptive theory would be that highly abstract rules, at a                level shown by the Principal Investigator and his colleagues to                 mediate inference, also mediate choice behavior.  The normative                 contribution would be to add empirical data to the currently                    purely mathematically-based assertion that cost-benefit rule use                improves outcomes.  The major practical implication would be that               it may turn out to be possible to improve both personal and                     professional life outcomes with relatively small amounts of                     instruction -- substantially less than characterizes a course in                microeconomics.",
