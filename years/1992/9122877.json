Glasser of                   Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Dr. V.L.                   Chiang of Michigan Technical University, and Dr. R. Narayan of                  Purdue University, under the U.S.-Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie                 Joint Fund to research \"New Directions for Lignin Utilization.\"                 The researchers will study new directions of lignin utilization as a            source for modified polymers production as well as in a form of                 polymeric carriers as a matrix for preparation of controlled release            pesticides suitable for agricultural application.  Lignin, a by-                product of producing wood pulp, is now mainly burned as an                      energy source, but this produces toxic sulfur dioxide gases harmful             to the environment.  The researchers believe lignin could serve as a            source of new products, especially polymers.                                                                                                                    This project in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of                    advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities               in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of               equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
