 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many problems in science and engineering share the common                  form that an unknown \"signal\" has to be restored from blurred                   observations on a known transformation of the signal.                           Mathematically this requires solving a (linear) system of                       equations, typically in an infinite dimensional space, where the                data only suffice to construct a noisy approximation of the                     transformed signal.  Solution depends upon the inversion of the                 operator.  Studying this inversion problem in a Hilbert space                   setting can provide a unifying approach for constructing                        solutions, by exploiting techniques from spectral and harmonic                  analysis.  Then statistical aspects such as error analysis and                  cross-validation can be examined.                                                    A famous example of this kind of problem is the technique of               computerized tomography used in medical practice to recover an                  image of internal structures in the body.  Because in practice,                 measurements are blurred by errors, and because only a limited x-               ray exposure is possible, measurement of the \"signal\" (in this                  case the attenuation of the x-rays passing through the body) is                 imperfect indeed.  Still, very refined images can be                            reconstructed and are very useful.  Other well-known applications               are image reconstruction and all kinds of deconvolution problems.",
