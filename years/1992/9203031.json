 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study fine root                       dynamics along a floodplain forest chronosequence sere on the                   Bonanza Creek LTER near Fairbanks, Alaska.  The aboveground                     structure and function of these and other taiga forests are well                documented, but little is known about below ground processes.                   Direct observations of roots, made with minirhizotrons, will be                 used to study the life history and longevity of fine roots and                  mycorrhizae.  These data will be used to estimate the rate at                   which the fine root system is turning over and being replaced                   each year.  Fine root/mycorrhizae production and motality rates                 determined via direct observation will be combined with biomass                 and nutrient content data derived from destructive harvest of the               root systems to determine patterns of carbon allocation to fine                 roots and mycorrhizae during succession.  The research is                       designed to capitalize on the strengths of direct and indirect                  methods of studying root systems to better understand the role of               roots and mycorrhizae in ecosystem processes in the Alaskan                     taiga.",
