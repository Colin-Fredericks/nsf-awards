 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, which is jointly sponsored by the National Science                  Foundation and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will support a                  cooperative research project between Dr. Tseng-Yin Tien,                        Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the University               of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Dr. Yan Dongsheng, Division of                     Chemistry at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics.  Silicon nitride               ceramics is one of the most promising materials for structural                  applications.  However, it can not be densified without the use                 of sintering additives.  The research will include phase                        equilibrium studies in silicon nitride-metal oxide systems and                  mechanical property measurements of selected specimens.  Samples                will be prepared and then analyzed using X-ray diffraction and an               electron microscope.                                                                                                                                            Results of the research will lead to a greater understanding                    between composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of                silicon nitride ceramics.  This research will further result in                 the development of silicon nitride ceramics with optimum                        mechanical properties.  The Shanghai Institute of Ceramics and                  Professor Yan are world famous experts on phase diagrams.                       Professor Tien and his Michigan group are the pre-eminent                       researchers in this area in the United States.  This                            collaboration should produce important scientific as well as                    technical results.  It is likely that these researchers will                    continue their research exchanges even after this award has                     terminated.",
