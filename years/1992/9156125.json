These changes are modeled after Perry's theories of \"cognitive                  development.\"  Faculty and student teaching assistants assigned                 to the course will receive prior training (a workshop led by                    Dr. Craig E. Nelson of Indiana University, a recognized                         authority in the field) in the methods to be used.  Assessment                  of student pre and post course critical thinking skills and                     attitudes towards education and towards science and scientists                  will be by interviews of students and a paper and pencil test                   to be selected.  An educational consultant interested in                        developing critical thinking skills will conduct the testing                    phase of the proposal and will advise concerning appropriate                    forums for dissemination.",
