 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor A. Nemethi to               work in algebraic geometry.  He will work on invariants of                      singularities and global polynomials.  He plans to study the                    behavior of the signature for composed singularities.  He hopes                 to see the connections between the signature of surface                         singularities and the Casson invariant of links.                                     The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                 the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                 to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems                that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                       polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                       algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                 is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                   itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                      computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
