 "awd_abstract_narration": "The astronomical facilities at the University of Wyoming's Infrared             Observatory (WIRO) are to be renovated.  Since its construction in              the mid- 1970s, no major renovations of the telescope facilities                have occurred.  Due partially to equipment failure, and advancing               technology, the WIRO telescopes no longer can perform the wide                  range of functions that they originally were designed for.                                                                                                      Support will be used in three critical areas of infrastructure.                 First, the antiquated, essentially non-functional on-campus                     telescope will be replaced with a DFM Engineering 0.6 m telescope.              Also, the 2.3 m telescope, the primary research tool of WIRO users              will be upgraded.  The current, outmoded telescope multiplexers                 will be replaced with industry standard, \"off-the-shelf\" IEEE 488               hardware.  A modern pump station with a leak detector assembly for              dewar maintenance will be acquired, and the present dome shutter                system will be replaced with a modern, aerodynamic shutter design               to improve the ability to conduct observation during high wind                  conditions.  The third area of emphasis is an upgrade of the                    observatory computer facilities.  The current set of PC-ATs will                be replaced with a SPARC workstation.  Modernization of each                    component is critically necessary for effective, integrated                     operation of the WIRO as a viable training and research facility.                                                                                               Research emphasis for the renovated facility is observational                   extragalactic and stellar astronomy, digital image                              reconstruction/signal processing of astronomical images, and                    instrument development.  These broad fields are areas of shared                 interest among all the astronomy faculty at WIRO and many of the                physicists in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.",
