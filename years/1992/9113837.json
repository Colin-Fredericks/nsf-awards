 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1989, seven countries in Eastern Europe have begun the                    transition from one-party rule to constitutional democracy:                     Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and                Yugoslavia.  Historically unprecedented, this wave of constitution-             writing presents an exceptional opportunity for the study of                    constututionalism, comparatively and transnationally.  Although the             American and French experiences at the end of the eighteenth                    century took place at the same time, the sharp dissimilarities                  between the two countries limit the fruitfulness of comparative                 study.  But contemporary developments in Eastern Europe are ideal               for comparative and transnational study for a number of reasons.                All of the countries have emerged from a comparable period of                   Communist Party rule.  Also, all have pre-constitutional                        traditions.  And, along with the liberalization and democratization             of political institutions, all are undertaking transitions from                 central planning to a market economy.                                                                                                                           This project will enable the construction of a data bank for                    unprecedented, comparative and transnational study of the                       sociolegal dynamics of constitutionlism.  Specifically, comparable              data from each of the seven Eastern European countries will be                  collected, translated, coded, and archived according to the                     following analytic categories: legislative-government relations;                electoral laws; the formation of political parties; the formation               and implementation of basic rights; constitutional courts and                   judicial review; institutionalization of the liberal concept of                 private property; federalism and local government; ethnic,                      religious and linguistic minorities; degree of autonomy of state                agencies and corporations; restitution and retribution; and the                 constitution-making process.  These data will be available on                   Microsoft Word and Macintosh.  Scholars will be informed about                  additions to the data bank through a quarterly newsletter.",
