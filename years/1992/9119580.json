 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth is situated in a solar wind, whose origins are unclear.               The source of this is \"coronal holes\".  This study deals with                   this plasma source.  The fact that Alfven waves may play a                      significant role in the energy balance in solar coronal holes has               been known for many years.  The traditional view has been that                  these waves are generated in the convectively unstable                          subphotospheric layers.  Just very recently Parker (1991,                       Astrophys. J., 372, 719) and Moore et al. (1991, Astrophys. J.,                 376, in press) have suggested that these waves can be generated                 by small-scale magnetic fields assoicated with the network and                  presented some qualitative arguments to support this idea.                      Because there are also other mechanisms of Alfven wave generation               operating in the solar atmosphere, more detailed calculations are               needed to estimate which mechanism dominates in the excitation of               these waves.  The PI propose to calculate the wave energy spectra               and energy fluxes for three different mechanisms of Alfven wave                 generation: (1) excitation of transverse waves on magnetic flux                 tubes by the subphotospheric convection, (2) generation of                      transverse tube waves by the photospheric granulation, and (3)                  excitation of Alfven waves by the network microflaring.  To find                out which mechanism is dominant in supplying the wave energy into               solar coronal holes, the PI will compare all three obtained wave                energy fluxes with total heat input required by observations.                   This study will be important in ongoing efforts to understand                   the principal energy sources for solar coronal holes and the                    basic physical processes responsible for creating the                           heliosphere, in which the Earth resides.",
