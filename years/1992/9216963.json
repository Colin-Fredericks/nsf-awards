 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year award in the form of a Cooperative Agreement                       betweenthe National Science Foundation and the Microelectronics                 Center of North Carolina (MCNC)  will establish the Clearinghouse               for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR).  In the              past year several user-friendly client-server tools have been                   developed for locating and retrieving information contained in                  platforms reachable over the Internet.  Among them, Wide Area                   Information Server (WAIS), Gopher and Archie have become very                   popular, globally, and World-Wide-Web (WWW) is poised for                       popularity once suitable client software is developed and                       distributed.  WAIS, Archie and Gopher present overviews of where                information of interest is lilely to reside, and then they assist               the user in locating specific information objects.  WWW permits a               user to thread a path through the network by opening up network                 connections to referenced information by mouse-clicking on \u0131active!             hypertext. While focused on the particulars of WAIS evolution, MCNC             will work closely with the developers of other tools toward                     providing compatibility and consistency, and, to the extent                     possible, convergence of the tools. The WAIS-specific activity will             provide a central focus and forum for WAIS evolution and will                   minimize the divergence of individual WAIS-based implementations.               In addition, the CNIDR will conduct a workshop, under the auspices              of the Education and Human Resource (EHR) Applications of Advanced              Technology Program.  The purpose of the workshop will be to                     evaluate the state of the art in networked information retrieval as             applied to the EHR materials development, teacher enhancement,                  network testbed, and dissemination projects, and to educate                     and support the NSF project investigators in the uses of                        networked information retrieval tools.",
