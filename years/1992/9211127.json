 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) will have                    archived over a terabyte of heterogeneous image data by the end                 of this year.  Other LTER sites are similarly amassing large,                   complicated data sets.  Ecologists want to transform this raw                   data into useful information to provide new insight into long -                 term ecological phenomena.  Unfortunately, the procedures,                      software tools, and user friendly interfaces necessary to                       facilitate access to these data sets over high-speed networks are               currently lacking.  This precludes analysis on supercomputers at                national centers and subsequent visualization by ecologists                     located at remote sites.                                                                                                                                        The specific objective of the research will be to develop                       software that not only enables but encourages LTER ecologists to                more fully utilize multi-resolution, multi-spectral, time-                      varying, multi-dimensional data from Sevilleta.  The solutions                  developed will be driven by the particular needs of the Sevilleta               ecologists and will be applicable to other LTER sites.  This does               not preclude the design of more generic components, with a                      broader scope of application.                                                                                                                                   The goal of the collaboration among the Khoros Project at the                   University of New Mexico, the Sevilleta LTER site, and San Diego                Supercomputer Center is implementation of a prototype system                    whereby researchers can access, analyze, and visualize Sevilleta                data from remote locations.",
