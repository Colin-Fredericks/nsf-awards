 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to examine the                                   relationship between chromatin structure and gene activity in                   higher eukaryotes.  Studies on basal and regulated                              transcription by RNA polymerase II have generally focussed upon                 the identification and characterization of promoter-and                         enhancer-binding proteins with naked DNA templates.  Recent                     findings on the mechanism of transcriptional activation by                      these sequence specific factors strongly suggest that dynamic                   interactions between chromatin and the transcription factors                    are involve in the regulation of gene expression.  For                          instance, it has been found that these transcriptional                          \"activators\" may actually function as antirepressors--that is                   they appear, at least in part, to counteract repression of                      basal transcription by chromatin.  In this award the                            working hypothesis is that there are key interactions between                   transcription factors and components of chromatin in the                        course of activation and repression of gene activity.  Two                      different systems for reconstitution of chromatin will be                       developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                     template for in vitro transcription analysis .  These studies                   should lead to a better understanding of the process of gene                    activation and should eventually be applied to the molecular                    analysis of diseases involving improper expression of genes,                    such as some forms of cancer.",
