To achieve this goal, a new concept                                             and approach has been invented.  The                                            approach is based upon the direct                                               detection of local variations in                                                optical field intensity by a silicon                                            photodector probe of nanometer size.                                            The probe is raster scanned in close                                            proximity to an optically                                                       illuminated surface and the                                                     photoresponse of the probe is                                                   measured and recorded at each point.                                            This information is electronically                                              displayed in a manner similar to                                                that of a Scanning Tunnelling                                                   Microscope.  The resultant image                                                represents the local optical field                                              intensity at each point on the                                                  illuminated sample surface.  The                                                achievement of this goal will                                                   require the design and development                                              of a new silicon nanoprobe and the                                              demonstration of the novel concept                                              of \"Near Field Photodection Optical                                             Microscopy\".  The second objective                                              is to explore the use of this new                                               nanoprobe for doing local optical                                               spectroscopy on the nanometer scale.                                            This will be accomplished by                                                    focusing a tunable optical source                                               onto a surface which has                                                        heterogeneous optical properties.                                               The nanoprobe is positioned in close                                            proximity to a specific sample                                                  feature and the nanoprobe                                                       photoresponse is measured as the                                                frequency of the illumination source                                            is tuned over a given frequency                                                 range.  The measured photoresponse                                              as a function of frequency is a                                                 spectroscopic fingerprint which                                                 should allow identification of                                                  chemical or molecular species at the                                            sample surface with nanometer scale                                             resolution.",
