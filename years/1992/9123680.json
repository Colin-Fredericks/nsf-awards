Until recently, this field of engineering                       science and quantitative cell biology was one of the least                      explored areas of investigation.  In view of the rapidly                        expanding knowledge of the regulation of protein                                synthesis, post-translational processing and secretion                          during the past two years, a third cross-disciplinary                           conference entirely devoted to cell culture engineering is                      timely.  This conference will bring together scientists                         interested in the biology of secretory protein synthesis,                       post-translational processing, protein secretions, control                      of cellular differentiation in vitro, and transgenic                            expression systems, with engineers interested in                                bioreactor technology, tissue engineering, vaccine                              production, process monitoring, protein homogeneity, and                        protein purity.",
