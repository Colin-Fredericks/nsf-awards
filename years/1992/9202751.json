 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosystem I (PS I), the light-dependent plastocyanin-                         ferredoxin oxidoreductase, is a photosynthetic multisubunit                     pigment-protein complex in the thylakoid membranes of                           chloroplasts and cyanobacteria.  All cofactors and electron                     transfer centers in PS I are associated with three                              polypeptides; the role of the accessory polypeptides, (2) study                 of the requirements and mechanism of assembly of these                          accessory subunits into PS I complex.  The most feasible                        approach to achieve the first objective involves molecular                      cloning and characterization of the genes encoding these                        polypeptides in the naturally transformable cyanobacterium                      Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and then generating mutants                          specifically lacking these genes by targeted mutagenesis.                       Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses of PS I from these                       mutants will be conducted to assess the effects of loss of                      individual accessory polypeptides on the assembly and function                  of PS I.  In vitro reconstitution systems will be used to                       identify the physiological requirements for the assembly of                     these polypeptides into PS I and to determine the sequence of                   their assembly.                                                                 %%%                                                                             Plants, green algae and cyanobacteria convert light energy into                 chemical energy with the evolution of molecular oxygen by the                   process of photosynthesis.  Oxygenic photosynthesis is the                      major source of biological energy and oxygen on this planet and                 a better understanding of this process is essential for facing                  the food and environmental challenges of the future.",
