His intention is to bring the material he learns to                 bear on ethical and value questions raised in the practice of                   ecological restoration and to publish journal and magazine articles             on his findings.  This base of information about environmental                  philosophy and the history of ideas about nature will be used in                the development of the journal Restoration and Management Notes,                which the investigator edits, in curricula, and in conferences,                 symposia, workshops and other programs of the University of                     Wisconsin at Madison Arboretum and the Society for Ecological                   Restoration.",
