The work will develop                     methods of combinatorial synthesis of organic compounds which                   may have physiological activity. The approach of combinatorial                  sythesis is important because it can lead to very many more                     compounds than the current \"one at a time\" methods. This                        becomes particularly useful when systematically related                         derivatives are desired. The work to be done will lead to                       benzodiazepines from the acylation or alkylation of amino                       benzophenones in microtiter plates. Methods will be developed                   to produce libraries of more complex products.                                  %%%                                                                             Currently, synthetic methods are limited by the fact that they                  produce one compound at a time. This work will lead to the                      simultaneous production of many related compounds. Development                  of the methods to be studied can lead to much more efficient                    and less expensive approaches to important drugs for human                      diseases.",
