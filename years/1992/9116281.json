 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research combines laboratory and field                             investigations to examine the oceanographic processes responsible               for the sources and sinks of DOC.  A crucial problem with the                   marine DOC cycle is that the overwhelming input of riverine DOC,                mostly in the form of dissolved humic substances (DHS), must be                 removed from seawater to be replaced with non-humic, non-                       biologically recognizable DOC from predominantly marine sources.                However, the processes responsible for either the terrestrial                   sinks or the marine sources of DOC have not been identified.                    Major hypotheses to be tested are:  1) Photooxidation represents                only the first step in a abiotic-biotic pathway which transforms                allochthonous DHS into microbially labile step in a abiotic-                    biotic pathway which transforms allochthonous DHS into                          microbially labile macromolecules; 2) Photooxidation of marine                  detrital material modifies and photo-condenses biochemical                      components in marine POC into leachable, non-recognizable,                      microbially resistant DOC; and 3) Terrestrial and marine DOC can                be selectively concentrated from seawater using physical/chemical               separation techniques.  To test these hypotheses, the approach                  will be to use laboratory photooxidation experiments together                   with microbial microcosm studies to investigate light-induced                   biological changes in DOC, and molecular and spectroscopic                      analyses to examine the chemical changes.  In addition, molecular               (biomarker) and isotopic analysis will be used to characterize                  the dissolved and colloidal organic matter in samples collected                 on transects across the Georgia shelf where there are both                      terrestrial (river and marsh) and marine sources.  These results                will constrain potential processes for input and removal of DOC                 from the ocean and define the distribution of marine and                        terrestrial organic matter in coastal waters.",
