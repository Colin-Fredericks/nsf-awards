 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports William A. Lanford and a graduate student                   of the University at Albany, SUNY, to collaborate in studies                    of the surface chemistry of glass with Dieter R. Fuchs and                      others of the Fraunhofer Institute for Glass Research in                        Wurzburg, Germany.  The scientific goal of their research is                    to improve understanding of the mechanisms leading to the                       corrosion of glasses.  This requires sophisticated techniques                   of chemical and physical analysis to characterize the state of                  the glass surface as it is changed by exposure to water and                     gases.  The collaborating Fraunhofer Institute has world class                  facilities for traditional glass chemistry.  Among other                        activities, the German group is currently very involved in                      research to provide a sound basis for treatments to conserve                    historic stained glass.  They have developed some glass                         compositions to use as test models for appropriate                              experiments, and are working on various coatings to protect                     old glasses from further deterioration.  The U.S. team at the                   Accelerator Laboratories of SUNY Albany brings to the                           collaboration special expertise and equipment for nuclear                       reaction analysis and various spectrometric methods that are                    necessary for the surface characterization.  They will also                     participate in experimental analysis of new coatings developed                  originally for use in the microelectronic industry.                                                                                                             The results of this research will increase knowledge of the                     chemical reactivity of glass surfaces, a subject with diverse                   implications in industry and every day life.  The proposed                      collaborative research will make an immediate contribution to                   the current international effort to preserve historic stained                   glass, through the involvement of the German institute in a                     NATO sponsored project on this subject.  Sound conservation                     efforts require as complete knowledge as possible of the                        mechanisms leading to the corrosion of these glasses.",
