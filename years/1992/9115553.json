 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              solid mechanics between Xanthippi Markenscoff of the University                 of California in San Diego and Helmut Kirchner of the Institute of              Materials Science at the University of Paris (South).  The objective            of their research is to develop a mathematical model which                      addresses dislocation effects in fracture mechanics.  Dr.                       Markenscoff brings to this cooperation innovative approaches to                 problems involving the dynamics of dislocations in structures and               the elasticity of structural materials.  This is complemented by the            French investigator's extensive experience in dislocation theory and            numerical approaches to elasticity problems.                                                                                                                    The investigators are dealing with important issues in mechanics                which are often stumbling blocks to effective evaluation of                     construction materials.  Their joint effort will result in a unified            theory and mathematical model which will advance our                            understanding of the mechanical behavior of structures and the                  effects of dislocation on fractured solids.",
