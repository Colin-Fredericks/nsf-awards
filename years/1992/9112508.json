 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kreitzberg will study winter fronts and weather using data                 sets from special observational programs (GALE, 1986; and                       STORMFEST, 1992) in comparison with detailed numerical model                    solution fields.  The goal is to determine the role of fronts in                producing clouds and precipitation in winter.  The hypothesis is                that the role of strong fronts in producing these patterns is                   substantial, but that it has been obscured until now by the lack of             high resolution (mesoscale) information on the structure of the                 phenomena.  A key task will be to determine how well models can                 reproduce frontal structures that can be resolved in the special                data sets.  The research includes participation in the STORMFEST                experiment particularly in directing the research aircraft, the                 King Air, in its surveys of these structures.  Detailed, real-time              model predictions will be used to guide research aircraft                       deployment and interpretation of mesoscale observations in these                regions.  This novel approach, if successful, will be a                         breakthrough in the conduct of mesoscale field experiments.  It has             the potential for much more economical and effective use of                     relatively expensive aircraft as research platforms in already                  scheduled experimental components of the U.S. Weather Research                  Program over the next decade.",
