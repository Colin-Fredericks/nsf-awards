 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed renovation of the science                                     laboratory will provide a modern, safe and                                      attractive facility for research and research                                   training for undergraduate women science majors                                 and science faculty.  The renovated area (1660 sq.                              ft.) will provide more laboratory tables and                                    sinks, a greater number of hoods, ample space for                               laboratory instruments, a safety center, updated                                chemical storage and waste collection areas, and                                good overall ventilation - all of which are                                     critical to an undergraduate research laboratory.                               Further, renovation of the tissue culture and                                   microbial culture areas will greatly reduce                                     contamination and stimulate biochemical research.                               The renovated laboratory meets the research needs                               of the five full-time and three part-time science                               faculty in Biology and Chemistry.  Projects                                     include inorganic synthesis, electrochemistry,                                  catalysis, enzyme structure and function, data                                  acquisition protocol and microcomputer                                          applications for chemical analysis, molecular                                   biology of senescence, control of carotenoid                                    synthesis in citrus fruit, microencapsulation of                                chemicals for controlled release systems,                                       nutritional studies of microbes, and development                                of pesticide resistant plants.                                                       This project will create an exciting and                                   stimulating environment where young women,                                      especially minority young women, can develop their                              confidence and potential as scientists and                                      encourage them to consider science and engineering                              careers.",
