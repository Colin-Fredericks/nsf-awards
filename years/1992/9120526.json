Parr at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in                    which he is continuing his work on density functional theory.                   The new work continues the development of qualitative                           applications of the theory to a variety of systems of chemical                  significance.  It also involves cooperation with Professor Yang                 of Duke University on further extension of the \"divide and                      conquer\" strategy they have developed for computational                         applications of the theory.                                                     %%%                                                                             Density functional theory is an alternative to the commonly                     used ab initio approach to the quantum chemical description of                  molecules.  It can be used in a qualitative manner to permit                    the deduction of useful correlations and generalizations with                   limited computational requirements.  This research effort is                    developing further applications and techniques to broaden the                   utility of the method and apply it to currently puzzling                        chemical phenomena.",
