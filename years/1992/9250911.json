 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power engineering students in the Electrical Engineering                        Department at the University of Wyoming are using a graphics-                   oriented software tool for education, research, and training in                 a new 486-based personal computer laboratory.  The tool called                  COPERITE has all user interfaces, menus and windows, resident                   on the computers in the laboratory.  The application programs                   are executed on a faster DEC 3100 workstation networked with                    the PCs through an ethernet transparent to the users of the                     graphical front-end.  Students using this laboratory learn                      about power flow, power flow control, contingency analysis,                     economic dispatch, security-constrained dispatch, stability                     analysis, fault analysis, and electromagnetic transients                        analysis.  The new facility: 1) allows learning network                         modeling through per unit representation on one-line diagrams;                  (2) provides a framework for studying the behavior of sample                    networks under steady state and transient conditions; (3)                       allows for control of a power system network for                                economy/security conditions; and (4) provides a means for                       applications of artificial intelligence to improve power system                 operations.",
