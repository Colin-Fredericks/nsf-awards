 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the relationship between vehicle                design, crash characteristics, infrastructure, and driver                       attributes using current databases; the structure of the accident               causation-consequence system via fault-tree analysis; and                       optimization of vehicle design criteria to minimize the risk of                 injury and fatality when constraints on fuel economy, cost, and                 convenience are recognized.  The study will enable structuring                  and classification of knowledge about accident causation and                    crash management using quantitative risk analysis tools and                     methodologies, and allow identification of knowledge gaps that                  are preventing a more complete understanding of the complex                     highway transportation system.  Decision models resulting from                  this work will aid the automobile industry in the selection of                  the optimal crash-avoidance measure under resource constraints in               a timely yet market-focused and cost effective manner.                                                                                                               Several features of the proposed decision making framework                 include the consideration of the multiple conflicting and                       noncommensurable objectives in the optimal design process; the                  allowance of the impact analysis on multiple injury levels and on               various consumer groups; and the recognition of complex system                  interactions.  To achieve the stated objectives two sources of                  expertise will be used:  From academic research recently                        developed and/or enhanced engineering design methodologies                      including fault-tree analysis, multiobjective and trade-off                     analysis, and optimal resource allocation will be used.                         Industrial research will contribute an understanding of the                     biomechanical responses to the physical characteristics of                      various energy-absorbing materials.",
