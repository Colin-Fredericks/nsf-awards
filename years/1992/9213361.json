 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study the ULF wave spectrum at cusp                       stations in conjugate hemispheres.  An auroral observatory                      located at Longyearbyen, Svalbard in the northern hemisphere has                been in operation for nearly a decade and is equipped with                      induction coil and fluxgate magnetometers to measure the ULF wave               spectrum.  The station is also instrumented with all-sky and                    meridian scanning photometers which provide an optical context                  for the magnetic measurements.  In the southern hemisphere, the                 Australian station at Davis, Antarctica is also equipped with                   induction coil and fluxgate magnetometers and has made                          observations of the ULF wave spectrum associated with the cusp                  for several year.  We have begun an echange of data and the                     analysis shows promising correlations.                                                                                                                          It is well known that the cusp region is a rich source of ULF                   waves spanning the frequency spectrum from near dc to above Hz.                 The spectrum consists of an ensemble of waves and variations with               causes ranging from boundary motions and macroscopic boundary                   instabilities at the low frequency end, through impulsive and                   coherent signals with correlation to the solar wind at                          intermediate frequencies, up to an beyond ion-cyclotron waves                   generated in the unstable plasma near the magnetospheric boundary               layers and shocked cusp plasma.  Our work in this analysis is                   aided by through collaboration with the plasma simulation group                 at the Geophysical Institute.                                                                                                                                   Our goal is to collect ULF data at the two sites on a campaign                  basis in order to:                                                              o    investigate the conjugacy of the cusp at these sites;                      o    identify wave generation mechanisms associated with the                         cusp;                                                                      o    inspect the ULF spectrum at the two sites for correlations;                o    identify signatures of flux transfer and particle injection                     at the magnetopause;                                                       o    use the waves as a diagnostic for location of the                               boundaries.",
