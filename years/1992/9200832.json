 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental issue addressed in this work is the structuring  of operating systems to take advantage of multiprocessors so as to  yield the best possible application performance.  The division of  labor between the kernel and the user level is different on a  multiprocessor than on a uniprocessor.  On a uniprocessor, the kernel  is responsible for address spaces, communication, resource allocation,  threads, and thread scheduling.  On a shared memory multiprocessor,  the kernel iis left in charge of address spaces and resource  allocation, but communication, threads, and thread scheduling are  implemented at user level through runtime support in each address  space.  Furthermore, each address space is in direct control  over certain key aspects of virtual memory management and file  management.  It is important to understand that while ``micro-kernel'' designs such  as Mach 3.0 take the important step of moving the file system, the  virtual memory system, etc., out of the kernel to user-level  servers, they leave cross-address space communication, threads, and  thread scheduling in the kernel.  There are structural differences  between these monolithic kernels, micro-kernel designs and the ``nano-kernel''  advocated here.  In experimental work over the past several years, the researchers have  constructed proof-of-concept prototypes in most of the essential areas  that must be addressed:  locking protocols, user-level threads,  cross-address space communication, the kernel interface, processor  allocation policies, and user-level virtual memory management.  The  objectives in this work are of two kinds, direct and indirect.  Direct objectives include:  (1) integrating these proof-of-concept prototypes into a single  system, convincingly demonstrating the viability of the  overall approach; and  (2) solving the problems that stand in the way of this  integration, some of which are known and some of which  can only be discovered by undertaking the task.  Indirect objectives include:  (a) using the ``core'' of the resulting system to study a number  of important policy questions (thread scheduling,  processor allocation, virtual memory management) that can  only be explored given such an experimental testbed, and  (b) using this core as a base for exploring high performance  system support for more advanced architectures,  specifically large scale machines with distributed  memory, distributed/parallel programming using high band-width  low-latency networks, and wide-address machines.",
