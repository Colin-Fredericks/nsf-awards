 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his study of                      problems in complex differential geometry and functions of                      several complex variables. In particular he will attempt to prove               cohomology vanishing theorems under weak positivity assumptions.                He will use curvature methods, positive currents, estimates for                 the d\" operator, and some ideas from the work of Mok and                        Demailly.                                                                            This award will support research in the general area of                    differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry                is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space                and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                  the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of                a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                  these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                        structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                  the large scale structure of the universe.",
