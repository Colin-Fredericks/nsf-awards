 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ideas from algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry have                      contributed to recent advances in symbolic algebra,                             computational number theory, and in the effective geometry of                   real semi-algebraic sets.  In motion-planning and modeling,                     the reintroduction of classical methods of elimination theory                   -- including multivariate resultants, u-resultants and Chow                     forms -- have contributed to the discovery of efficient, and                    efficiently parallelizable, algorithms.  In number theory,                      rational points on abelian varieties defined over finite                        fieldshave provided a rich new source of groups with                            arithmetic properties that can be exploited in the design of                    new algorithms.  Functions on algebraic curves provided a new                   source of error-correcting codes with highly desirable                          features.                                                                                                                                                       This research addresses certain algebraic problems for which                    the methods of algebraic geometry have contributed                              significantly in recent years.  More specifically, the object                   is to study certain computational problems involving algebraic                  curves -- with applications in number theory, cryptography and                  coding theory.  The project will address those methods which                    have been used to design efficient parallel and sequential                      algorithms for these problems, and will consider their broader                  applications in symbolic and algebraic computation.",
