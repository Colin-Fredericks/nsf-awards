 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion that social, cultural, and economic differences                      between immigrants and natives fade over the course of a few                    generations is the essence of the assimilation hypothesis.                      Recent sociological and historical research rejects the                         hypothesis that full assimilation is an unavoidable outcome of                  the ethnic experience.  This literature stresses the fact that                  the United states remains a multicultural, pluralistic society                  and cites as evidence the social, cultural, and economic                        differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups.  The                    purpose of this project is to develop a theoretical and empirical               analysis of why and how these ethnic differences in skills and                  earnings persist across generations.                                                                                                                            The operational hypothesis of the study is that ethnicity acts as               an externality in the human capital accumulation process.  The                  simplest version of this hypothesis states that the skills of the               next generation depend not only parental inputs, but also on the                average quality of the ethnic environment in which these                        investments are made.  The introduction of ethnic capital into an               economic model of intergenerational mobility has an important,                  fundamental implication: ethnic differences and skills and                      earning observed in this generation are likely to persist for                   many generations and these difference may not be amenable to easy               eradication.  This hypothesis will be tested using a number of                  data sets, including the General Social Surveys, the National                   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, and Public Use Samples of the U.S.               Census.",
