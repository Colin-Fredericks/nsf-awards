 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal calls for development, over five years, of a                      national, interactive, telecommunications-supported Network of                  85 or more affiliated neighborhood technology learning centers                  in inner cities and other impoverished areas, for the purpose of                attracting, and then nurturing underserved peoples' active                      involvement with math, science, and technology.                                                                                                                 Network affiliates will provide informal opportunities for                      disadvantaged minority young people and their families and                      friends to get access to, and learn to use, the most powerful                   tool for personal empowerment yet known, to engage in                           explorations designed to increase awareness of their ability to                 do math and science and of the potential for careers in these                   areas, and, through telecommunications, to involve themselves                   with distant peer groups in collaborative investigations.  Such                 opportunities present attractive and cost-effective alternatives                to the dead ends that street life, drugs, incarceration, and/or                 welfare offer.                                                                                                                                                  Success in achieving these goals depends, however, on the                       availability of continuing programmatic and staff development                   assistance, and on the ability of Network members to engage, not                as disparate entities, but as a mutually supportive community,                  in this momentous task.  Proposed Network services include (in                  addition to telecommunications linkages) the identification,                    development, and dissemination of technology-mediated math and                  science activities appropriate to community education,                          consultative planning and technical assistance, staff                           development workshops, the development of a resource database,                  and an annual all-affiliates meeting -- all these to be                         accompanied by systematized self-assessment procedures.  Also                   included is the development of a Network infrastructure to                      support continued existence of the Network beyond the grant                     period.//",
