This research is being conducted                 on                                                                              the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Sites, where                   hurricane blowdowns have been simulated by pulling down canopy                  trees.  Five canopy tree species:  red maple, red oak, black                    birch,                                                                          white birch, and yellow birch will be studied.  The central                     hypothesis is that forest regeneration can be explained in terms                                                                                                                                                                                of species-specific responses to light, temperature, water,                     nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.  Fluxes of these factors in the                   forest understory and on five microsites created by simulated                   hurricane blowdown will be examined.  Patterns of environmental                                                                                                 factors will be related to seed and seedling demography and to                  growth and physiology of individual seedlings.  Changes in the                  understory community following disturbance will also be monitored                                                                                                                                                                               to detect effects of understory vegetation on the forest floor                  environment and on tree regeneration.",
