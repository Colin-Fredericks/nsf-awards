 "awd_abstract_narration": "Singular functional estimation problems cover an extremely                 large portion of statistical theory.  Some procedures with                      optimal rates have been well established; but recent work on                    white noise problems has led to a unified approach based on the                 modulus of the functional.  This approach gives optimal or near                 optimal procedures quite simply for many important statistical                  problems.                                                                            For some statistical estimation problems, optimal methods                  are well known, but for many more either optimality of the                      methodology is uncertain or its efficiency is unknown.  This                    research will produce generally efficient procedures which can                  have many scientific applications, for example complex problems                 like reconstruction of the \"true image\" from tomography or other                imaging techniques. This unified approach to estimation should                  find applications in engineering, biology, economics and other                  fields where practical and theoretical scientific problems are                  framed in terms of statistical models.",
