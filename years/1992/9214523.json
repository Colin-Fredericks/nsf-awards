The space targeted for                              renovation is in the Department of Biochemistry,                                which has been assigned the responsibility to                                   house, operate, and manage an institutional shared                              instrumentation facility for research in molecular                              biology.  Included in the facility will be several                              equipment bays, a tissue culture laboratory, a                                  room for storage and transient disposal of                                      hazardous chemicals (mutagens, solvents,                                        radioisotopes, etc.) and laboratories for new                                   investigators.  One area will be partitioned,                                   furnished, and equipped to provide chromatography                               and centrifugation facilities, a dark-room, a                                   cold-room, and instruments for general sample-                                  handling.  A second area will serve as the Protein                              and Nucleic Acids Chemistry Facility.  The third                                area will be partitioned and renovated to provide                               a multi-user tissue culture laboratory and shared                               space for the storage of hazardous materials and                                preparation for its disposal.  A fourth, very                                   large, room (about 3800 sq. ft) will be                                         partitioned to create laboratories, and shared                                  work areas for three new investigators.                                              This award will allow the modernization of                                 this space so that it is totally usable for                                     biological research.",
