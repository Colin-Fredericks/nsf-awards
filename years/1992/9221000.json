The research will develop                 two experimental methodologies. One is a general approach to                    creating phase-coherent pulse sequences. This will be the first                 optical analog of NMR pulse sequences. It will be used to                       examine the evolution of optical coherence on femtosecond                       timescales. The second methodology involves the direct probing                  of solvent responses to chemical reactions using new nonlinear                  spectroscopies. This involves the measurement of non-resonant                   solvent birefringence responses to chemical evolution during                    the course of a reaction. The purpose is to establish the                       frequencies and types of solvent motion that take place in                      dipolar solvation and photodissociation.                                        %%%                                                                             New methods will be developed for probing the detailed changes                  of structure and energy in molecules during reaction. These                     studies are important because they provide better understanding                 of how to control the outcome of chemical reactions. They may                   have wide application to health related and commercial chemical                 reactions.",
