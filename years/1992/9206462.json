 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on two mutant lines of the yeast,                    Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that respond anomalously to hyperosmotic              stress. The mutants are known as HOG1 and HOG4, because of their                altered cell cycle response in a High Osmolarity Glycerol assay.                The altered genes in these mutants resemble genes that encode a                 group of protein kinases known to be involved in signalling events              during cell growth and division. Osmotic shock is followed by the               tyrosine phosphorylation of the HOG1 protein and suggests that                  osmotic stress responses are mediated by changes in protein                     phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation changes appear to underlie             the signal transduction chain that follows exposure to hypertonic               solutions. The experimental plan is directed toward the                         characterization of intermediate steps in the signal transduction               pathway that involve the HOG1 and HOG4 proteins, and in an analysis             of changes in cell cycle progression in these mutants after                     hypertonic shock.                                                               %%%                                                                                This project is directed toward the study of how cells sense and             respond to osmotic stress. Hyperosmotic treatment in yeast normally             results in cell cycle arrest, but in two recently-discovered                    mutants, arrest does not occur. The altered genes in these mutants              have provided clues to the signal transduction chain that is                    activated during the hyperosmotic stress response. This project                 will provide important information on the signal transduction                   pathway responsible for the osmotic stress response in yeast, and               clues to the underlying regulatory cascades that are activated by               osmotic stress in other kinds of cells.",
