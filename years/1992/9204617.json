 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study pregnancy loss or miscarriages in a                 population of previously nomadic, but now settled, Turkana women                from the semi-arid savanna of northwest Kenya.  Studies of                      Turkana nomadic herders and their settled counterparts in this                  region have been conducted by a team of biological and social                   anthropologists and ecologists for more than a decade.                          Considerable time-depth information has been accumulated on the                 relations of these people, their health, their social behavior,                 and their environment.  The current research, dealing with                      mothers' health and reproduction, has suggested that settled                    Turkana women have a higher pregnancy rate yet fewer live births                than nomadic women.  As a result, the settled women are thought                 to have an unusually high rate of miscarriages.  The work to be                 done in this current study will sample 180 settled Turkana women                who will be followed throughout their pregnancies to detect early               and later miscarriages.  Pregnancies and miscarriages will be                   determined by hormone analysis of urine samples (pregnancy kits).               The results of the research will:  (1) contribute to our general                knowledge of reproduction, as well as to knowledge of those                     factors that influence human fertility in a harsh environment                   with limited resources, and (2) provide information on the                      effects of settlement of nomads on their fertility.",
