 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last thirty years, there has been a burgeoning of                    crime in U.S. inner city neighborhoods.  Over this period, gang                 behavior is believed to have changed, with gangs becoming more                  intensely involved in income earning pursuits, especially in the                sale of drugs.  The level of police control in gang ridden                      neighborhoods has also deteriorated.  This research will use                    recent sociological findings to model crime and gang behavior.                  The resulting theory will be useful in understanding the                        determinants of crime and in evaluating policies geared to halt                 the deterioration of inner cites in the United States.                                                                                                          This project builds on the important recent sociological study by               Martin Sanchez Jankowski, which provides a detailed portrait of                 the operation of teenage gangs in three U.S. cities.  Gangs are                 portrayed as neighborhood militia, whose communities forbear                    their crimes in return for protection they afford against the                   depredation of outsiders.  In contrast, the prevailing economic                 theory of crime, due to Gary Becker, ignores the role of the                    community in determining the level of criminal activity.  This                  research will entail modifying the prevailing economic theory of                crime to include the critical role of the community.  Crime is                  not only due to the behavior of individual offenders, but also to               the community's noncooperation with the police and the police's                 attendant loss of control of criminal activity.                                                                                                                 The theory predicts that in neighborhoods which are sufficiently                rich, crime will not pay; in poorer neighborhoods, however, crime               will pay, and the police will lose control in the sense that the                community will not cooperate.  Nevertheless, police monitoring                  and legal penalties still affect criminal activity.  Crime is                   largely determined by the threshold at which the community will                 switch from protecting their neighborhood gangs to helping the                  police.  A model is developed to analyze alternative crime                      control measures and to expand the research to study the                        interrelationships among crime and other inner city problems such               as the disappearance of jobs, increased homelessness and the                    breakdown in family relations.",
