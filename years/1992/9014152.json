 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Robert L. Kosut of                           Integrated Systems Incorporated, Santa Clara, California, to                    the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, to                     work with Dr. Prof. Brian D.O. Anderson of the Systems                          Engineering Department, Australian National University,                         Canberra, on adaptive robust control.  The authors will                         investigate the implications of the classical averaging                         analysis method to the design of nonlinear adaptive control                     systems.  In connection with this, they will study the                          problem of robust adaptive control, in which estimated                          inaccuracy regions for the estimated parameters play an                         important role in the design.  The researchers point out that                   while it is easy to construct an adaptive system by connecting                  a design rule and an estimator together, it is very difficult                   to ensure by analysis that the resulting adaptive system will                   provide acceptable performance.  They plan to eliminate                         problems from the start by digital control of nonlinear                         sampled-data systems.  They will investigate the performance                    of the resulting controller in the context of robotic                           mechanisms.  To perform this task, they will use: (1)                           averaging analysis of adaptive control systems; and (2)                         adaptive system synthesis via uncertainty estimation.  In                       both cases, they state current results obtained for linear                      systems, and argue how the same approaches will be used for                     nonlinear systems.",
