The developing courses are focusing on concept                   development, understanding, applications, and the use of                        technology to enhance learning. Materials being developed as a                  part of the Five Colleges Calculus project are being adapted                    and site tested as a part of this activity. Approximately 700                   students, the majority being female, continuing education and                   mathematics education students, are enrolled in mathematics                     courses at Aquinas each year and are benefiting from this                       laboratory and these approaches.",
