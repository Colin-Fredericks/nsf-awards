The                                                    problems of particular concern are                                              assignment of software to computers                                             jobs to avoid unbalanced loads, and                                             dynamic scheduling of jobs assigned                                             to a set of identical processors.                                               Resolution of these problems is                                                 vital to progress from networked                                                heterogeneous computing                                                         environments to a \"meta-computer,\"                                              i.e., an efficient, convenient                                                  computing environment which                                                     automatically allocates job among a                                             variety of available computers.
