 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complicated geographical variations in color pattern                   within species of Heliconius butterflies have piqued the interest               of biologists for more than a century. The advent of simple                     molecular biological techniques has provided researchers with a                 new source of data to interpret these patterns, including the                   complex array of mimetic forms which have defied explanation till               now. A survey of intraspecific variation in DNA of Heliconius                   species will provide an independent hypothesis of the history of                colonization and divergence among the geographical races within                 each species.                                                                        Under the guidance of faculty sponsor Richard Harrison,                    graduate student Andrew Brower will collect butterflies in South                America and then conduct laboratory analyses of morphological and               molecular features of these samples. The data will contribute to                distinguishing between two major explanations for the patterns of               wing color patterns: allopatric divergence during the Pleistocene,              or parapatric divergence due to natural selection across narrow                 ecological clines. As well, the study will advance modern attempts              to disentangle historical, phylogenetic causes of change from                   current ecological adaptations that also lead to change over short              time spans.",
