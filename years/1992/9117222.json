 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three experiments to be conducted address basic                        questions about the forces that shape genetic variation in                      populations.  Drosophila is the model organism because it is will               studied and highly suitable for molecular approaches.  Recent                   work has revealed that there is remarkably little molecular                     polymorphism in regions of the genome that have relatively little               genetics recombination.  The most promising theory to account for               this is that favorable mutants occasionally move through the                    population, removing polymorphisms in a large region that lacks                 recombination.  The proposed experiments attempt to test some of                the quantitative predictions of this theory.  Another experiment                investigates whether polymorphism is a \"process pseudogene.\"                    Since this type of gene is thought to have no function, the study               of such a gene will give important baseline data on a part of the               genome that is \"free\" from the force of natural selection.  The                 third experiment is designed to test a prediction of a  theory                  that accounts for the containment of copy numbers of transposable               elements (DNA parasites) in natural populations.  This theory and               the observed distributions of transposable elements predicts that               there will be high levels of unequal crossing over near the tips                of the X chromosome in Drosophila.  The proposed experiments will               directly measure the frequency of unequal (ectopic) exchange in                 this region of the genome.  The results from these experiments                  should advance our theoretical understanding of the impact of                   various recombinational and mutational processes on standing                    variation.  This theoretical area of knowledge is often the                     foundation for the interpretation of practically important and/or               theoretically interesting genetic variation in humans and other                 organisms of economic or basic interest.",
