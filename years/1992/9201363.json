 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator on this award will consider the                 following local questions in commutative algebra.  (1) Is the                   symbolic algebra of a monomial prime P(a,b,c) finitely generated?               (2) Is there a solution to the Riemann-Roch problem for high                    powers of a nef divisor on a nonsingular projective variety of                  dimension greater than or equal to three?  (3) Suppose that R and               S are regular local rings with the same quotient field K, and V                 is a valuation ring of K such that V dominates R and S?  Is there               a regular local ring T such that T can be obtained from both R                  and S by sequences of monodial transformations, and such that V                 dominates T?                                                                         This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
