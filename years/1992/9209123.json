 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this proposal will                                    establish a scientific framework which gives insight                            into the design of nonlinear actuators.  This will be                           accomplished through the expansion of nonlinear                                 system theory and the proper formulation of                                     nonlinear models for electromagnetic actuators,                                 allowing for their deterministic optimal design.                                Additional contributions are expected in the fields                             of nonlinear system theory and electromechanical                                interactions.  This work will develop the necessary                             expansions to nonlinear system theory so that a                                 linearization and decoupling between performance                                measures and design parameters may be achieved                                  for electromagnetic actuators.  The design                                      parameters could include the number of stator and                               rotor poles, the stator and rotor pole arcs, the                                active radius, the axial length, etc.  The                                      performance measures could include the average                                  torque as a function  of speed, the torque-ripple,                              inertia, etc.  The running example to be used                                   throughout this work is the design of the variable-                             reluctance motor.  This motor has already has                                   nonlinear control techniques applied to it, and it is                           a difficult motor to design because of its spatial and                          magnetic nonlinearities.  The work proposed here is                             significantly different from applying linearizing                               control laws.  In this project, the system theory                               would be exploited to yield a closed form optimal                               design.  This is a natural extension of previous                                modeling work and will directly address important                               design issues.  In addition, the incorporation of                               nonlinear system theory represents a departure                                  from all documented design work and if successful,                              could completely reorient the way the design                                    problem is viewed.  Further, the design process                                 would benefit from the discipline the system theory                             approach would impose on it.",
