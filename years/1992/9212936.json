 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the effects of the social structure on                        stratification is largely based on information about Western                    capitalist societies.  The different nations and regions of the                 former Soviet Union provide a diversity of forms of planned                     economy.  This diversity in combination with the extraordinary                  recent political and socioeconomic changes permits a new                        opportunity for deepening our understanding of the effect of social             structure on stratification.  This proposal will assemble a data                set in preparation for a study of the transition from dependency                to adult roles of people born between 1966 and 1968 in the Soviet               Union.  These individuals were educated in a fully-developed                    socialist society, completed secondary education during the period              of Perestroika (1983-1985), and began their job careers during the              transition from socialism to a new political and economic system.               Specifically, a longitudinal data set on 20,000 secondary school                graduates in 13 different regions of the former Soviet Union will               be assembled and verified in preparation for a study of the                     influence of social structural variables on early life course                   transitions.                                                                                                                                                         This project will contribute to our understanding of how                   societal institutions shape people's lives, and it will thus help               to counterbalance the emphasis in the U.S. literature on how                    individual characteristics shape people's lives.  The timing and                geographic locations of the longitudinal data collections to be                 completed and assembled in single data set provide a unique                     opportunity for studying early life careers.",
