 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports the research of Dr. Michael Lattman of the                     Chemistry Department, Southern Methodist University, on the                     chemistry of hypervalent main group elements and some                           transition metals.  Elements are described as \"hypervalent\"                     when they are formally surrounded by more than eight electrons                  and contain a three-center four-electron bond.  Lattman will                    investigate the behavior of these elements with nitrogen- and                   oxygen-containing macrocycles, specifically members of the                      cyclen and calixarene families.  Basic relationships of ring                    size, atomic size and geometry will be determined, as will                      amphiprotic behavior.  Some metals will be placed in                            phosphorylated calixarene \"baskets.\"                                            %%%                                                                             Large cyclic organic molecules which contain nitrogen or oxygen                 can use electrons available on the nitrogen or oxygen to bond                   to metals or other elements.  Factors such as ring size and                     position of the heteroatom impose geometric constraints on the                  molecule formed, making it possible to stabilize atoms in                       unsual geometries or oxidation states and to influence their                    reactivity.  Lattman will study some elements in unusual                        environments to obtain fundamental information on their                         behavior.  It is possible that the results may be relevant to                   the stabilization of heterobimetallic compounds, shape                          selective catalysis, and nonlinear optical behavior.",
