 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two three-month visits by Dr. Simon D. Silver               of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago over               a two-year period to the University of Melbourne, Australia, to                 perform laboratory work with Dr. Barry Thomas Owen Lee on copper                resistance plasmid in Escherichia coli.  The researchers will                   characterize in detail 64Cu2+ transport in whole cells, right-                  side out, and inverted membrane vehicles from wild type E. coli                 K-12 and with a series of mutant strains defective in copper                    uptake, efflux and homeostasis that already have been isolated                  and preliminary characterized by the Melbourne group.  These                    mutations are both in chromosomal genes (cut) required for normal               cellular nutrition and in plasmid genes (pco) governing                         resistance to high toxic copper levels.  The kinetic parameters                 (Km, Vmax, Ki's for alternative substrates) will be determined                  for the apparently two chromosomally-determined copper uptake                   pathways.  If the vesicle assays work, then these will be free of               complications of cell-wall binding and also intracellular binding               by copper-homeostasis proteins hypothesized by the Camakaris/Lee                group.  Similarly uptake kinetics will be measured with inside-                 out vesicles produced by French Press disruption, as has been                   done in other laboratories for other cations.  Alternative                      substrates for uptake, especially related divalent cations, will                be tested both as inhibitors of 64Cu2+ uptake and as radioactive                substrates in transport assays.  From such detailed cation                      transport kinetics the researchers expect to piece together a                   complex picture of perhaps two uptake pathways, plus a single                   chromosomal- and plasmid-determined efflux pathway, and in                      addition genes determining intracellular copper-binding proteins                that function both in storage and in passage of newly accumulated               Cu2+ to either its intracellular sites or to the efflux system.",
