 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project SMART Assessments (scientific and Mathematical                          Arenas for Refining Thinking) combines assessment models and                    extends them via technology for teleconferencing to create                      frequent, intrinsically motivating assessment strategies.                       SMART assessment involve a series of stages focused on a                        Challenge Series in which students work on problems that are                    imbedded into an instructional unit.  Students use gained                       knowledge to evaluate answers and arguments in a live video                     teleconference format.  They receive immediate feedback and                     then work on new problems with the opportunity to respond                       again in a second Challenge Series teleconference program.                      A series of studies will evaluate the design features of                        SMART assessments and how these features enhance learning                       and the quality of teaching in the areas of science and                         mathematics.  The model will be applied across curricular                       areas to establish its generalizability.  Initial                               application is to mathematics, in particular to the NSF                         funded Adventures of Jasper Woodbury Series.  The model will                    then be applied to two other programs in science and                            mathematics.  Major outcomes from the project will be:  (1)                     a documented set of assessment design procedures with                           examples of applications to the three curricula emphasizing                     problem solving and reasoning in mathematics and science;                       (2)  data from research studies investigating the                               implementation of such procedures in multiple classrooms                        with different teacher and student characteristics; (3)                         data on the impact of such assessment procedures on                             instructional program outcomes; (4) analyses of the                             implications of the assessment for psychometric modeling and                    measurement.",
