 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of young U.S. faculty                        researchers in the area of robotics to attend an International                  Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) to be held                    during November, 1991, in Osaka, Japan.  Professor Daniel E.                    Koditschek, Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University,              is the U.S. organizer.  He is cooperating with a number of                      Japanese researchers at university, government and corporate                    laboratories who have agreed to serve as hosts for the U.S.                     researchers.  At the conclusion of the Workshop each host institute             will sponsor a day long site visit and lecture by a U.S. researcher             at their facility.  In addition to attending the regular IROS                   Workshop sessions the young researchers will also attend several                special sessions in which they have been accepted to present their              papers.                                                                                                                                                         The area of science is very important in both countries.  All the               organizers are well-known and capable.  The IROS Workshop will                  provide the U.S. researchers the opportunity of interacting with                Japan's most powerful university, corporate and academic leaders                in the robotics area.  Since research in the robotics area has                  recently slowed in the U.S. it is important to be increasingly aware            of the advances currently underway in Japanese research                         establishments.  The Workshop should also offer the U.S.                        researchers a unique opportunity for pursuing research ties with                Japanese scientists in an attempt to facilitate long-term                       collaboration, to the mutual benefit of both the U.S. and Japan.",
