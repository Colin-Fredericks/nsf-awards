 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the stability and reactivity of a variety                   of radical species generated from azo compounds will be                         conducted. Reaction mechanisms will be established by the use                   of a variety of techniques including electroanalytical methods,                 laser flash photolysis, calorimetry, preparative and                            quantitative photochemistry, and ESR. The projects to be                        investigated will include: (1) assessment of the stability of                   azaallyl radicals and the factors which determine their                         recombination to yield dimers; (2) determination of the                         lifetimes of cyclic biradicals using a free radical clock; and                  (3) elucidation of the detained mechanism of the oxidation of                   azoalkanes by stable cation radical salts. The project will                     involve both the synthesis of a variety of novel azo compouunds                 as well as precise calculations of rate processes and the                       determination of the identity of reactive intermediates.                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Paul S. Engel at Rice University.                  These studies will be center around the reactions and inherent                  stabilities of radical species which are generated upon                         exposure of certain chemical compounds to either heat or light.                 In order to ascertain the nature of these radical species,                      which exist for only a few billionths of a second, a variety of                 sophisticated methods will be utilized. By understanding the                    stability of these intermediate compounds, it will be possible                  to devise similar systems that will be more efficient and                       result in faster reactions. This is particularly important                      since the base compounds to be investigated represent a class                   of chemical substances which have found widespread use in a                     variety of industrial applications involving the processing of                  plastics and foams.",
