 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is recognized that soil-structure interaction during strong                  earthquake ground shaking alters the response characteristics of                a structural system.  However there are no strong-motion data                   from instrumented buildings to confirm the validity of the                      soil-structure interaction analysis methods and procedures; even                though the effects of this interaction are now included in                      various seismic codes (e.g. ATC-3, NEHRP-1985).  Workshops held                 between 1978 and the present have repeatedly included the                       recommendation to instrument a building for soil-structure                      interaction studies.  Although there are over 100 structures in                 the U.S. instrumented to measure the effects of strong earthquake               ground shaking, there are no instrumented structures that would                 allow detailed calibration and/or confirmation of the validity of               soil-structure interaction analysis methods.  The objective of                  this workshop is to plan for and to design such an experiment,                  which is being undertaken by the U.S. Geological Survey.                                                                                                        This action is for support of this initiative by the National                   Science Foundation.  The purposes of this workshop are:  (a) to                 bring together a panel of experts to reach a consensus on the                   benefits and feasibility of implementing a soil-structure                       interaction experiment by instrumenting a building in a                         seismically-active region of the U.S., and (b) to plan the                      details for such an experiment.",
