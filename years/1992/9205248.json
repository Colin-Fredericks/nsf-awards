 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to understand both how               proteins recognize specific DNA sequences, and how the recognition              mechanisms are varied to accommodate the functional requirements of             the protein.  To that end, a combination of mutant characterization             and protein biochemistry will be used to study three functionally               disparate DNA-binding proteins which all come from the Pvu II                   restriction-modification system.  The first of these proteins is                the Pvu II DNA methyltransferase, which binds S-adenosylmethionine              and the DNA duplex sequence CAGCTG and methylates the amino group               of the internal cytosine.  The second protein is the Pvu II                     restriction endonuclease, which binds the same DNA sequence and                 Mg++ and catalyzes phosphodiester cleavage between the central two              bases.  The third protein is the Pvu II C protein, which appears to             have a more degenerate recognition specificity on the DNA and                   activates transcription of the endonuclease gene.  The immediate                goals are to identify the domains and amino acids that play key                 roles in recognizing the substrate DNA sequence and the other                   substrates as well.  Understanding sequence-specific recognition of             DNA by proteins, particularly when a catalytic center must be                   brought into proximity with the DNA, is an important goal both for              a sophisticated understanding of gene expression and for the                    further development of biotechnology.                                           %%%                                                                             The two long-term goals of this project are to understand how                   proteins recognize specific DNA base sequences despite the large                excess of nonsubstrate DNA in the cell, and how these sequence                  recognition mechanisms vary to accommodate the other functional                 requirements of the protein when a catalytic center must be brought             close to the DNA to carry out reactions.  Understanding sequence-               specific recognition of DNA by proteins is an important goal both               for fully understanding the control of gene expression, and for the             further development of biotechnology.  In this study, a combination             of mutagenesis and protein biochemistry will be used to study three             DNA-binding proteins which all come from the Pvu II restriction-                modification system but which each have very different fuctions.                The first of these proteins is the Pvu II DNA methlytransferase,                which binds S-adenosylmethionine and the DNA duplex sequence CAGCTG             and methylates the amino group of the internal cytosine.  The                   second protein is the Pvu II restriction endonuclease, which binds              the same DNA sequence an Mg++ and catalyzes phosphodiester cleavage             between the central two bases.  The third protein is the Pvu II C               protein, which appears to bind the Pvu II DNA and activate                      transcription of the endonuclease gene.  The immediate goals are to             identify the domains and amino acids of these three proteins that               play key roles in recognizing the substrate DNA sequence, in                    recognizing the other substrates, and in carrying out the chemical              reactions of methylation or cleavage.",
