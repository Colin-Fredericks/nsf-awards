 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Dr. Wilson's research is to understand neural                       mechanisms of associative learning.  Specifically, the proposed                 research will investigate the neural substrates of postnatal                    olfactory learning in newborn vertebrates.  This early learning is              associated with specific changes in neural structure and function               in the olfactory bulb, the first central relay for olfactory                    information processing.  Dr. Wilson's previous work has                         demonstrated the output neurons in the olfactory bulb,                          mitral/tufted cells, modify their response patterns to odors                    learned during the early postnatal period.  Furthermore, Dr. Wilson             has found that mitral/tufted cells receive convergent information               about both odor stimuli and reward stimuli.  Importantly, both the              behavioral and neural consequences of early learning are                        morepinephrine dependent, as is at least one component of                       mitral/tufted cell response to reward.  The proposed experiments                will examine how mitral/tufted cells are modified during olfactory              associative learning and uses a combination of neurophysiological               and neuropharmacological techniques to further explore the neural               substrates of the descending reward input to the olfactory bulb.                Based on his preliminary data, a specific circuit is proposed for               convergence of odor and reward information in the bulb involving                the primary olfactory nerve and norepinephrine centrifugal inputs               to the bulb.  Norepinephrine agonists and antagonists will be                   infused into the olfactory bulb during odor-reward associative                  conditioning.  Response patterns of mitral/tufted cells to the                  conditioned odor will be examined over the course of the training.              The results will provide important information regarding the neural             pathways and pharmacology involved in a critical form of learning               expressed soon after birth in many animals including humans.***//",
