 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient movement into estuaries and the resulting effects on                   primary productivity, the depletion of oxygen, habitat structure,               and trophic changes in coastal waters have dominated estuarine                  research for decades.  Another, and neglected, linkage between land             and coastal waters is the input of dissolved and particulate                    organic carbon and organic nitrogen. Organic nitrogen inputs are                frequently greater than inorganic nitrogen inputs and in many cases             the input of organic carbon from land is greater than the in situ               production of organic carbon.  Despite the quantitative importance              of organic matter inputs from land, there is little data on its                 actual use in coastal waters and even less data on effects of                   organic matter loading on coastal ecosystem structure and function.             Recent developments in the chemical analysis of dissolved organic               C and N and stable isotope tracer technology now make it possible               to refine the input-output budgets and also address the fate and                importance of organic matter entering coastal waters from land.                 Two broad questions addressed in this project are: (1) What is the              importance to estuarine ecosystems of organic carbon and organic                nitrogen inputs from watersheds with various land covers and uses?              and  (2) Does the interaction of inorganic nutrients with the                   quantity and quality of organic carbon and organic nitrogen play an             important role in determining the trophic structure, production,                and trophic efficiency in estuaries?                                                                                                                            This project will attempt to answer these questions through                     measurements of the quantity of dissolved and particulate organic               carbon and organic nitrogen entering coastal waters from land,                  through experiments to determine the effects of various nutrient                and organic matter inputs and interactions on the flow and                      recycling of C and N through pelagic and benthic food webs                      including higher trophic levels, and through modeling of food chain             transformations and the effects of changes in land use and land                 cover.  The proposed research integrates estuarine biogeochemistry              with studies of food webs and population biology of higher trophic              levels.  Site-specific research will be focused in the Plum Island              Sound System of the cold-water Acadian Biogeographic Province in                northern New England.  This projects seeks conclusions and models               that are applicable across a wide range of coastal waters;                      hypothesis testing of specific questions across ecosystems is the               most effective way to achieve this goal. This project will combine              experimental studies in the Plum Island Sound Ecosystem with                    comparative studies at different coastal sites (LMER/LTER) chosen               to represent end-members in an analysis of interactions between                 organic matter and inorganic nutrient loading.",
