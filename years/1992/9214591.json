 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student from NYU studying the tension between local                and national cultural identities in France.  The student will do                an intensive case study of a regional volunteer theater group,                  which attempts to present artistic works representing national                  \"culture\" while interpreting them in a way to support the local                 (regional) culture.  The study will focus on the tension between                the group's representation of national and local culture.                                                                                                       This research is important because the nature of national                       cultural integration in modern nation states is not well                        understood.  The recent destruction of states like Yugoslavia                   show that local and regional cultural interests can remain vital                and alive over many years.  This sort of cultural study will show               how such ideas and values are instituted in a local culture in                  contradiction to the influences from the national center.",
