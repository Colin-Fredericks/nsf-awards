 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project gives 40 participants from the southwestern section of             the country intensive exposure to personal productivity and                     teaching enhancement software applicable to undergraduate physics               courses.  The workshop is conducted by experts from New Mexico                  State University, which has a program to introduce more computer                usage to its undergraduate curriculum.  The participants are                    selected from two and four year colleges from the region with                   preference given to those from institutions serving significant                 numbers of Hispanic and Native American students.  During the week              the participants listen to experts discuss and demonstrate the                  capabilities of various computer programs.  In the afternoons, the              participants actually use the software to create applications for               their own courses.  A newsletter produced from the applications                 created by the participants insures that good ideas are given wide              distribution.  The objective of the workshop is to introduce a                  significant number of undergraduate faculty to the capabilities and             operation of various computer programs which can enhance the                    teaching of their courses.",
