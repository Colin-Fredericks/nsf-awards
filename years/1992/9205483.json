 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal of a 2-year project whose overall goal is                to study downstream fining by aggradation and selective deposition              in gravels.  The main results so far have produced downstream                   fining by a factor of two in a channel 50 m long and 0.3 m wide at              the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory (SAFHL), demonstrating               unequivocally that selective deposition is an effective fining                  mechanism and that it can be studied in laboratory experiments.                 In parallel experiments at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a novel              colored-grain system is providing the fractional-transport data                 base needed to perdict the fining observed at SAFHL.  This phrase               now involves a series of runs a SAFHL with a channel width of 2.0               m; this will produce braided topography, enabling invesitgation of              the effect of lateral sorting and topography on downstream fining.              The present fractional-transport program at JHU, will continue                  adding components on the effect of sediment feed versus                         recirculation and the influence of small-scale sedimentary                      features.  Finally, a concurrent set of runs at MIT to examine                  local lateral sorting in a 1.0 m wide channel as well as the                    effects of varying deposit geometry and percent extraction is                   planned.  This research seems as the first real connection between              engineering hydraulics and fluvial sedimentology and represents                 fundamental research related to sediment transport mechanics.",
