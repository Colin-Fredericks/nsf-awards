 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University                   in conjunction with the American Political Science Association                  is conducting a three-week summer (1992) workshop on the                        teaching and research applications of statistical data                          analysis.  The general objective is to enhance the instruction                  of undergraduates in the research practices of political                        scientists with access to a large variety of individual and                     aggregate, citizen and leader data on political and related                     phenomena.  This includes data on a number of democratic                        nations, international relations, elections of members of state                 legislators, voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential                          elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court.  The American Political                  Science Association is assisting this project by assuring                       access to the workshop, evaluating its effectiveness and                        impact, and disseminating its instructional strategies and                      materials to all political science faculty.",
