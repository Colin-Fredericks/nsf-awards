 "awd_abstract_narration": "The term \"neurosecretion\" refers to the fact that certain nerve                 fibers release biologically active substances into the blood stream             which are then able to influence the activities of distant target               organs.  The lower portion of the spinal cord of fishes contains                such a neurosecretory system.  The nerves synthesize two peptides               (small proteins) known as urotensin I and urotensin II.  The                    urotensins were first isolated from bony fishes (teleosts) but                  despite intensive study, their importance in the physiology of                  these fish is not understood.  The laboratories of Dr. Conlon and               Hazon are proposing a new animal model in which to investigate the              physiological roles of the urotensins.  We will purify urotensin                I and II from an extract of the spinal cord of a cartilaginous                  fish, the European common dogfish and determine their chemical                  structures.  We will then synthesize several milligrams of the                  peptides in order to determine their biological actions in the                  dogfish.  Using free swimming fish that have been fitted with a                 cannula in an artery, we will investigate the effects of the                    dogfish urotensins on blood pressure and on the production of                   steroids.  The blood of the dogfish, like other members of the                  shark family, contains a very high concentration of urea which is               important in  maintaining an equilibrium between the fish's body                fluids and the surrounding sea water.  We will investigate the                  effects of the urotensins upon the levels of urea and other blood               constituents in the dogfish.  We will prepare strips of smooth                  muscle from the various organs and blood vessels of the dogfish and             study the abilities of the urotensins either to relax or contract               these muscles.  Finally, we hope to gain insight into the sites of              action of the urotensins by tagging the molecules with a                        radioactive label and determining which organs in the dogfish                   recognize and bind the peptides.  In this way, we hope to build up              an overall picture of the roles of  the urotensins in regulating                the physiology of a cartilaginous fish.  This knowledge will be                 valuable in future investigations that will assess the roles of the             urotensins in other classes of vertebrate.",
