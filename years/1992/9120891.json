Stephen Berry at the University of Chicago that is                 investigating several related topics.  One goal is the                          elucidation of the dynamics of clusters, particularly phase                     changes in clusters and their relationship to bulk phase                        transitions.  A related topic deals with surface melting and                    the development of an analytic theory of sintering and a                        quantifiable model for the disappearance of grain boundaries                    during sintering.  A third area concerns computation of                         rotation-vibration levels of small polyatomic molecules.                        %%%                                                                             Small clusters of tens to thousands of atoms provide an                         intermediate between isolated molecules, which have been                        extensively studied by chemists, and the condensed states of                    matter, which present many complicated features.  The work of                   Professor Berry deals mainly with study of this intermediate                    scale of organization with the goal of learning basic                           principles that will be useful in macroscopic applications to                   bulk materials.",
