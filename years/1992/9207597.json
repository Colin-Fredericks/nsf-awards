 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of this proposal brings strengths from molecular                biology, cytogenetics, and cladistics to test the hypothesis that               rapid chromosomal change and karyotypic stasis are primarily                    mediated at the molecular level by activity of repetitive                       sequences.  We predict that taxa with radically reorganized                     karyotypes will have:  1) an abundance of copies and classes of                 rapidly evolving repetitive sequences;2) tandemly repeated                      sequences will have actively changed chromosomal fields among                   nonhomologous chromosomes; and 3) interspersed repeated sequences               will have undergone changes in sequence and copy number due to                  transposition.  Alternatively, lineages experiencing long periods               of karyotypic stasis will have:  1) fewer classes of tandemly                   repeated sequences is low copy number; 2) tandemly repeated                     sequences restricted to specific chromosomal regions; and 3)                    interspersed elements will evolve at a rate similar to that of                  other neutral DNA, due to a lower rate of transposition.  New                   World leaf-nosed bats were chosen because monophyly of taxa to be               studied is well documented and they exhibit extremes in rates and               types of karyotypic evolution.  Methods of examination will                     include phylogenetic screening of genome libraries to determine                 the number and kind of rapidly evolving repetitive sequences.                   Chromosomal position and movement will be documented by                         cladistical analysis of data from in situ hybridization.",
