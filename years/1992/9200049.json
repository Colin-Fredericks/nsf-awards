 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides ongoing funds to the Department of Psychology               at Kent State University to support eight Junior-class level                    participants in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.              One of these will be a Kent State student, while the remaining                  seven will be selected from nominees provided by specified liberal-             arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  Designated             faculty members from the Psychology Departments of collaborating                institutions have agreed to serve as project coordinators to assist             in the initiation, organization, and follow-up of student research              activity associated with program operation.                                                                                                                     Student selection involves nomination by home faculty and a                     familiarization visit to Kent (at Kent's expense) for interview and             introduction of project opportunities.  Fourteen topics are                     available for choice with the restriction that advisors and                     students be matched one-to-one.  Competitively selected awardees                work with their individual advisor and engage in training, travel               to other institutions, and informational exchange with other                    participants during ten summer weeks.  Follow-up of analysis and                reporting will be monitored by the Project Director and local                   coordinators during the ensuing Fall term.",
