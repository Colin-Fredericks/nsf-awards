 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 metallic Chemistry Program, deals with the mechanistic based                    development of catalysts for alkane carbonylation and the                       reverse process, aldehyde decarbonylation.  Several approaches                  to the development of catalytic systems will be studied                         including novel radical-based photochemical and thermal                         systems, photochemically activated trans-carbonylchloro-                        bis(trimethylphosphine)rhodium(I), and other thermally                          activated compounds of rhodium and ruthenium.  Both experi-                     mental and theoretical approaches to catalyst design will be                    utilized.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Selective functionalization of hydrocarbons under mild                          conditions remains as one of the most significant, but elusive,                 goals of modern chemistry.  The technological implications of                   selective, and energy-efficient reactions of hydrocarbons are                   enormous.  Recent discoveries by organo- metallic chemists have                 indicated that certain transition metal complexes will react                    with hydrocarbons under mild conditions.  This project will                     attempt to extend these earlier studies to generate catalytic                   cycles in which metallated hydrocarbons react with carbon                       monoxide to produce aldehydes, which can serve as precursors to                 a wide variety of other types of compounds.",
