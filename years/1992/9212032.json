 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent published results show that fractal geometry can be                      effectively used to model the skewness and degree of self-                      similarity exhibited by the memory-access patterns generated                    by processors.  The fact that the fractal model can be used to                  predict the behavior of programs at many levels of the memory                   hierarchy, and that the performance of those levels can be in                   turn predicted, implies that memory access patterns are highly                  structured.                                                                                                                                                     Unfortunately, this structure is also highly irregular, and                     the vast majority of models that have been proposed to                          simulate program behavior must rely on over-simplifying and                     unrealistic assumptions of uniformity of access and/or of                       independence of access.  Some preliminary results show that                     under some conditions, in particular when a process is                          allocated too little cache storage, its memory access pattern                   results in chaos in the cache, yielding poor cache                              performance.                                                                                                                                                    This research investigates the conditions under which chaos                     occurs, how cache design parameters influence it, how chaotic                   behavior influences cache performance, and applies these                        results to threading and cache partitioning, two methodologies                  that present potentially favorable conditions for chaos to                      appear.",
