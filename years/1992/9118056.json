 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mount Erebus is the most active volcano in Antarctica having been               in a continuous eruptive state throughout this century.  The                    volcano is unique in containing a persistent convecting lava lake               composed of highly alkalic anorthoclase phonolite magma.                        Eruptive activity from the lava lake and adjacent vents has                     consisted of minor strombolian eruptions which occasionally eject               volcanic bombs to heights of over 500 meters.  Recent work has                  also shown Mount Erebus to be an important source of aerosols to                the pristine Antarctic atmosphere.  It is likely that Erebus                    contributes significant quantities of Chlorine, Fluorine and                    other trace components to the snow falling on the East Antarctic                ice sheet.  This has important consequences to chemists who are                 trying to decipher paleoenvironments from snow and ice core                     analyses.  This award supports the establishment of the Mount                   Erebus Volcano Observatory at McMurdo Station to allow continued                surveillance of Mount Erebus.  This will contribute greatly of an               understanding of the degassing behavior of an \"open vent\"                       volcano.  Measurements of Sulfur Dioxide emissions made at  Mount               Erebus between 1983 and 1991 are amongst the most extensive and                 detailed made at any volcano in long periods if a complete                      understanding of the degassing and eruptive behavior of this                    unique volcano and its magnetic system is going to be obtained.",
