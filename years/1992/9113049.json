 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is not unusual in the chemical industry to initiate the                      first design study within one week of a chemist's,                              biochemist's, microbiologist's or polymer scientist's                           discovery of a new reaction system or a new material.  The                      goals of this first design are to see if the process is                         profitable, to see if environmental problems will be                            encountered, to determine the best few process flowsheets, and                  to guide the development of a database that is needed for a                     final design.  Thus, the focus is on understanding the                          problem, rather than obtaining a rigorous solution.  For this                   reason, short-cut models normally are used for the evaluations                  in the initial study, and then rigorous design calculations                     are introduced in subsequent design studies after the best                      alternatives have been identified.  The method can be                           approximated on the computer by using hierarchical methods,                     going from a conceptual design to a detailed design to a final                  design.                                                                                                                                                         This work involves automatic implementation of the first step,                  the conceptual design phase of the procedure.  In this stage,                   the designer identifies the possible process alternatives,                      selects process units, identifies possible pollution problems,                  etc.  This conceptual design problem is often characterized by                  a very large number of possible processes that can use a given                  reaction chemistry to transform the raw materials to the                        desired product (and some by-products).  Both a large number                    of structural alternatives (that is, equipment selection and                    streams), as well as values of the design variables (which                      effect the stream flows and equipment sizes) are encountered.                   Rules based on artificial intelligence will be developed to                     choose between these numerous alternatives.  Specifically, the                  PI plans to develop new synthesis procedures for  the                           separation of vapor-liquid-liquid-solid mixtures that will                      make the hierarchical decision procedure applicable to the                      conceptual design of most chemical processes.  The code he                      plans to develop will include a systematic procedure for                        exploring process alternatives, as well as the quick screening                  of these alternatives; and, be a good starting point for more                   detailed algorithmic synthesis studies (mixed integer                           nonlinear programming and simulated annealing).  The code will                  also indicate when pollution problems will result from the                      design decisions and suggest process alternatives to avoid                      environmental problems.  In addition, the software will be                      shared with other undergraduate and graduate institutions (it                   is to be distributed by the CACHE Corporation) to be used for                   the teaching of process design.",
