 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fungi have been demonstrated to play key roles in mediating energy              flow in the detritus-based food chains in streams.  Until recently,             however, there have been no methods available that would allow                  determination of instantaneous growth rates of fungi in any                     environment.  Consequently, quantitative data concerning fungal                 production or flow of energy through the fungal community are not               available.  A method for estimating instantaneous growth rates of               natural fungal communities by determining rates of incorporation                of 14C-acetate into ergosterol was recently described.  The                     proposed studies are designed to adapt and evaluate this method for             use on the leaf-decomposing fungal communities in streams.                      Laboratory studies will establish optimum conditions for the                    incorporation of acetate into ergosterol and determine factors for              converting incorporation rates into growth rates of individual                  fungal species.  Laboratory studies of individual species growing               on leaf material will be used to compare estimates of growth rates              and production determined by the 14C-acetate method with production             estimates determined independently from changes in fungal biomass,              respiration and conidium production.  The method will then be used              to estimate growth rates and production of fungal communities                   during the decomposition of leaves in two streams that differ in                water chemistry.  These results will be compared with other                     measures of activity including total microbial respiration, total               microbial biomass and sporulation rates of stream fungi.  These                 studies will contribute to the assessment of a new method that has              the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of              fungal activities in the environment and should contribute needed               information concerning the productivity of fungi in streams.",
