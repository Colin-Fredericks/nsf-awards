 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Van Hook is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 and Computational Chemistry Program to measure thermodynamic                    isotope effects in vapor and liquid phases.  Virial                             coefficients, vapor pressures, condensed phase partial molar                    volumes, compressibilities and expansivities, and the isotope                   effects on these properties will be measured between room                       temperature and the critical temperature, and from less than                    0.1 to 200 MPa.  In a second and complementary project,                         refractive index differences between isotopic isomers, and                      between liquids and solutions will be measured.  The                            theoretical analysis of the results will focus on the relation                  between intermolecular forces in the condensed phase and the                    molecular properties, especially the polarizability, and will                   include consideration of the contributions from isotope effects                 from different normal mode vibrations.                                          %%%                                                                             Systematic and accurate measurement of thermodynamic properties                 is extremely important for the development of theories of                       intermolecular interactions in vapors, liquids, and solutions                   as well as for more practical reasons.  The current research                    program will produce precise data for small differences in                      thermodynamic properties which result from isotopic                             substitution.  This research will also provide some of the most                 accurate thermodynamic data available on the reference                          compounds used.  The data produced will provide a valuable                      resource to the larger community of chemists and chemical                       engineers.",
