 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Rizzo will pursue a new approach for                 measuring the spectroscopy of highly vibrationally excited                      molecules on the ground potential energy surface using a CO2                    laser to selectively dissociate molecules promoted to those                     highly excited levels by means of overtone excitation.  In                      these experiments he will use infrared multiphoton dissociation                 as a detector in infrared-optical and optical-infrared double                   resonance spectroscopy experiments conducted in low-pressure                    static gas cells as well as in supersonic free jets.  These                     investigations are extensions of previous three-laser                           experiments complicated by the addition of the fourth CO2                       photodissociating source.  Specific systems for study consist                   of molecules which have a light-atom stretching vibration                       suitable for overtone excitation and which can be                               photodissociated to produce a fragment that can be probed using                 laser-induced fluorescence.  Examples of such molecules include                 alcohols, amines, cyanides, and halogenated alkanes.                            %%%                                                                             Vibrationally excited molecules are commonly produced in                        chemical reactions or by absorbing light followed by loss of                    some of the excitation energy in internal processes.  Such                      highly excited molecules can be significantly more reactive                     than their unexcited counterparts, so that it is important to                   understand the dynamics involved with such molecules, such as                   how quickly they lose their energy internally, in collisions                    with walls and other species, and how quickly they react.                       Understanding such dynamic processes is important for                           developing accurate models of combustion, atmospheric                           processes, chemical laser action, and chemical vapor                            deposition, which is used to make thin-film coatings.                           Professor Rizzo's studies will help gather information relevant                 to understanding internal energy conversion.",
