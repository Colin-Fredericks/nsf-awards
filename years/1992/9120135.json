Fendler of Syracuse University and Dr.                                 Alexander G. Petrov of the Laboratory of Liquid                                 Crystals and Molecular Electronics of Georgi                                    Nadjakov University, Sofia, will examine                                        flexoelectricity in bilayer lipid membranes.  The                               Bulgarian researchers have found that periodic                                  bending of a bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) results                               in microvolt-range transmembrane potential.  The                                Bulgarians have a theoretical rationalization of                                the phenomenon and have examined it by electrical                               measurements which included the direct                                          determination of Uf and indirect determination of                               c.  The Americans have used optical                                             interferometry to determine ultrasmall,                                         hydrostatic-pressure-induced movements of BLMs.                                 In this proposal, the researchers propose to: (1)                               use real-time stroboscopic interferometric                                      measurements to determine directly c in the                                     periodically bent BLMs; (2) determine                                           simultaneously electrical and optical                                           flexoelectric coefficients of BLMs, to test                                     theories of flexoelectricity; (3) investigate a                                 variety of structurally different BLMs; (4) study                               converse flexoelectric effect (transmembrane                                    voltage-induced membrane curvature) with                                        interferometric holography and optical                                          interferometry; (5) establish a correspondence                                  between the direct flexoelectric effect                                         (curvature-generated membrane polarization) and                                 the converse one on the same BLM preparation; (6)                               investigate changes of the flexoelectric response                               of a photosensitive BLM under illumination to                                   reveal a new phenomenon, photoflexoelectricity;                                 and (7) attempt to observe photoflexoelectric                                   phenomena by applying repetitive laser pulses to                                a pigmented BLM.
