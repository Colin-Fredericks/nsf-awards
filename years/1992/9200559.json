 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory research has contributed greatly to our understanding                of reproductive physiology and how it is regulated by external                  environmental factors such as day length, nutrition, exercise and               interactions with conspecifics.  However, in these studies, each                variable is considered independently and under controlled                       conditions.  This is clearly not the case in the natural habitat                where social and ecological factors are intertwined to influence                behavior and its physiological underpinnings.  To study physiology              under field conditions requires animal capture and blood-drawing                which are expensive and risky procedures that are traumatic for                 both biologists and animals.  To overcome this major obstacle, Dr.              Gudermuth will develop and validate the use of fecal steroid                    analyses to characterize gonadal function in both domestic and wild             canine species.   This non-capture, non-invasive methodology                    provides a means to collect and process vital information                       concerning the reproductive physiology of animals living in their               natural habitat which would not have previously been possible.                  Moreover, this assay will have an enormous impact on field                      research, wildlife conservation and management, and practical                   aspects of veterinary care of dogs.",
