 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is a goal of our proposals to investigate the collisionless                  processes for energy and momentum exchange in plasma via excitation             and absorption of plasma waves.  Two different types of waves are               to be considered: Alfven waves that organize the momentum transfer              between counterstreaming ion populations via pitch angle scattering             of resonant particles and lower hybrid waves that are very                      effective in energy transfer from ion sources of free energy to                 plasma electrons.                                                               For Alfven waves we are planning the solution of two following                  problems:  the excitation of strongly nonlinear Alfven waves in a               form of shocklets by counterstreaming ions, appearing in the solar              wind in the upstream region of planetary and cometary bow-shocks,               and the cosmic ray transport by galactic wind due to coupling                   between these two plasmas caused by Alfven waves.                               For lower hybrid waves, excited by ion beams in a plasma, the                   nonlinear theory is to be contructed describing the saturation of               the lower hybrid instability by nonlinear wave cascading and wave               absorption by plasma electrons and ions.  The most important                    cascade mechanism that is to be under detailed analysis, is the                 modulational instability and collaspe of lower hybrid waves.                    Finally, as the possible example of collective interactions in                  collisional dominated plasma, the formation of the weak                         electrostatic shock inside the cometary ionosphere would be                     considered.",
