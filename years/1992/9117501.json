 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                       under the Hungary Joint Fund between Dr. Denes Berenyi,                         Institute of Nuclear Research of the Hungarian Academy of                       Science, and Dr. John Tanis, Western Michigan University,                       is to investigate fundamental two-electron processes in                         ion-atom collisions.                                                                                                                                            Two-electron processes involving continuum states can play                      an important role in the dynamics of ion-atom collisions,                       and, therefore, provide insight into the few-body problem.                      This project will work to determine the mechanisms                              responsible for continuum-electron emission and to                              evaluate the role which the electron-electron interaction                       plays in giving rise to continuum electrons.  Studies will                      be conducted for several ions colliding with neutral gas                        targets over an energy range from a few keV/u to several                        MeV/u.  Individual processes will be isolated and                               investigated using coincidence techniques in which                              continuum electrons are recorded in coincidence with                            projectile ions emerging from the interaction region in                         specific charge states.                                                                                                                                         This project in nuclear energy fulfills the program                             objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
