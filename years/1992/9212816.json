By the end of the 1920s, however, the              domestic industry was firmly established as a world competitor                  capable of producing such notable products as aspirin, plastics,                and dyestuffs--all of which had come in whole or part from Germany              before the war.                                                                                                                                                 Entering World War I, the United States possessed one of the                    strongest industrial sectors of any nation--with the exception of               synthetic organic chemicals.  The wartime shortages may account for             the initial impetus for the industry's growth, but it fails to                  explain the concrete steps taken to translate the recognized                    deficiency into a viable industry.  The significance of this topic              lies in discovering and analyzing the specific measures taken by                industrialists, policy makers, universities, and others who worked              to establish an industry where virtually none had existed before.                                                                                               Ms. Steen, under the direction of her dissertation adviser, Dr.                 David Hounshell of the Carnegie Mellon University, is traveling to              several archival collections crucial to documenting the process of              development of this critical industry.  Included among the                      collections to be consulted for this research are the Charles H.                Herty papers at Emory University, the Francis P. Garvan papers at               the University of Wyoming, and several corporate records                        depositories.",
