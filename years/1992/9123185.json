T.                                      William Donnelly and Ernest J. Moniz of the                                     Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Drs.                                  Mahir Hussein and Helio Diaz of the University                                  of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The focus of the                                         research will be to carry out collaborative                                     theoretical research nuclear physics,                                           specifically calculations of the nuclear                                        response to high energy electron scattering.                                    The output of such calculations would greatly                                   further the experimental programs at several                                    high priority laboratories in the U.S. and                                      Brazil.                                                                                                                                                         The project will provide calculations of the                                    nuclear response to high energy electron                                        scattering. Electromagnetic nuclear physics is                                  one of the top priority activities in nuclear                                   science and the investigators are amongst the                                   leaders worldwide in performing such                                            calculations.  The investigators will explore                                   the use of overlapping resonances and non-                                      resonant background terms in understanding                                      giant resonance electro-excitation.  They will                                  also probe the microscopic basis for the                                        resonance picture.  In addition, they will                                      investigate the role of two-body interactions                                   when imbedded in a nuclear medium, focussing on                                 the repulsive core part of the nucleon-nucleon                                  interaction and how it introduces short range                                   correlations and modifies the electron                                          scattering response functions.  The                                             calculations will enhance the experimental                                      programs at CEBAF and Bates (high priority                                      laboratories in the U.S.) and for the                                           lower energy facilities under construction in                                   Brazil.",
