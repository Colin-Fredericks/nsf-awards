In particular we intend to test the following hypotheses:             1) Fluid movement is taking place beneath supratidal carbonate mud              islands in Florida Bay in response to the reflux of hypersaline                 fluids formed on the island surfaces; 2) Dolomite is forming in                 response to the movement of these fluids and therefore                          dolomitization is more extensive in islands which have been islands             throughout their entire history than in islands which have formed               more recently; 3) The difference in fluid density amongst the                   various islands is a result of a climatic gradient, the highest                 salinities occurring in the areas of the bay with the lowest                    rainfall.  The magnitude of the reflux is greater in those islands              which show a greater difference in fluid density between the island             and the adjacent bay.                                                                In order to test these hypotheses, we will (i) core between                10 to 20 islands which span the climatic gradient present in                    Florida Bay and which on the basis of previously published work                 have experienced sedimentological different histories, (ii)                     instrument two islands which occur at the ends of this climatic                 gradient with a series of nested piezometers and carry out                      geochemical analyses at regular intervals throughout the wet and                dry seasons.",
