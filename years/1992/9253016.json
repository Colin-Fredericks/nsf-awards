The center                                           consolidates and expands existing polymer and                                   ceramic research capabilities through the                                       development of interdepartmental and                                            interinstitutional research anbd education                                      clusters.  To donduct basic and applied                                         research in high performancepolymers and                                        ceramics in the Center, major equipment and                                     instrumentation are required.  In this                                          proposal we request funds to acquire a thermal                                  analysis system to support research projectrs                                   conducted in the HiPPAC Center.  This                                           instrumentation will provide the HiPPAC Center                                  investigators with the ability to examine th                                    conversion of preceramic materials to ceramic                                   materials, and the characterization of ceramic                                  materials, in addition to the ability to                                        characterize high performance polymers.  The                                    growth in research and education programs in                                    the materials area at CAU. and in particular                                    expansion into the preceramic and ceramic                                       area, necessitates the acquisition of a                                         thermal analysis system- that includes a high                                   temperature TG/DTA and DSC and TMA with                                         programmable temperature conteol for below                                      ambient conditions and higher operating                                         temperatures and is capable of high throughput                                  and state of the art diagnostic capabilities.                                   The research projects that the thermal                                          analysis system will support are part of CAU's                                  strong commitment to enhance its overall                                        development of research capabilities,                                           strengthening minority faculty and student                                      experiences, establishing interinstitutional                                    research alliances with other HBCUs and major                                   research universities, and strengtrhening its                                   undergraduate and graduate science degree                                       programs.",
