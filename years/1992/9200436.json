 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic phytoplankton may act as a sink for carbon dioxide (CO2)                 and a major producer of dimethylsulfide (DMS).  Maximum effects                 are expected in the marginal ice zone where phytoplankton blooms                extend from May to September as the ice recedes northwards.                     These productive waters can cover more than half the area of                    arctic shelf seas, such as the Barents Sea, in any one growth                   period.  One of the main components of the phytoplankton at the                 marginal ice zone is Phaeocystis pouchetii which, in its colonial               form, is a high producer of DMS.  This species is known to                      excrete a high proportion of newly fixed carbon as high molecular               weight polymers in order to form the colony.  Later, it sinks in                mass in the latter stages of the bloom when nitrate becomes                     limiting.  Diatoms, such as Thalassiosira gravida, may dominate                 the bloom at the ice edge late in the summer and may also precede               the P. pouchetii bloom in early spring (i.e. Chaetoceros                        socialis).  The different patterns of dissolved organic carbon                  formation and cell sedimentation between P. pouchetii and diatoms               need to be included in productivity models for an understanding                 of the production and sink of CO2 and DMS in arctic shelf areas.                The objectives of this field and laboratory study, in                           collaboration with Norwegian scientists, are to:  (1) to                        determine the quantitative differences between P. pouchetii and                 diatoms blooms in the ice edge with respect to primary                          production, proportion of carbon fixed that is extracellular, DMS               production, and sedimentation of particulate carbon and sulfur to               depth: (2) to determine which are the main environmental                        variables that favor each type of bloom using a 10-year time                    series from the Barents Sea; and (3) to estimate a 10-year time                 series of DMS production and CO2 uptake by combining the existing               time series with carbon and sulfur budgets of the ice edge                      blooms.  This research will provide a first approximation to the                seasonal and interannual variability of the phytoplankton                       contribution to the carbon and sulfur cycle during the ice edge                 bloom in arctic shelf areas.",
