 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most strategic thinkers are of the opinion that the next world war,             should one occur, will not start with a \"bolt from the blue,\"                   rather, the gravest threat to international stability is usually                taken to be an escalation of some minor incident or conflict to a               major international crisis and, ultimately, to a global                         thermonuclear war.                                                                                                                                              The researchers will study the escalation process by using the                  contemporary methodology of games of incomplete information.  This              methodology allows a more realistic asessment of escalation than                more standard models that assume complete information.  In general,             in complete information games, war never breaks out and escalation              never occurs.  By contrast, the dynamic processes discovered under              incomplete information more closely match those observed in the                 real world.                                                                                                                                                     The proposed modeling effort differs in one very significant way                from other incomplete information models; the players in the games              under study are provided with two distinct ways (other than                     outright capitulation) to resist a challenge.  This, in turn,                   permits the introduction of an intermediate level of interstate                 conflict into the analysis and a more realistic assessment of the               conditions associated with stable deterrence.  By delving into                  these conditions the investigator will gain insight into the                    precise set of circumstances in which sub-strategic deployments                 make limited war possible and total war either more or less likely.                                                                                             For example, by assuming that the players are unsure of each                    other's intentions to wage nuclear war, but that each knows that                the other will (or will not) choose to fight at a sub-strategic                 level, the consequences of adopting a \"Flexible Response\" posture               (or a policy of Massive Retaliation) can be assessed.  Similarly,               by further assuming incomplete information by each player about the             other's willingness to fight both at the sub-strategic and the                  strategic level, the implications of various mixgures of these two              policies can be addressed and the consequences of different \"mixes\"             of conventional and tactical weapons with strategic weapons can be              explored.",
