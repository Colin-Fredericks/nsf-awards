 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study the linear and nonlinear partial               differential equations of structured models of cell population                  dynamics.  The equations model growth and treatment of normal and               tumor cell populations.  The models use age and size as structure               variables to track individual cells through the cell cycle.  The                models involve systems of equations to account for interaction                  between proliferating and quiescent or drug-resistant cell                      subpopulations.  The objective of the research is to obtain                     qualitative information about the behavior of the solutions of                  the equations.  Such behavior includes asynchronous exponential                 growth of early growth stage tumors, quiescence as a mechanism in               Gompertzian type growth in late stage tumors, comparison of                     continuous and periodic treatment, and resonances in phase-                     specific periodic treatment.  The methods of the research use                   spectral theory of linear operators, semigroup theory of linear                 and nonlinear operators in Banach lattices, and nonlinear                       perturbation techniques.                                                             The project uses mathematical modelling and numerical                      simulation to understand essential biological features of cell                  population growth.  Inherent qualitative features of population                 growth processes can be revealed by these mathematical models.                  The complexity of the population processes requires sophisticated               mathematical models incorporating individual cell behavior.  The                significance of this research lies both in the development of                   mathematical methods to analyze structured population models and                in the identification of the qualitative features of these models               that have potential biological applicability.  Results of the                   project may shed light on the behavior of tumors.",
