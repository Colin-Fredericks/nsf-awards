 "awd_abstract_narration": "The absence of central political authorities at the international               level implies that problems of global environmental change can be               resolved only if national governments and other relevant                        organizations find some way to cooperate with each other.                       Researchers on common pool resources (CPRs) and international                   regimes, although working separately and for the most part without              awareness of each other, have identified remarkably similar design              principles underlying successful self-organized cooperative                     solutions to problems of collective action.  In this project, the               investigators will examine the relevance of these same theoretical              principles to global cooperation on environmental change by                     convening a multidisciplinary conference in which prominent                     researchers in the fields of common pool resources and                          international regimes, along with political scientists who have                 worked on global environmental problems, will present papers and                engage in intensive discussion.  The investigators are interested               in environmental protection and environmental change for policy as              well as scientific reasons.  Their analysis may assist                          practitioners in designing more effective institutions to protect               ecological values.  Thus, this project fits well under the Human                Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Initiative.",
