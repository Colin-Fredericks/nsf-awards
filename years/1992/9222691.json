These                      capabilities have yet to be widely applied to materials science                 and engineering, a large, geographically scattered, innately                    multidisciplinary area of national importance.  The Southeastern                Universities Research Association (SURA) request support for a                  workshop to determine ho the materials community could best                     benefit from high speed computer networks.                                                                                                                      Network capabilities and database and conferencing technology                   such as dial-up video service would demonstrated in this tow day                workshop.                                                                                                                                                       This conference will bring together many academic and government                representatives from the numerous materials science and                         engineering constituencies and from the networking technology                   community who are essential for the design, development,                        deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance computer                network.  This effort is in step with federal initiatives in high               performance computing and its plans to meet pressing needs for                  improved research collaboration and productivity in the United                  States.***",
