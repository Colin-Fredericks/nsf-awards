 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Christopher Clark of                              Cornell University and a graduate student to                                    collaborate with two groups of European biologists in                           a study of songbird communication.  Professor Clark                             has developed a passive acoustic system for locating                            vocalizing animals using an array of microphones.  The                          system computes the locations of individual birds                               which are vocalizing anywhere within 200 meters of the                          center of the array.  This technique allows him to                              simultaneously follow the movements and acoustic                                behaviors of many different birds within a community                            and study the details of their vocal interactions.  He                          will apply this system to two well marked and studied                           populations of European birds through field work in                             England with Dr. Peter McGregor of the University of                            Nottingham and in Denmark with Dr. Torben Dabelsteen                            from the University of Copenhagen.  These                                       collaborators have marked populations of blackbirds                             and other species, and have pioneered interactive                               playback systems that are biologically meaningful.                                                                                                              Bird song and singing behavior among territorial birds                          are very complex and poorly understood phenomena.                               This research plan introduces innovative techniques                             that will help surmount technical problems associated                           with studying communication networks.  The results                              should be significant new information about how                                 animals communicate with their vocalizations.",
