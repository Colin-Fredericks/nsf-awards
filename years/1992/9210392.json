 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the interaction of a cellular trans-               cription factor, the protein CREB, and the hepatitis B transacti-               vating factor, the protein px.  Cellular genes are transcribed when             transcription activators react with specific DNA sequences.  When               viruses infect cells, immediate early viral genes are transcribed               in order to obtain expression of other virus-encoded genes.  CREB               is a leucine zipper protein, which also contains a specific DNA-                binding region, px is unable to bind DNA, but the px-CREB protein-              protein complex is able to bind to a variant CRE-like site present              in the viral genome.  The interactions between CREB and px will be              studied using CREB site-directed mutants expressed in and purified              from bacterial systems, and CREB-specific polyclonal antibodies.                The mechanism of recognition of the variant CRE-like site will also             be determined.                                                                  %%%                                                                             In order to have transcription of cellular DNA, proteins called                 transcription factors bind to sequence-specific portions of DNA;                one such protein is called CREB.  When viruses infect cells, some               of their genes are transcribed; one protein product is called px.               When these two proteins interact, the complex can interact with a               viral DNA binding site very similar to the cellular DNA binding                 site, that the two proteins separately cannot interact with.  This              allows synthesis of further viral proteins.  This proposal is to                examine the factors that allow the two proteins to interact, using              mutant CREB proteins and antibodies to CREB.  The mechanism of                  recognition of the viral DNA binding site by the protein complex                will also be determined.",
