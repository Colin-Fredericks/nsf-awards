 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Hands-on Universe\" project creates eight supplemental                      investigations in which students analyze astronomical images                    taken by remote telescopes using charge coupled device                          detectors.  Current and past images will become available                       from the Automated Supernova Search, which takes 500 images                     per clear night.  The analysis is done in the classroom                         using IBM-compatible image processing software developed at                     the University of California/Berkeley for research work.                        The activities, intended for high school astronomy, physics                     or physical science courses, provide hands-on investigations                    coupled with an in-depth experience of engaging in science                      research using powerful technological tools.                                    Telecommunications links students, teachers and                                 professionals in a genuine collaborative and apprenticeship                     style interaction which can lead to original research.  The                     activities, generated by professional astronomers and                           teachers, include investigations of the mass of Jupiter by                      measuring the motion of one of its moons, spatial dimensions                    of the solar system, collaborative searches for varying                         sources, plotting light curves, and distance to distant                         objects.  Materials will include an introductory video,                         student materials, and software for students to conduct                         their own image processing activities.",
