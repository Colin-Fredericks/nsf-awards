 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to apply recently                        developed ideas and techniques from statistical mechanics,                      plasma physics, and, particularly, dynamical systems theory to                  problems involving the evolution of self-gravitating systems                    of objects, both Newtonianly and in general relativity.  One                    general problem to be considered is the \"relaxation\" and                        stability of galaxies and galactic nuclei.  Two principal aims                  here are (a) to understand from first principles the origins                    of the observed similarities amongst galaxies, a nontrivial                     issue in that the nominal relaxation time tR is typically                       orders of magnitude larger than the age of the Universe; and                    related to this, (b) to understand how galaxies respond to                      strong external stimuli, as provided, e.g., by collisions with                  other galaxies, by very rapidly evolving towards a new                          statistical equilibrium.  The other area to be considered                       entails an application of ideas from statistical physics to                     quantum field theory in the early Universe.  Two principal                      aims here are (a) the modeling of phase transitions and other                   quantum field theoretic processes as simple stochastic                          processes and (b) an analysis of particle creation in the                       early Universe, with the ultimate aim of obtaining an improved                  understanding of \"gravitational entropy\" and the observed                       \"arrow of time.\"",
