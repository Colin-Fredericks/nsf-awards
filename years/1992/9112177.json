 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few studies have examined the ecological factors that shape                the social life histories of termites, a taxon important for                    comparison with other cooperatively living animals.  The dampwood               termite, Zootermopsis nevadensis, is a model organism for                       studies on nest-founding, biparental care, foraging and offspring               production.  Much of a colony's nesting and feeding activity, up                to the 2nd year, can be observed on the log's surface, just under               the bark.  These characteristics serve to facilitate studies of                 the ecological pressures influencing Zootermopsis.                                   This study on incipient colonies of Zootermopsis nevadensis                will show how limited nitrogen availability, intraspecific                      competition, and predation influence 1) mate choice and/or                      competition for mates and 2) survivorship of breeding adults,                   territory size and offspring production.  3) The advantages of                  biparental care under various ecological conditions will also be                assessed, by comparing uniparental colonies with biparental                     colonies.  An estimated 900 field colonies will be sampled over a               one year period.  Experimental manipulations that serve to                      increase and decrease potential ecological pressures on colonies,               coupled with information obtained from undisturbed colonies under               assessed ecological conditions, will provide a comprehensive and                quantitative view of the factors hypothesized to be important in                the social life history of Zootermopsis.",
