 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David Oxtoby is supported by a grant from the                         Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical studies of the liquid state.  His research is                       directed toward the fundamental properties that underlie the                    phase transitions between gas, liquid, and crystalline                          states of matter.  Major emphasis is placed on studying the                     dynamics of these state changes, the rates of nucleation and                    the rates of crystal growth.  Oxtoby will employ modern                         statistical mechanics methods which he has developed,                           especially density functional methods, to study these                           problems.  Applications include the condensation of liquids                     from the vapor, the crystallization of colloidal fluids, and                    the rapid solidification of metal alloys.                                       %%%                                                                             Nucleation is a very important physical process which has                       important implications in such diverse areas as atmospheric                     chemistry and metallurgy.  The dynamics of phase changes                        depend critically on the nucleation process.  Professor                         Oxtoby has pioneered the development of a theoretical                           technique known as density functional theory which he is                        using to study gas phase to liquid phase nucleation, and                        liquid phase to solid phase nucleation.",
