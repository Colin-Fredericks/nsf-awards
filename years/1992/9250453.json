 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to complete the development of a                    two course sequence (Semiconductor Device Physics and                           Introduction to Microelectronics) which provide the foundation                  for semiconductor devices by adding a laboratory course which                   emphasizes test and characterization.  Upon completion of the                   present courses, the student has an understanding of the basic                  physics of pn junctions, bipolar transistors, and both junction                 and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors.  This                   new laboratory will provide the student with the tools required                 to characterize and evaluate the performance of these devices.                  This will, in turn, provide the student with the basic test                     skills required to work effectively in industrial organizations                 developing and manufacturing semiconductor devices and                          circuits.                                                                       The current laboratory lacks the capacitance voltage apparatus                  which is essential for the characterization of MOS based                        devices, which dominate present integrated circuit                              technologies.  With the equipment being acquired through this                   project, the development of the semiconductor device physics                    course sequence will be able to be completed.",
