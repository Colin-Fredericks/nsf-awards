 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois State University seeks funds to develop a model                        mathematics program for elementary teachers grades K-6, both                    preservice and inservice, focusing on the cognitive guided                      instruction approach to instruction.  Teams of experienced                      teachers will be selected and prepared in CGI for a year and                    these teachers will establish learning environments in their                    classrooms that reflect current research findings on how                        children learn mathematics.  Subsequently, these teachers and                   new teams will work with preservice teachers in mathematics                     and mathematics education required coursework and school-based                  experiences.  The preservice teachers will be in seminars                       together with the inservice teachers.  These seminars will                      address teaching and learning as related to problem solving                     with understanding in the topic areas of the Curriculum and                     Evaluation Standards  of the National Council of Teachers of                    Mathematics.  The preservice teachers will be studied in the                    research component of the project as they become new teachers                   and are followed by the proposers into their own teaching                       years throughout the duration of the project.  The College of                   Education and the Department of Mathematics are collaborating                   in the implementation of this program together with school                      systems in the area.                                                                                                                                            The contribution of Illinois State University accounts for 22%                  of the NSF budget.",
