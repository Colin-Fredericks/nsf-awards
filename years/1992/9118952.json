 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses primarily on the transcriptional regulation                of the G-protein alpha i2 subunit and potential feedback mechanisms             by which G proteins are themselves regulated.  Transient co-                    transfection assays demonstrate changes in transcription of several             different promoter-reporter genes when introduced into cells with               increasing amounts of plasmids directing the synthesis of specific              G protein subunits.  The combination of this co-transfection assay              with in vitro mutagenesis of alpha i2 promoter regions will aid                 characterization and mapping of regions required for G protein                  dependent responses.  Such studies will permit the association of               new functions with specific G protein subunits and the distinction              between mechanisms affected by closely realted subunits.                                                                                                        GTP-binding (G) proteins are membrane-associated proteins that have             critical roles in regulating cellular responses to a variety of                 external stimuli.  G protein-mediated cascades include the                      generation of cyclic AMP, activation of protein kinase C, and the               regulation of several ion channels.  These pathways impinge upon                other processes that ultimately can affect the functioning of                   transcription factors and the expression of numerous genes,                     including G proteins.  Multiple control mechanisms appear to be                 operative in determining tissue specific aqnd differentiation-                  dependent expression of G proteins.  In addition, analysis of DNA               sequences from some of these genes reveals potential cAMP and                   phorbol ester responsive elements near the transcriptional control              signals.  Knowledge of how G protein pathways interact to influence             transcription will lead to a greater understanding of how signal                transduction mechanisms coordinate gene expression during cell                  growth and development.",
