 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the synthesis and metal                             complexation of cyclopentadienyl anologs, e.g. 1,2,4-TECp                       (1,2,4-triethano bridged bis(cyclopentadienide)),                               ofcyclophanes.  Transition metal complexation of the exo                        pi-faces of 1,2,4-TECp and analogous compounds will lead to                     dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric metallocene containing                        materials.  These polymeric columnar metallocenes are                           electronically linked via powerful interannular through-space                   electronic interactions and are expected to show novel electron                 transfer properties.                                                            %%%                                                                             With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                    the research of Dr. Mark L. McLaughlin of the Department of                     Chemistry at Louisiana State University.  Professor McLaughlin                  will focus his work on the synthesis of cyclopentadienophanes,                  compounds having two five-membered rings of carbon atoms                        containing two double bonds, with the two rings joined by three                 side-chains which hold the two rings rigidly near and parallel                  to one another.  Above and below each ring sits a                               doughnut-shaped electron cloud, and a powerful interaction                      between the clouds of the two rings exists because of their                     close proximity. These compounds will bind to transition metals                 to form columnar structures, and the transition metal complexes                 are likely to exhibit facile electron transfer, and perhaps                     also interesting materials properties.",
