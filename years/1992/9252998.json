 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employer's growing dependence on women and the                            changing demographics of the labor force have pushed gender                     issues to the forefront of workplace reforms.  This project asks                about the conditions that prompt some corporations to institute                 policies and programs to help women meet their family obligations               and succeed at their jobs.  The research design includes a survey               of 1,000 major corporations regarding policies and programs for                 women and an on-site case study of one corporation with a                       reputation for supporting women.  The survey of corporations                    asks about global predictors of responsiveness to women, and the                case study inquires about the dynamics of gender relations                      relative to corporate structures, culture, and practices.  Guided by            new structuralism/devaluation theory and theories of gender (that               focus on the institutional and processual aspects of gender), the               investigator asks:  (1) what kinds of corporations are helping                  women?  (2) what strategies are they using?  (3) how effective are              these strategies and for whom?                                                        The identification of conditions and practices that help                  women meet their job and family obligations gives practical and                 policy-relevant import to this research.                                              The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    bringing women scientists to campus to discuss their research on                sex/gender and science, and on gender, work and family;                         teaching; mentoring, and counseling.",
