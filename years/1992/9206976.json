 "awd_abstract_narration": "The substitution method was suggested by Hilbert (1930) as a               successive approximation method for finding finite function                     solutions of a system of number-theoretic functional equations,                 which are derived from proofs in formal systems.  Convergence, i.e.             termination of this method produces finitistic proofs of                        combinatorial identities and numerical realizations of provable                 Sigma-zero-one-formulas.  The problem of convergence was treated by             von Neumann (1927) for quantifier-free induction and by Ackermann               (1940) for the system of first-order arithmetic.  The problem for               analysis remained open until very recently, when it was settled by              Mints (1990).  Mints now intends to investigate convergence                     problems for other systems where the problem is still open,                     including the following:  1) predicative analysis and predicatively             reducible systems, 2) stronger subsystems of analysis whose proof-              theoretic ordinal is known, 3) the theory of types, 4) full                     analysis with the axiom of choice, 5) Zermelo set theory and                    possibly stronger systems.                                                           Proof theory examines questions about proofs that lie to one               side of their correctness.  Correctness is understood and taken for             granted.  For example, what axioms are required, all the axioms of              a system or only a proper subset?  Indeed, certain axioms are                   particularly critical in such studies, the necessity of employing               the so-called Axiom of Choice, involving orders of infinity greater             than that of the set of all the positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ...,                being considered particularly interesting.  Other strong axioms of              infinity often play this role too.  In another direction, one can               ask of a proof that shows that something or other exists whether it             provides an explicit recipe for constructing the thing shown to                 exist.  Proofs which do are called \"constructive,\" and others,                  \"non-constructive.\"  A particularly intriguing part of proof theory             concerns itself with whether a non-constructive proof can be                    reworked in some automatic way into a constructive one.  It turns               out that the answer depends on the theory being studied.  The                   investigator has shown that a method known as the Hilbert                       substitution method can be used to turn any non-constructive proof              in a certain formulation of analysis into a constructive one by                 essentially turning a crank, and he would like to know if the                   argument he gave can be adapted to obtain the analogous result for              certain other mathematical systems.",
