 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to observe solar electric fields.  Solar plasma                electric fields have received relatively little attention                       considering the central importance of such fields in energy                     release, and in plasma and energetic particle acceleration in the               solar atmosphere.  This proposal is to carry out ground-based                   measurements of such fields to validate the promising                           \"electrograph\" technique of electric field remote sensing.  This                is based on measurement of the transverse Stark effect in solar                 hydrogen lines.  The PI plans to upgrade the SPO instrument to                  increase its sensitivity to 1 volt cm1, and test this sensitivity               by observing the motional electric field (due to random cross-B                 particle motions in any magnetized plasma) which should become                  detectable in the sunspot chromosphere at this sensitivity level.               More broadly, they plan to operate the electrograph on a daily                  basis to study the intensity, geometry, and spatial and time                    behavior of electric fields associated with flares, eruptive                    filaments, sunspots and faculae.  They also plan to extend the                  electrograph technique farther into the infrared, to include                    promising hydrogen lines out to beyond 10 .  This IR work will be               carried out with the FTS and with the main McMath spectrograph at               Kitt Peak.  The results of thes investigations will be compared                 to the discharge and reconnection models of flares, to models of                post-flare loops, filament eruptions, and also to recent ideas on               solar abundance variations.  They experience in these ground-                   based observations will be also used to determine the optimum                   wavelengths of electrograph operation in the infrared, and to                   investigate whether important advantages in electric field                      measurements on the disc and at the limb might be achieved with                 an electrograph flown on a balloon, on the Shuttle or on a                      satellite.",
