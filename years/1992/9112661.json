 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research enables a biologist and a philosopher to examine                  two ethical issues related to science.  On the abstract level,                  they will consider what ethical principles are relevant to                      ecologists' interpretations of uncertain scientific results that                might have consequences for environmental policy.  Concretely,                  they will consider how ecologists should apply these principles                 to a current problem in policy, preservation of the unique and                  rare Florida scrub habitat.  The investigators begin having                     completed an analysis of normative assumptions involved in                      ecological concepts and conclusions.  In this project, they will                consider how conflicts between ethical principles can be                        resolved, by developing second-order principles and examining                   alternative, plausible consequences from their use.  They will                  test their results from this procedure by examining the case of                 the preservation of the Florida scrub habitat.  Because the case                is environmentally significant but biologically uncertain, the                  ethical constraints on how to interpret research relevant to its                preservation are likely to be applicable in many situations of                  environmental ethics and public policy.  The research has three                 objectives:  to examine the ethical obligations of ecologists in                interpreting and disseminating their results; to identify the                   normative assumptions in alternative positions on how ecologists                ought to interpret their results in problematic cases; and to                   assess the consequences, in a specific case, of taking particular               stands on interpretation and dissemination.  The results should                 illuminate public and professional debates about ethical                        standards for science and scientific obligations to the public.",
