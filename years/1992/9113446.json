 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal focus of this research program is the synthesis                   and study of previously unknown cyclic, polycyclic and                          polymeric organic compounds in which multiple acetylenic units                  can communicate electronically with one another, either through                 space (homoconjugatively) or via intervening heteroatoms or                     cyclopropanes. Specifically, the acetylenic-containing                          synthetic targets are the first phosphocarbon cage molecules,                   the first thiocarbon rings, tri-element cage molecules (C,P,S),                 thiocarbon polymers, 4- and 5-sided spirocyclopropyl                            homoconjugated cyclic polydiynes, the 5-sided spirocyclopropyl                  homoconjugated cyclic polyacetylene with only one alkyne unit                   per side and a C(60)H(36) cage molecule. Such compounds should                  display a variety of unusual electronic properties which will                   be studied along with other structural features.                                                                                                                %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. Lawrence T. Scott of                  the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada - Reno.                 The unknown cyclic organic compounds which will be synthesized                  should display a variety of unusual electronic properties. An                   understanding of the structural requirements for electron                       delocalization in carefully designed molecules of this sort and                 the consequences thereof should prove valuable in the rational                  design of new organic materials capable of conducting and/or                    storing electricity.",
