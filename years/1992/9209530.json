 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will integrate biophysical, biochemical,                          cellular, physiological and genetic studies on plasmodesmata (pd)               to establish an appropriate framework that will then allow an                   investigation of the cellular processes by which the plant                      regulates its cell-to-cell communication system.  Biophysical                   studies will be performed on a simple cellular system in order to               determine the unitary pd conductance.  Such measurements are                    essential for a further sub-structural analysis of the pd, as well              as to provide a rigorous foundation for detailed studies on the                 cellular controls that orchestrate cell-to-cell size exclusion                  limits.  Physiological studies on the role of pd in solute fluxes               will also be performed.  Since pd are likely to be an important                 determinant of organ development, an experimental system will be                established that will permit identification of the processes that               control secondary pd formation.  In this ongoing collaboration                  (between Beachy and Dr. William Lucas of the University of                      California, Davis), it has been established that transgenic tobacco             plants in which the 30 kDa movement protein (MP) of TMV is                      expressed have pd whose size exclusion limits are up-regulated to               sizes in excess of 9.4 kDa.  The mode by which the 30 kDa TMV-MP                effects this change will be further explored.  It is hypothesized               that this protein interacts directly with the plasmodesma.  Based               on this concept, biochemical isolation and purification of pd                   proteins are proposed.  A genetic system in Arabidopsis will be                 developed to permit the identification and isolation of genes                   involved in virus movement and pd function.                                     %%%                                                                             Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels between individual plant                 cells.  Intercellular communication by passage of molecules through             these channels is critical for the normal development and                       physiological function of the entire plant.  In certain plant viral             infections, the virus gains access to the cell interior at a                    localized site and passes from cell to cell through the                         plasmodesmata throughout the plant.  Passage of the virus through               plasmodesmata is facilitated by a virally encoded protein which                 effectively enlarges the plasmodesmatal channel.  This research                 will take advantage of the viral protein to identify and study the              components of the plant plasmodesmata.  Knowledge of the components             of plasmodesmata will facilitate further studies of the formation               of plasmodesmata and the mechanisms by which molecular traffic                  through the plasmodesmata is regulated.  The results of this                    research will be important contributions to basic knowledge of cell             to cell communication in plants.",
