 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kieve Science Camp for Girls is a one-week residential                    experience for 60 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders from three                   rural and poor Maine communities.  Building on research and                     the expertise of Kieve Science Camp instructors and the Kieve                   Leadership Decisions Institute, this program is designed to                     tackle issues known to stifle the confidence and enthusiasm of                  girls in science.  All activities will be hands-on.  Kieve                      recognizes the importance of informal education:  asking                        questions, exploring, designing, testing, trying again, and                     reaching decisions based on direct application and evidence                     will be the daily bread at camp.  Group problem-solving                         challenges, requiring collaboration, and risk-taking, often a                   new skill for girls, will be encouraged throughout the program                  and on the ropes and adventure course.  An important goal is                    a positive attitudinal shift:  girls should think science is                    fun, important in their lives, and that they can be full                        participants in the scientific world which they inhabit.  The                   carefully selected female instructors and staff address the                     importance of role models.  The inclusion of two teachers from                  each home school will sustain the successes of the Kieve                        experience and further spread the Kieve educational                             methodology.  Project staff will document and evaluate this                     program for the purpose of replication.",
