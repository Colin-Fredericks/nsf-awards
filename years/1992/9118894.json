 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dormant life-history stages of many organisms, including               most terrestrial plants, many terrestrial and freshwater                        invertebrate animals, and even a few vertebrates, represent a                   storage of species and genetic diversity.  When environments                    change through time, these resistent stages (typically though not               always seeds and eggs) prevent extinction of those types of                     organisms that could not withstand the change in their active                   states.  This research explores a series of questions about how                 dormant stages affect survival and maintenance of variation in                  the presence of a changing environment.  The work combines                      development of new mathematical theory with the use of a species                of lake-inhabiting crustacean copepods (ca. 1 mm long) as a model               system.  It is one for which considerable information is already                known.  Four major questions will be addressed:  (1) What is the                environmental and physiological basis for the long-term dormancy,               (2) Does a temporally-fluctuating environment combined with long-               term dormancy provide a mechanism for maintaining greater                       variation than would otherwise occur, (3) How do sediment                       processes (mixing, settling, mortality of dormant stages) affect                the distribution of variable stages, and (4) Can observations                   already made on the copepod population in question be explained                 through an understanding of storage of dormant stages?  The                     research involves a combination of field sampling of lake                       sediments, rearing of copepods in the laboratory, and a careful                 matching of mathematical theory with known processes.  Theory                   will be generalized after its application to the copepod system                 is established.                                                                      Current predictions are for climates to become both drier in               the northeastern US and to become more variable.  Understanding                 how species with dormant stages are likely to respond to these                  changes will help guide predictions of changes in plant and                     animal abundance and distribution.",
