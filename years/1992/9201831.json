 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combined numerical and experimental research program will                be developed to study the hot rolling process with emphasis on the              understanding of the thermomechanical behavior and its associated               microstructure development.  In the numerical approach, macro-heat              transfer and mechanical models will be integrated into a                        metallurgical- or micro-model to simulate the process considered.               With this integrated model, the relationship between the process                parameters and microstructure of the workpiece can be established.              In the experimental approach, the thermomechanical characteristics              of the rolling process will be simulated by a hot deformation                   tester.  The temperature and time dependent changes of                          microstructure during and after deformation will be examined.  The              testing data will be utilized to determine the flow behavior for                macro-modeling and the material parameters needed in the micro-                 modeling.  The kinetic theories associated with statistical                     techniques will be adopted to form the governing equations for the              researched micro-models.  As a result, the needed boundary                      conditions for solving these equations will be provided by the                  experimental data.  The experimental study will also be used to                 verify the modeling predictions to further refine the micro- and                macro-models developed.  Then the strategy to have better control               of the microstructure and mechanical properties can be developed.               Further understanding of the thermomechanical and metallurgical                 phenomena should certainly make for operating the process more                  effectively cost-wise.  The research may also serve as a catalyst               to the development of a new rolling technology for new                          applications.                                                                        The study may allow the production of steel shapes of improved             quality at higher speeds.",
