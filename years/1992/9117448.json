 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an observational study of the formation, evolution,             and dissipation of mesoscale cyclones along the coastline of the                antarctic continent, specifically in conjunction with intense and               persistent katabatic winds.                                                                                                                                     It has been known for some time that the higher southern hemisphere             latitudes are regions of decay for synoptic scale cyclones.  It has             however only recently been found that smaller mesoscale cyclones                can frequently occur over the sea ice and the adjacent coastal                  areas of Antarctica, and significantly affect the coastal climate                                                                                               This study will include both climatological and dynamical aspects               of mesoscale cyclones and will be based on observations by the                  array of automatic weather stations in the Terra Nova Bay region,               and the digital satellite data recorded at McMurdo Station.                     Specific tasks to be undertaken include the study of the dynamics               relating to the genesis of mesoscale cyclones, numerical modeling               of these dynamics, and a comprehensive satellite survey of                      mesoscale cyclogenesis over West Antarctica to define the                       contribution of synoptic forcing.                                                                                                                               The project should improve our understanding of antarctic climate               dynamics, particularly the interactions between the synoptic and                the mesoscale, and should identify whether these cyclones in                    conjunction with synoptic forcing contribute significantly to the               West Antarctic snowfall.",
