 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award addresses the need for improving system reliability  through better software development methods and tools, and  specifically, through applying formal methods to the development of  realtime systems.  The solution sought is a formal framework for  the specification and analysis of realtime systems.  This framework is  based on the ASTRAL formal specification language and includes the  ASTRAL language for writing requirements and design specifications of  realtime systems, a formal proof theory for proving properties about  ASTRAL specifications, and a support environment for the construction  and analysis of the specifications.  The tools that make up the  support environment are a syntax-directed editor, an ASTRAL to TRIO  translator, an ASTRAL specification processor, and a mechanical  theorem prover.  The TRIO-based model checkers, developed at the  Politecnico di Milano, are being integrated into the support  environment.  The main theoretical issues to be investigated deal with the  composability of ASTRAL specifications.  The research is developing a  proof theory that prescribes how the proofs of the individual state  machine specifications can be combined to produce a proof of the  entire system.  Another composability issue to be investigated is the  composition of two or more ASTRAL system specifications (i.e., a  global specification and its associated collection of state machine  specifications) to derive the specification for the composite system.   ASTRAL is being used to specify complex realtime systems  taken from a variety of application areas to evaluate its effectiveness and utility.",
