Interaction between Israeli and American computer                    scientists has always been very fruitful.  At the same time, it has             always been quite imbalanced-quite a few Israeli researchers travel to          the US, but only a small number of American researchers visit Israel.           As a result, many of the Israeli universities faculty members,                  students, and researchers in industrial research organizations have             only limited opportunities to interact with their American colleagues,          leaving room for improvement.  A major inhibitor for closer                     interaction  is the travel expenses.  It is the objective of this               proposal to  provide partial support for American researchers who are           interested in attending.",
