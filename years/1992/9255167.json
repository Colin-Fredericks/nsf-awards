 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) program is                    designed to complement SUNY/College at Old Westbury's college life              science oriented programs, Minority Biomedical Research Support                 (MBRS), Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and Minority                 Institute of Research Development Programs (MIRDP), by providing                comprehensive research and academic enrichment opportunities                    directed towards physical science, mathematics and engineering                  (SEM) fields.  The College at Old Westbury is particularly suited               for this RCMS program because it has one of the highest percentages             of minority students in al the SUNY institutions, and has emerged               as a first-rate institution for undergraduate research in the                   biomedical sciences.  Through its Science Training and Education                Program, and educational pipeline from secondary school to college              has been established.                                                                                                                                           This three year proposal will provide thirty five student with (1)              a residential summer program for talented entering freshman to gain             and early debut into college (2) special academic and career                    faculty mentoring; (3) summer internship in nearby industries such              as Grumman Aerospace, H2M laboratories and Knogo Corporation; and               (4) pre-internship training program preparing students for this                 industrial experience; (5) research opportunities with faculty                  mentors in chemistry, applied mathematics and computer science.                                                                                                 By concentrating on NSF-supported areas of SEM, the RCMS Program                will complete the science education for minority students at the                college.",
