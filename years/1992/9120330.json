 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expert systems that perform diagnosis are being used increasingly             in medicine, aerospace,  and other high-stakes domains.  Research               has recently shown that heuristic schemes widely used in such                   systems to encode uncertain knowledge - used in diagnosis and                   decision making - can produce faulty reasoning.  Schemes based on               probability and decision analysis have been proposed as sounder;                however, they have often then been dismissed as intractable. The                goal of this research is to develop and evaluate new probabilistic              and decision-analytic schemes, that are both sound and tractable.               The planned products comprise methods for encoding uncertain                    knowledge in probabilistic form; for encoding judgments on values,              costs, and preferences; efficient algorithms for probabilistic                  inference and decision making; and methods to generate                          comprehensible explanations of systems conclusions. These                       techniques are demonstrated and evaluated by application to two                 large knowledge-based systems, including a reformulation of QMR                 (Quick Medical Reference), a system for diagnosis in internal                   medicine; and a system for fault diagnosis and repair of gas                    turbines for power generation.  These techniques are expected to                lead to diagnostic expert systems that are easier to build and                  modify, that are more reliable, and that generate diagnostic test               strategies that minimize unnecessary and expensive testing.",
