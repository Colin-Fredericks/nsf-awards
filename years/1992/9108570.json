 "awd_abstract_narration": "Femtosecond lasers and optical techniques have been                             used with great success to study a variety of ultrafast                         processes in optical materials.  Most of these                                  experiments are, however, performed with the                                    Rhodamine 6G dye laser around 630 nm in the                                     visible.  There is a clear need to extend the                                   femtosecond sources to the uv and to the ir and to                              achieve wide tunability.                                                                                                                                        We have recently succeeded in demonstrating for the                             first time a cw uv femtosecond source at 315 nm and                             the first broadly tunable femtosecond optical                                   parametric oscillator (OPO) in the deep red to near                             ir.  The OPO is potentially continuously tunable from                           720 nm to 4.5 uM.  Although our initial experiments                             have demonstrated the spectacular potentials of these                           devices, much work remains to realize these                                     potentials.  A program of research to develop,                                  characterize, and optimize femtosescond sources in                              the uv and broadly tunable optical parametric                                   oscillators in the ir pumped by solid state laser                               sources is outlined.  In addition, we propose to apply                          these unique sources to study the relaxation dynamics                           of nonequilibrium electrons and holes in GaAs and                               related compounds and quantum well structures.",
