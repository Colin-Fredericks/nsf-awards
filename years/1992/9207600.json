 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal are to test the evolutionary               relationships among selected species of the genus Etheostoma and to             test the monophyly of this genus relative to its closest relatives,             Percina and Crystallaria.  These genera comprise the second largest             group of North American freshwater fishes and the majority of                   species in the family Percidae.  Etheostoma is the largest genus                (114 species compared to 34 species of Percina and one species of               Crystallaria).  However, the monophyly of the genus is not well                 established and numerous problems exist concerning the                          relationships among the 18 subgenera.  Polymerase chain reaction                and direct sequencing protocols will be used to amplify and                     sequence parts of the 12S ribosomal gene (800 base pairs) and a                 segment of the cytochrome-b genes (450 base pairs) of 15 species of             Etheostoma, four species of Percina, and two outgroups,                         Crystallaria asprella, and Stizostedion canadense.  This will                   allow me to perform a preliminary test of the monophyly of                      Etheostoma, explore the possibility that some Etheostoma are                    actually more closely related to Percina, and arrive at some                    preliminary conclusions regarding the relationships among selected              species groups of Etheostoma.  Phylogenetic analysis employing                  several parsimony criteria will be used to test alternate                       hypotheses of relationship.  Resolution of the relationships                    among darters will lead to a better understanding of the origin and             diversification of the North American freshwater fish fauna and                 enhance our ability to study the speciation, historical ecology,                and comparative behavior of this speciose group.",
