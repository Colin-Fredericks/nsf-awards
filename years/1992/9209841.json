 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the spontaneous deletion mutant                  which occurs in the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, and results              in loss of the ability of the bacterium to accumulate hemin or                  Congo red and form dark, pigmented colonies.  The deletion involves             at least 40 kilobase pairs of chromosomal DNA.  The size of the in              the mutant will be determined.  Several mutants are available; this             will be constructed with deleted DNA end fragments from the mutant              bacteria, and used to transform wild-type cells to examine the                  involvement of the end fragments in generating the deletion.  The               mechanism of deletion will studied using the reporter gene                      construct.                                                                      %%%                                                                             The plague bacterium and several other pathogenic bacteria undergo              spontaneous deletion of large portions of chromosomal DNA.  The                 plague bacterial mutants are detected by loss of the ability to                 form dark-pigmented colonies.  Several mutants are available; DNA               sequences will be determined to see whether the site of excision is             same in all the mutants.  The DNA fragments representing the site               of cleavage will be added to a reporter gene to be added to wild-               type cells, to see whether the mechanism can be more clearly                    understood.",
