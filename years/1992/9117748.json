 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xanthan gum (xanthan) is an exopolysaccharide that is produced by               the gram-negative pseudomonad, Xanthomonas campestris.  Xanthan is              composed of repeating penta-saccharide subunits that are                        polymerized through B-1-4 linkages between  adjacent glucose                    residues to create a polymer with a glucose backbone, having the                same structure as cellulose; alternate glucose molecules contain                trisaccharide side-chains composed of one molecule of glucuronate               plus two molecules of mannose substituted with an acetyl or                     pyruvate group.  This project will study xanthan production in                  X.campestris as a model system to obtain an understanding of the                genetics and biochemistry that determine the ability of bacteria to             synthesize and export exopolysaccharides.  The study of xanthan                 production is important for two reasons:  the ability of bacteria               to colonize hosts is often associated with polysaccharide                       production; thus investigations into the production of                          polysaccharides should contribute significant new knowledge about               bacterial-host relationships.  Also, these studies of xanthan                   biosynthesis will contribute to our understanding of macromolecules             cross the molecularly complex cellular envelope.  A cluster of 12               gum genes codes for proteins that function in the assembly and                  polymerization of the xanthan repeat units.  The expression of this             gum gene cluster will be delineated, and the presence of                        additional, as yet, undiscovered gum genes that function in the                 cellular export of xanthan will be investigated.  A collection lacZ             and phoA fusions to each of the clustered gum genes will be                     isolated using a combination of in vivo and in vitro procedures.                These fusions will be used to: (i) characterized the cellular                   location of the gum proteins, (ii) determine the level of in vivo               expression of each gum gene, and (iii) define the transcriptional               director gum transcripton unit.  The region of DNA that contains                the gum cluster promoter will be fused to lacZ; the effect of                   deletion and spontaneous \"leaky\" mutations on the expression of                 lacZ will be used to clearly define and characterized the gum                   promoter.  Gene products that are needed to export xanthan from the             cell are virtually certain to be envelope proteins.  Since alkaline             phosphatase (product of phoA) activity is restricted to the                     periplasm, putative export mutants will be isolated as TnphoA                   insertions that are Gum-PhoA+.  These mutants will be characterized             to begin to define the genes involved in the export process.",
