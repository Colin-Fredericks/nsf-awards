 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an Industry-University Collaborative Research project,                  between the Ohio State University (P.I. L.-S. Fan) and Amoco                    Oil Co. (Dr. D. Arters) in the area of high-pressure high-                      temperature three-phase fluidization.  The experiments in                       university will be conducted on a small apparatus.  Pilot                       scale experiments will be performed at Amoco to examine the                     scale effects.  It is proposed to visualize the three-phase                     flow microstructure and study the pressure and temperature                      effects in Newtonian and non-Newtonian systems, in two- and                     three-dimensional fluidized columns.  Bubble dynamics,                          including bubble coalescence and breakage, will be an area of                   focus.  Particle image velocimetry will be used in a mixture                    of fluid and solids with the same refractive index.  The                        effect of pressure on the bubble wake, as well as other                         microstructural aspects of three-phase flow will be                             investigated for the first time.                                                                                                                                If successful, the proposed research on three-phase                             fluidization at high pressure and temperature will extend the                   current limits of application of this approach in chemical                      synthesis, energy production and biotechnology.",
