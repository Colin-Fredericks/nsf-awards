 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-processor platform will be used for the development                of an insitu intelligent materials processing system.  This system              includes data acquisition, analysis and control of advanced                     material processing that can be conducted in real-time as the                   process is running.  This equipment will be dedicated to support                research in advancing several material processing problems                      including:  (1) composition and structure control for laminated                 coatings, (2) real-time control for chemical vapor deposition                   processing, and (3) automated inspection of coatings.  All these                projects take a multi-disciplinary approach in developing a                     fundamental understanding and control of the principal phenomena                of manufacturing and structure/property correlations which would                assist in the engineering and development of new and novel                      materials capabilities.                                                              There is an urgent need in all segments of technology and                  industry for new and advanced materials.  Custom tailoring of                   materials provides exciting new capabilities for all applications               from advanced electronic devices to new structural materials.  A                major barrier to wide-spread use of this approach has been the                  difficulties in utilizing all the data and processing information               needed to design and fabricate these materials.  An intelligent                 materials processing capability will significantly aid the                      materials engineer in achieving these objectives.",
