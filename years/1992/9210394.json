 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intact nerve supply is known to be important to the development and             maintenance of muscle.  However, the mechanisms underlying nerve-               muscle interactions are poorly understood.  To examine this issue,              a unique case of muscle atrophy following damage to a remote nerve              will be studied in a simple, insect system.  In the grasshopper,                loss of a hind leg by autotomy results in atrophy of undamaged,                 fully innervated muscles in the thorax.  Experimental cutting  of               nerves and loading or unloading of these muscles indicates that                 severing the leg nerve during autotomy trans-synaptically induces               atrophy of the undamaged thoracic muscles.  Staining with                       antibodies and intracellular recordings from muscles and identified             neurons will elucidate cellular changes that precede and accompany              atrophy.  Selective ablations of sensory neurons will examine the               role of orthograde influences in the induction of atrophy.                      Selective axotomy of leg muscle motoneurons will examine the role               of retrograde influences.  Selective nerve blockade with                        tetrodotoxin will test the role of neural impulse activity.                     Blockade with colchicine will test the role of molecules                        transported by fast axonal transport maintaining.  These studies                will advance our understanding of the regulatory interactions among             neurons and muscle cells that are crucial for the development and               maintenance of their mature form and function.",
