 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research on the                        existence and smoothness of solutions of overdetermined systems                 of first-order partial differential equations, both linear and                  nonlinear.  It is striking that, in contrast to ordinary                        differential equations, there are simple linear partial                         differential equations possessing no solution.  The analysis of                 this, and related basic questions, lies at the heart of this                    research.  The work, phrased in terms of transformed equations                  known as pseudodifferential operators, seeks to obtain                          information about local solvability of systems of equations.                    Related work is going forward on the microlocal solvability of                  first order nonlinear equations through study of the                            singularities of the equations known as the analytic wave-front                 set.  What has been discovered so far is that the singularities                 propagate exactly as in the linear case. A new line of                          investigation has also begun.  This considers studies of systems                of complex vector fields on a manifold.  It mixes classical ideas               of differential operators with cohomology theory on the manifold                which can be used to define generalized characteristic classes.                 The first objective will be to examine the implications of the                  nonvanishing of those classes.  Also to be considered are the                   geometrical properties absence of due to this nonvanishing.                          Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
