 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted in theoretical condensed matter physics              and materials research covering the fields of semiconductors,                   transition metals, surfaces and interfaces, superlattices, defects,             superconductivity, materials under pressures, clusters and many-                body effects in solids.  The major objective is to explain and                  predict the properties of real materials at the microscopic level               from first principles.  Several different approaches are employed.              Structural and bonding properties are obtained using ab initio                  pseudopotential density functional formalism; excited-state                     properties are calculated using a quasiparticle self-energy                     approach; ground state properties of correlated electronic systems              are studied using a quantum Monte Carlo approach.  A host of solid              state properties are obtained with these methods.  Among these are:             structural information, phase stability, optical and photoemission              spectra, charge density distributions, surface and interface                    characteristics, vibrational and mechanical properties, electron-               phonon interaction parameters, magnetic properties, superconducting             transition temperature, and a variety of other solid state                      phenomena.  Some specific new directions are planned in the areas               of solids with novel structures at high pressures, superhard                    materials, excitation spectra in solids, electron correlations in               two-and three-dimensional systems, superconductivity in                         conventional, high temperature and \"buckeyball\" solids, metal and               semiconductor clusters, solid hydrogen at megabar pressures, and                semiconductor surfaces, interfaces and superlattices.                           %%%                                                                             A broad theoretical and computational program will study the                    electronic structure and properties associated with materials and               condensed matter systems under a variety of conditions and in                   different states.  This group is one of the world leaders in this               area of materials research.",
