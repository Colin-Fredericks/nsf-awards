 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses unsolved problems in software                      portability.  Portability of a software unit (application program or            component) is its ability to be transported and adapted to a new                hardware/software environment at a cost significantly less than                 complete redevelopment.  As far as possible, portable software should           also take advantage of the specific capabilities of the target                  environment.  The continuing proliferation of both applications and             environments has made portability an increasingly critical need which,          in many cases, is largely unfulfilled.                                               The goal is to develop and validate new methods to improve                 portability of software units during the design process, and to                 improve support for portability in computing environments.  These               methods will improve portability for conventional software, and extend          portability to new software classes such as real-time and concurrent            software.  Part of our work is to explore relationships between                 portability and reusability.  Another important part of our study is            the investigation of methods to specify and measure portability                 requirements and attributes.  The research will use both analytical             and experimental methods.  Planned activities include a survey of               existing strategies and methods; analysis of portability problems for           selected new classes of software; development of methods to specify             portability requirements and attributes, and metrics to quantify the            costs and benefits of portability; comparison of potential strategies           for specific classes of software using these specifications and                 metrics; and evaluation of promising strategies by selected                     experimental implementations.",
