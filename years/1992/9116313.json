 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new techniques in molecular biology has opened               many new channels for investigating anthropological questions.  Key             among these new techniques is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)               which allows the quantitative amplification of exceptionally small              quantities of DNA.  This has led to the generation of DNA samples               from ancient soft tissues and bone.  However, one unresolved                    problem derives from the sensitivity of PCR; contamination with                 modern DNA can confound the results.                                                                                                                            This Exploratory Grant for Anthropological Research will allow the              conduct of several well controlled experiments to test                          decontamination procedures.  The PI will artificially contaminate               forensic samples with genetically engineered DNA.  After using                  various protocols the PCR amplified DNA can be compared to expected             results for precise determination of the efficiency of                          decontamination.                                                                                                                                                In addition, though techniques for isolating DNA from bone have                 been published, there are no protocols specific to teeth.  The                  research also will optimize the conditions for isolating DNA from               teeth.  As teeth are the hardest part of the body and the most                  likely to be preserved this technique will have potential uses in               forensic and evolutionary applications.",
