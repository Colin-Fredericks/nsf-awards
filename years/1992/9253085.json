 "awd_abstract_narration": "In their study of design, engineering students often work                       without a context.  As a consequence, they may fail to                          understand the social, historical, economic, and other                          implications associated with the design and manufacture of                      products.  Also, students often design in an environment                        that is insular and hardly imitative of the team development                    characteristic of engineering in American industry.  This                       project will investigate some of the potential benefits to                      collaborative learning and a concurrent design environment                      when the powerful communication tools of high-bandwidth                         networking and digital hypermedia are joined.  A high-                          bandwidth network connecting digital hypermedia databases                       will enable both engineering design operations and                              information to be exchanged concurrently among users at                         several remote sites.  Research and development of this                         proposed distributed multimedia environments, should enable                     students to learn new ways of working with and using                            technology and hypermedia tools in order to collaborate more                    effectively.  The objectives of this study are as follows:                                                                                                      1.   to examine the characteristics inherent in a hypermedia                         distributed environment (non-linearity, annotations,                            multiple representations) as a communication medium                             which supports collaborative design between distant                             geographic locations;                                                                                                                                      2.   to modify and develop communication tools and resources                         of collaborative design for use in a distributed                                hypermedia environments;                                                                                                                                   3.   to analyze communication activities of students in a                            collaborative design environment in order to promote                            the teaching of collaboration skills needed for                                 concurrent engineering design; and                                                                                                                         4.   to introduce computer-assisted cooperative work models                          into the engineering curriculum.",
