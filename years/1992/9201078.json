 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses combinatorial and algorithmic problems related          to searching and matching of strings.  The main emphasis of the research        is on problems that are recurrent in the vast and growing domain of             molecular sequence analysis, but the results of this study would benefit        various other fields.  Specific issues addressed include :  the                 efficient (i.e., suitable for very fast serial as well as parallel              access) structuring of large sequence databanks; techniques for the             identification of various regularities in strings; schemes for the              efficient compaction and retrieval of strings and higher structures;            variants of string searching and comparison problems; some typical              optimization problems in molecular biology; etc.  Such issues are               explored within both serial and parallel computational environments,            from a deterministic as well as a probabilistic perspective.  It also           covers some of the foundational aspects of a larger interdisciplinary           effort in cooperation with molecular biologists and biochemists.",
