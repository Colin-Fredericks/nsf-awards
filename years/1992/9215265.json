 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a nine month long-term visit by Professor               Narendra Ahuja, Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of                   Illinois at Urbana, to Japan for a cooperative research project                 with Dr. Fumio Kishino, Communications Systems Research                         Laboratories, Advanced Telecommunication Research Institute                     International (ATR) in Osaka.  They will be undertaking research                in the area of integrated image analysis and visualization.                     Professor Ahuja's current research includes  1) integration of                  the information present in diverse image cues for deriving a                    three-dimensional (3D) interpretation and  2) visually realistic                and compact depiction of scenes.  The success of a depiction is                 measured by the extent to which a human observer realistically                  perceives the desired scene characteristics from the depiction.                 Dr. Kishino's research is also concerned with both image                        interpretation and image synthesis, but for images that contain                 humans.  They use a range of image cues related to human body                   motion in performing the interpretation.  They also emphasize                   greatly the hardware implementation and prototype development                   issues.  The researchers will closely study and compare the two                 lines of research, and attempt to determine ways in which each                  PI's research could be enhanced in effectiveness by incorporating               the pertinent strengths of the other's activity.                                                                                                                Results of the research could provide great military and                        commercial potential.  Improved simulator technology could also                 be used as a scientific research tool in robotics, eliminating                  the need for real mobile robots to be built at every robotics                   laboratory.  These robots are expensive to purchase and even more               expensive to maintain and program.  Both Professor Ahuja and Dr.                Kishino are noted for very productive, high quality research.                   Likewise, both the University of Illinois and ATR are respected                 in the community for their significant research in the area of                  computer vision and visualization.  It is expected that this                    collaborative effort will continue after the formal agreement has               terminated, and it is further anticipated that useful                           publications will result from this bilateral effort.",
