 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with Dr. Peter Galison at Harvard University, the PI is                 beginning a major study of the history of biological electron                   microscopy.  He is exploring the introduction and impact of this                machine as an instrument for life sciences.  Specimen preparation               techniques, initially quite inadequate, were adapted from light                 microscopy, from non-related disciplines, and invented outright                 through the 40s and 50s.  With each major change in preparative                 technique came surprising appearances, necessitating related                    innovations in epistemological technique (e.g. micrograph                       interpretation).  Dr. Rasmussen is studying in detail a small                   number of Americans in the 40s, at institutions such as the                     Rockefeller Institute, Penn, MIT and especially RCA's  New Jersey               labs, responsible for many of the crucial innovations.  He is also              examining dissemination of students and practices from these labs               in the first postwar years.  For the period from the mid-50s to the             mid-70s, he is taking a selective approach to the burgeoning field.             To illuminate the epistemological roles of the electron microscope              in diverse biological disciplines, Dr. Rasmussen is examining                   several major controversies involving the instrument.  Finally, he              is comparing the megavolt electron microscope (introduced about                 1970) in French and American life science.  This last undertaking               provides insights into the issues of national context for science               and the prospects of \"big science\" in biology.  Because of the                  importance of this project for understanding the processes for                  introducing new instrumentation in biology, this project is being               supported both by the Biological Instrumentation and Resources                  Division and by the Office of Studies in Science, Technology and                Society.",
