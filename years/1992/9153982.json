 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to hold a Symposium on Graduate             Study in the Sciences for female science undergraduates from the                Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington) to provide them with the              information and encouragement needed to consider graduate study.  The           number of women receiving Ph.D. degrees in the sciences is far smaller          than the number of men who receive this degree, and the fraction of             female undergraduates who opt for graduate study is smaller than the            fraction of males who opt for graduate study in all scientific                  disciplines.  Those who attend this symposium will learn about graduate         education in general and about specific aspects of their chosen field.          They will also be involved in discussions about choosing a graduate             school, financial aid, life as a graduate student, preparation for              graduate study, career opportunities, and special concerns of female            students.  Sixty undergraduate participants (representing physics,              chemistry, mathematics, earth sciences, and the biological sciences)            from approximately 30 colleges and universities in Oregon and                   Washington will attend the symposium.  Symposium organizers will remain         in contact with the participants throughout their remaining                     undergraduate years and chart their progress towards graduate study.",
