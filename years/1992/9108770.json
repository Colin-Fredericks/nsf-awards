The research clusters selected for enhancement have the                         potential for national prominence and include: (1)                              Supramolecular Protein Complexes: Roles in Metabolic                            Regulation and Intracellular Structure (NDSU and UND); (2)                      Population Change and Genetic Diversity (NDSU and UND) and                      (3) Main Group Organometallic Chemistry (NDSU).  A fourth                       emerging research cluster in the area of intelligent systems                    will be supported entirely by state funds.  It will provide                     the state with a means to pursue its economic development                       strategy in advanced scientific computing.  In addition,                        outreach programs in education and human resource                               development will be conducted that build and strengthen                         partnerships between the two universities and the two- and                      four-year state colleges, Native American community                             colleges, the high schools and junior high schools in the                       state, and the general public.  The state of North Dakota                       and institutions will help build and maintain the science                       and engineering infrastructure through an outright                              contribution of $1.333 million per year in matching funds                       plus a full contribution of all indirect costs for a total                      contribution over three years of over $6.5 million.",
