 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the potential for sexual selection as an important                   factor in plant evolution is now becoming recognized, there is                  surprisingly little direct knowledge about how often conditions                 required for its actions occur.  One indication of the                          opportunity for sexual selection in plants is the occurrence of                 multiply sired fruits.  Such fruits are unambiguous evidence that               pollen from more than one mate was available to fertilize seeds,                and therefore indicate that female choice of male competition                   (forms of sexual selection) may act.  However, there is detailed                knowledge about the frequency of multiply sired fruits for only a               single, introduced species.  The P.I. will study the occurrence                 of and mechanisms causing multiply sired fruits for a native                    plant of South Western deserts, Lesquerella fendleri.  To                       determine frequency, the P.I. will ascertain paternity for seeds                from plants in 3 separate populations at the Sevilleta Long-Term                Ecological Research Site.  Preliminary studies indicate that                    Lesquerella fruits are commonly multiply sired.  To determine the               mechanisms causing multiply sired fruits two approaches will be                 taken.  First, paternity resulting from single and multiple                     pollinator visits in nature will be compared.  Second, observed                 pollinator visitation rates will be used to construct a realistic               schedule of hand pollinations to investigate the effects of                     single and multiple visits under more controlled conditions.                    Knowledge of the responsible mechanisms will not only help to                   predict which species are likely to produce multiply sired                      fruits, but can help delimit their possible evolutionary                        consequences.",
