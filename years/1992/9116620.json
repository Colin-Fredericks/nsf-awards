 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a           U.S.-Japan Seminar on Gene Regulation and Expression in                         Mitochondrial Disease and the Aging Process.  The seminar, which                will be held December 7-12, 1992, in Honolulu, Hawaii, is being                 co-organized by Professor Roderick Capaldi, Institute of Molecular              Biology, University of Oregon, and Dr. Takayuki Ozawa,                          Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Nagoya University.  The                     seminar will focus on the latest developments in basic research on              mitochondrial biogenesis, combining the interests of scientists who             study the basic process of oxidative phosphorylation with those who             study mitochondrial dysfunction in a wide variety of diseases and in            the aging process.  In addition to U.S. and Japanese scientists, the            seminar will include researchers from Australia.  This seminar                  follows a successful seminar in December 1987.                                                                                                                  The seminar topics are:  structure and replication of mitochondrial             DNA, regulation of mitochondrial molecular biology, biochemistry                of mitochondrial enzyme complexes, bioenergetics and relationship               to mitochondrial disease, nature of mitochondrial mutations                     associated with disease, mitochondria and the aging process, and                treatment of mitochondrial diseases.  The goal of the seminar is to             encourage the sharing of expertise, which could lead to                         collaboration in this important area of research.",
