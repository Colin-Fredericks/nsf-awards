 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the costs of moderate inflation.  While                 policy makers view inflation as a serious economic problem,                     economists have had difficulty identifying major costs of                       inflation.  The research explores the idea that inflation creates               variability in relative prices, and thus erodes the efficiency of               the price system.  The model developed by this project emphasizes               the role of long-term relationships.  Without long-term                         relationships, customers benefit from relative price variability                by substituting towards low-price goods.  And since firms can                   largely eliminate variability through more frequent nominal                     adjustment, which is inexpensive, variability can have only small               costs to firms.  With long-term relationships, in contrast,                     inflation reduces the information conveyed by current prices                    concerning future prices, causing consumers to make costly                      mistakes about whether to enter relationships.  In addition, the                reduced informativeness of prices makes demand less price-                      elastic, thereby increasing markups.  The research formalizes                   these ideas and investigates their quantitative importance.  The                project explores how the web of input-output relationships                      magnifies the costs of inflation; examines empirically the                      effects of inflation on relative price variability and on                       macroeconomic performance; and investigates the mismeasurement of               aggregate output under inflation.                                                                                                                               The project also investigates the causes of inflation in the                    short run.  Theories of costly price adjustment imply that firms                adjust prices more rapidly in response to large shocks than to                  small ones.  A corollary is that innovations in inflation depend                positively on the skewness of relative prices shocks; if shocks                 are skewed to the right, for example, firms adjust quickly to                   shocks in the upper tail, raising the aggregate price level.  The               project develops this idea theoretically and then tests it using                disaggregated data.",
