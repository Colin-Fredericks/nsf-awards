 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific advances in identifying, predicting and mitigating                   hazards are likely to produce significant changes in how the                    public assesses moral and ethical responsibility for disaster                   losses.  It should also affect the way in which those involved in               disaster mitigation, including design professionals, businesses,                and government officials, judge their own responsibility.  This                 project begins an examination of the factors that influence                     judgments of responsibility for losses from both technological                  and natural disasters.  This initial period of the research will                be devoted to two tasks:  the development of concept papers                     addressing the major intellectual traditions that have                          contributed to understanding of judgments of responsibility; and                the identification of the principal dimensions (and the variables               that reflect components of those dimensions) of the attribution                 of responsibility for disasters.  With the guidance of an                       interdisciplinary advisory group, in the first six months of the                project, the investigators will develop a series of concept                     papers reviewing major intellectual traditions that have been                   used to understand how people judge responsibility, and review                  case study materials in the archives of the University of                       Delaware's Disaster Research Center to identify potentially                     useful examples of disasters that can form the basis for initial                scenario development work.  Drawing on the papers and the hazards               literature, key dimensions that influence potentially different                 attributions of responsibility will be identified.  The second                  half of the project will generate a set of relevant dimensions                  and a large number of scenarios.  The dimensions will then be                   varied experimentally to examine how they influence lay                         judgments.  Premiminary work will be conducted with convenience                 samples .  However, to produce generalizable data from this phase               of the research, the investigators also plan to conduct some of                 the secnario development work with paid subjects from the                       community and with representatives of one \"stakeholder\" group,                  most likely engineers.  The first year of the project will                      procude a set of scenarios to be used in experimental and survey                phases of the research.  The scenarios will be based on an                      analysis of the subjects' responses.  The concept papers will be                published in various outlets, and the early experimental analysis               should also result in publishable papers addressing the                         methodological issues involved in scenario-based research as well               as conceptual development of attribution processes for disaster                 consequences.",
