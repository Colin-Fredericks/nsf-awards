 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the geometric structure and  develops efficient geometric algorithms for the following   areas:  (1)  Arrangements and configurations, including the   complexity of a  single cell, zones and envelopes, space partitions, and   of lines in space;  (2)  Geometric algorithms for robot motion planning,   including motion  planning for various systems with 3 degrees of freedom,   planning based on generalized voronoi diagrams in 3 space,   extremal placements and high-clearance motion;  (3)  Visibility problems in three dimensions, including   output-sensitive   hidden surface removal, and ray shooting and tracing;  (4)  Randomized techniques in geometry, including design and   of randomized geometric algorithms, epsilon-nets, and   of geometric algorithms; and  (5)  Applications and related problems, including k-sets in  arrangements, union of geometric objects, geometric   optimization,  layout of graphs in the plane, incidence and distance   problems, and  transversal problems.  A theme in many of the investigated research areas is the   study of  problems in higher dimensional space and involving curved   (rather than flat objects in 2 or 3 dimensions).  Such    problems are  much harder to tackle than problems traditionally studied in  computational geometry, but are essential for many   applications (such  as those mentioned above).  Another theme is the rich cross-fertilization between basic   in computational geometry and the various application areas,   problems in one area motivate the study of new basic problems   solution in turn finds applications in many other areas.  As the algorithms and techniques become more refined and   efficient,  they are implemented to test their pragmatic feasibility.",
