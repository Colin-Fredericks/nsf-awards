 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program will be undertaken under the Materials Synthesis             and Processing Initiative to develop and apply new theoretical and              simulational modeling techniques to problems of growth and                      deposition of materials.  With the development of high resolution               experimental techniques as well as recent advances in our                       theoretical understanding of noneqilibrium surface growth                       phenomena, it is possible to develop a better understanding of the              growth and deposition of materials using theoretical ideas based on             continuum models as well as realistic molecular dynamics and Monte              Carlo simulations.  In particular, the following projects will be               undertaken: order-disorder transition in epitaxial growth; strain               relaxation in thin film growth; theoretical models of thin film                 growth; microscopic modeling of chemical vapor deposition and                   growth instabilities; and, modeling the formation of porous                     silicon.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Analytical and computational modeling will be done to understand                the deposition of materials onto substrates and their subsequent                growth.  This work has an impact on fundamental condensed matter                physics and on materials science.  In the latter category it                    directly relates to many materials in which thin films play a                   critical role such as coatings for corrosion and wear protection;               optical coatings; and, microelectronics.  This reserach project is              part of the FY92 NSF Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative.",
