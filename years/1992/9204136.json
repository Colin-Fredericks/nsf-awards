 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Professors Allison and Leroi will study                     the matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy of mass-selected                     ions.  Based on early promising experiments carried out under                   their previous grant, these researchers will develop a new                      methodology via laser-induced fluorescence and Fourier                          transform infrared spectroscopy of small cations in neon                        matrices at 4 K.  Structural analysis of both organic and                       organometallic cations, co-deposited with counter ions, will                    be demonstrated.  Complementary theoretical calculations of                     ionic structures and vibrational frequencies will also be                       carried out.  The goals of this work are to provide a new tool                  for the structural characterization of molecular ions as well                   as to probe the structure/function relationships governing                      organometallic chemistry.                                                       %%%                                                                             The collaborating principal investigators have designed and                     constructed a unique instrument which is a marriage of two                      completely different types of spectroscopy, one which                           separates different ions according to their masses, the other                   which measures the characteristic absorption or emission of                     light by molecules or ions.  This technique should aid in the                   determination of the molecular structures of transient species                  as well as in the elucidation of mechanisms of ion-molecule                     reactions which are important to many areas of atmospheric,                     environmental, and materials sciences.",
