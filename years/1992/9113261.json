Bergman of the Chemistry Department, University of                           California at Berkeley in the area of organometallic chemistry.                 Synthesis and reactions of heterobimetallic compounds composed                  of early-late transition metals linked by a variety of bridging                 groups will be studied.  One of the investigations concerns                     soluble compounds with bridging methylene and alkylidene                        ligands and metals centers of tantalum and platinum or tantalum                 and cobalt, which have been found to act as catalysts for the                   hydrogenation, isomerization, and hydrosilation of alkenes, as                  well as for the coversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to                    methane and the conversion of methanol and carbon monoxide to                   acetic acid.  The mechanism of these catalytic processes will                   be determined, particuarly with regard to stereochemistry, and                  the effectiveness of other combinations of metals tested.                       %%%                                                                             The goal of the project is to develop methods for the                           systematic synthesis of new molecules containing two transition                 metal centers and to explore the details of their reactions                     with organic molecules.  The two metals will be an early (e.g.,                 Zr or Ta) and a late (e.g., Ir or Co) transition metal, and                     will have different electronic properties.  They are connected                  by bridging groups containing carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and                     sulfur, which can react with organic molecules in novel ways                    because of the influence of the bimetallic environment.  The                    findings of this research are relevant to reactions in                          complicated multi-metal systems such as catalytic surfaces.",
