The project will focus on improving mathematics and science                     education in grades K - 8.  Virginia conducted an extensive                     needs assessment and from this developed the seven                              components of V-QUEST:                                                                                                                                          1.   Creating a school-based mathematics and science lead                            teachers initiative;                                                                                                                                       2.

Supporting mathematics and science education through                            the state's telecommunications system (V-PEN); and                                                                                                         7.

The PI will work with seven component coordinators, a State                     Action Council, and ten Local Action Councils to create a                       management structure that links content (through the                            components) with a process (State and Local Action Councils)                    for local involvement.",
