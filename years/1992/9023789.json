 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conceptually new aspect of insect population biology                  studies is the bridging of theory on the evolution of mating                    systems and theory of population dynamics..which so far have been               developed independently.  Factors that ultimately affect the                    growth and dynamics of populations simultaneously determine                     behaviors involved in the mate search and resource defense.                             Ecologists are increasingly taking a more mechanistic                   approach to explaining patterns in populations and communities.                 That is,  they try to explain the \"higher level\" patterns in                    populations and communities, such as population dynamics or                     species diversity, by examining \"lower level\" phenomena, such as                behavior, physiology and morphology of individuals, which                       determine the individual's ability to survive and reproduce.  The               research program proposed here fits into this new trend in                      examining how determinants of mating behavior and an individual's               use of habitat and food resources relate to population structure                and dynamics and eventually to interspecific interactions.                              The specific system of study comprises several species of               Lordotus bee flies.  Species in this genus have different                       morphologies related to mating behavior and presumably have                     different mating behaviors.  Preliminary studies of two congeners               at one site reveal that, indeed, they have different mating                     systems and populations structures although they occur                          syntopically and use the same resources.                                                The proposed program will focus primarily on detailed                   population studies of these two species and will test hypotheses                proposed by Bradbury and colleagues on the evolution of lek                     mating systems from resource.defense territoriality.  This                      research plan will include detailed characterization of occupied                and randomly.chosen unoccupied sites, long.term monitoring of                   population densities, and experimental manipulation of sites and                population densities.  In the last two (of five) seasons, work                  will continue on the demography and mating system of L. miscellus               and pilot studies will be initiated on a parapatric species L.                  gibbus.  Together, detailed studies on these closely related and                ecologically similar species constitute a powerful comparative                  approach to testing hypotheses on the relations among resource                  distributions, mating systems, and population structures.",
