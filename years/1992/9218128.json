 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to create a new unified upper level                 synthesis and processing laboratory that will integrate the                     synthesis and processing of all of the various materials classes.               The experience provided by this new laboratory will complement and              enhance the core curriculum, which was established at MIT a decade              ago with the specific goal of exposing students to the fundamental              unifying concepts of materials science and engineering.  With the               introduction of this new synthesis and processing laboratory,                   students for the first time will have the opportunity to                        experimentally explore porcessing-structure property relationships              in a wide variety of different materials, including composites.                 Emphasis will be placed on design-oriented projects in which                    students will work in teams with well-defined goals and project                 missions.  Laboratories will be designed to expose students to the              importance of computers in modern processing, in process design and             simulation, in data acquisition, and in process control.  The                   program will be evaluated through student entrance and exit                     evaluations, recommendations of a Visiting Committee, and an ad hoc             industrial panel.  In addition to the development and                           implementation of the new laboratory, comprehensive student                     workbooks and instructor's guides will be generated for use by                  other institutions, and educational symposia will be held at                    professional society meetings.",
