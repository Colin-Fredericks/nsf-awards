 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing computational models of structure-from-motion are based                on variations of optical flow or feature point correspondences                  within the interior of single objects.  This project investigates               a new, boundary-based cue for determining motion and shape.  An                 approach is outlined for determining that an object is rotating                 in depth.  Only simple, qualitative computations are required,                  avoiding the need to accurately determine how flow patterns are                 varying over the surface of interest.  Generalizations involving                integration of boundary and surface cues will be explored.                      Ultimately, the approach will be extended to other types of                     motion such as translation of a wide field-of-view cameras.To                   support this boundary-based analysis improved methods will be                   evaluated for estimating optical flow in the presence of flow                   discontinuities.  The proposed algorithm integrates flow/surface                analysis with the structure-from-motion determination while                     addressing certain deficiencies in previously proposed                          techniques.  Results from this study should provide more general                reliable, and economical methods for dealing with the important                 problems involved in analyzing visual motion.",
