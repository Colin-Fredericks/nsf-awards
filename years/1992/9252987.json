The overall goal of                     the model is to enlarge the potential pool of students who                      are competent in science and technology to include more                         girls, children of color, with disabilities, and children                       from low-income families.  By engaging parents in                               partnership with schools and community organizations,                           Playtime Is Science will increase the science literacy of                       young children (ages 4-7) as well as that of their parents                      and other adults in their lives.                                                                                                                                This three-year project, built on a successful local model                      developed in New York City public schools, will include the                     following activities:  training and networking for site                         liaisons; pilot testing and evaluation at three sites chosen                    for geographic, racial, ethnic, language, and socioeconomic                     diversity; materials development and production; a formal                       research study; and intensive national dissemination of                         Playtime Is Science materials package.  Materials to be                         developed include 1)  four videotapes to provide a visual                       rendering of the program for parents, teachers, and                             administrators; 2)  a how-to manual providing easy-to-follow                    instructions for implementing the program; 3)  and a home                       activity booklet for parents illustrating science activities                    which utilize inexpensive, readily-available materials found                    in every home.",
