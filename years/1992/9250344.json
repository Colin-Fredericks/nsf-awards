 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific investigation, the process of formulating                            hypotheses, designing experiments, and analyzing results is a                   critical aspectof any undergraduate program seeking to produce                  graduates capable of critical thought.  This important aspect                   of education has been missing from many computer science                        programs.  Introductory computer science courses are typically                  taught with heavy emphasis towards programming assignments.                     Students tend to perceive computer science as the tedious and                   repetitious study of writing relatively simple computer                         programs.  Scientifically oriented students are often drawn                     from the mundane task of introductory programming to more                       dynamic fields of experimentation and analysis.  These students                 never experience the enormous variety and challenge of computer                 problem solving.                                                                This project is designed to alter the way computer science is                   taught at the introductory level.  Four laboratory courses have                 been specifically designed to serve both as a solid foundation                  forundergraduate majors and minors as well as to expose                         non-majors tothe exciting and varied facets of computer                         science.  The courses,Foundations I & II, provide a                             breadth-first introduction to major fields within computer                      science.  The course, Computer Problem Solving, augments the                    foundations courses with a problem solving perspective of                       computer programming.  Students will use supplied abstract data                 types and alternative problem solving methods such as dynamic                   programming and divide-and-conquer in the solution and analysis                 of classic computer science problems.  The fourth course, Data                  Structures extends this problem-solving perspective by                          comparing and analyzing alternative implementations of the                      abstract data types used in the computer problem-solving                        courses.  All four courses combine laboratory and lecture to                    produce a dynamic environment of hands-on experimentation and                   analysis.",
