 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the incorporation of a diverse rural                       population into the banana industry of Belize. An anthropologist                from the University of South Alabama will conduct an ethnographic               study of ethnic diversity in the recruitment and deployment of                  workers from Black and Indian ethnic origins.  The project will                 examine the differences between ethnicity and class as causes of                labor force participation by interviewing workers, growers, and                 processors in depth, on their values and opinions about the                     appropriate work for members of different ethnic groups.                                                                                                        This research is important because ethnic hostilities are a                     common cause of labor force troubles.  This case study of a local               industry in a multi-ethnic area will provide valuable information               on the nature of ethnic hostility, and how it relates to socio-                 economic class differences.  This information will be valuable to               those concerned with minimizing ethnic antagonisms in labor                     forces in similar situations.",
