 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor William C. Agosta of the                          Rockefeller University for continued collaboration in organic                   chemistry with Professor Paul Margaretha of the Instiute for                    Organic Chemistry of the University of Hamburg, Germany.  Their                 joint research focuses on three problems in the chemistry of alkyl              propargyl biradicals.  One is a mechanistic study of the influence              of spin state on the behavior of vinyl carbene intermediates.                   Another is an extension of their recently discovered (3+2) reaction             between alkenes and 3-alkynyl-2-cycloalkenones to intramolecular                systems.  The final is an exploration of the photochemical                      cycloaddition of 2-alkynyl-2-cycloalkenones with alkenes, both                  inter- and intra-molecularly.  The two laboratories have                        complementary strengths and characteristics.  Professor Agosta's                interests are in the design and synthesis of particular substrates to           probe mechanisms and to search for new processes.  His small                    group at The Rockefeller University is composed of postdoctoral                 workers.  Professor Margaretha has particular expertise in chemical             theory and radical theory.  His research group in Hamburg is much               larger than Professor Agosta's and is composed of doctoral                      students, which makes it better able to carry out studies requiring             greater manpower.                                                                                                                                               The long term goals of the above research are to understand better              the conditions under which alkyl propargyl biradicals are formed                and to define the mechanism of conversion of these biradicals to                vinyl carbenes and from them to stable products.  Professors                    Agosta and Margaretha discovered alkyl propargyl biradicals in                  1981.  Their current and proposed work all involve either new                   chemistry or novel mechanistic studies in this general area.",
