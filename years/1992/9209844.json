 "awd_abstract_narration": "While there is evidence that learning plays a role in the                       development of the correct usage of certain vocalizations in                    several species of monkeys and apes, there are few studies that                 have demonstrated such plasticity in the production of calls.                   The present research investigates developmental complexity in                   primate vocal communication.  Behavioral data, tape-recordings,                 and computer-aided spectrography will be used to study the                      acquisition and significance of pigtail macaque (Macaca                         nemestrina) vocal \"signatures.\"  The project focuses on                         recruitment screams, vocalizations that have been found to                      designate events and objects in the animals' external environment               and that thus are rudimentarily semantic.  Calls used in the                    recruitment of allies during fights require knowledge of kinship                and dominance relationships in the group and are therefore ideal                to test hypotheses that learning may be involved in the                         development of nonhuman primate vocal behavior.  These calls have               \"signature\" information in their acoustic structure that may                    serve to identify kin groups.  Foster-reared infants will be                    studied for evidence that they acquire the signature of their                   adoptive matriline.                                                                                                                                             The long-term aim of this research on the vocal communication of                monkeys is to explore cognitive dimensions of primate behavior                  that may ultimately provide insights into the evolutionary                      origins of human language.  Results should also contribute to a                 better understanding of the criteria for appropriate primate                    models for studies of language acquisition.",
