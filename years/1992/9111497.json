 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator analyzes the large systems of coupled                     oscillators that arise in various branches of biology and                       condensed-matter physics.  A common theme is the spontaneous                    emergence of synchronization due to cooperative interactions                    among the oscillators.  The systems of ordinary differential                    equations that constitute the models will be investigated                       analytically and numerically.  Techniques to be used include                    methods of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, statistical                   visualization of the many-osillator dynamics plays a                            crucial heurisc role in the research.  Several of the taksk are                 expected to generate experimentally testable predictions.                            The mathematical problems studied here are models of                       behavior as varied as the beating of a heart, the patterned                     flashing groups of fireflies, or the circadian rhythm.                          Specific areas to be studied include:  phase models with a large                but finite number of oscillators; pulse-coupled oscillators                     with distributed frequencies or local coupling; phase-locking                   and invariant 2-tori in arrays of Josephson junctions; arrays                   of electronic relaxation oscillators; coupled oscillator models                 for the Drosophila circadian system; and delayed switching of                   charge-density.",
