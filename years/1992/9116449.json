 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will investigate how human operators interact with                 automated manufacturing systems, with a view to developing models               to support the rational design of the role of human operators in                such systems.  In particular, it will investigate the conditions                which lead to human intervention in the control of automated                    systems.  A real time interactive simulation will allow operators               to experiment with different modes and strategies of intervention,              and discover when to take control and when to hand it back.                     Particular attention will be paid to the human role under two                   system control policies.  The first is hierarchical, where the                  human interacts with the system through one central controller.                 The second, which has not been empirically investigated in this                 context before, is heterarchical, where control is distributed                  among all the machines in the manufacturing cell and the human is               just one of many entities.  This research will further our                      understanding of human-machine symbiosis, and will lead to                      improvements in advanced manufacturing systems which, having a                  sound scientific basis, will help to make such systems more                     productive and competitive.",
