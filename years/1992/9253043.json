 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term goal of this project is to understand DNA repair pathways,          recovery processes and enzymes important in the complex cellular                responses to radiomimetic damage.  this proposal focuses upon the               molecular cloning and characterizations of mutants (blm) isolated in            this laboratory on the basis of their hypersensitivities to killing by          ionizing radiation and a radiomimetic family of chemical congeners.             Studies are designed to improve our understanding of radiomimetic               damage to eucaryotic cells, how cells respond to and reverse the                damage, and multiple mechanisms for processing chromosomal injury.              Objectives include determining 1) the BLM1, BLM3, BLM5, and BLM8                nuclear genes, gene products and functions, 2) additional genetic and           functional relationships among blm genes and relationships of blm               genes to specific rad mutations, 3) genetic mapping of the mutations,           4) the role of BLM nuclear genes involved in maintaining normal                 chromosomal structure and function after radiomimetic damage, and               5) the relationship of chromatic lesions and their repair to cellular           survival and recovery.  Genetic characterizations, molecular cloning            and sequence analyses, DNA repair techniques, electrophoretic and               sedimentation analyses, and enzyme assays will be utilized.  The                genetic sophistication, molecular flexibility and availability of mutant        strains of eucaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae permit these studies             and technical approaches.",
