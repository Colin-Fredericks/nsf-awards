 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists in a                U.S.-Japan Seminar on Membrane Fusion:  Approaches to Molecular                 Mechanisms in Biological and Model Membranes.  The co-organizers                of the seminar are Dr. Demetrios Papahadjopoulos, Cancer Research               Institute, University of California, San Francisco, and                         Dr. Shun-ichi Ohnishi, Department of Biophysics, Kyoto                          University.  It will be held November 8-12, 1992 in the Kyoto                   International Conference Hall.  The topics to be discussed                      include:  fusion of model membranes, fusion induced by peptides                 and proteins, fusion of viruses with liposomes and erythrocyte                  ghosts, fusion of viruses with cell membranes, cell-cell fusion,                fusion of myoblasts and sperm-egg fusion, molecular mechanisms,                 and intracellular transport and fusion.                                                                                                                         Membrane fusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological                        systems, but the molecules that regulate it and its molecular                   mechanisms are largely unknown.  Many groups around the world                   have taken a variety of approaches to the problem and are                       studying different biological and model membrane systems.                       Japanese investigators have been at the forefront of research on                the mechanisms of virus-cell and virus-induced cell-cell fusion.                Dr. Ohnishi's laboratory is a center for the development of                     innovative ideas in membrane fusion.  The laboratory of Dr.                     Papahadjopoulos is a center for the development of new assays for               membrane fusion and for investigations on the role of lipids and                proteins in membrane fusion.  This seminar will strengthen ties                 that already exist among the U.S. and Japanese investigators and                provide a forum for the generation of new ideas and                             collaborations.",
