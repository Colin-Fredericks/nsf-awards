 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finance and economics theorists assume preferences predicted               by expected utility (EU) theory hold at the market level even as                evidence mounts that some of those predictions are violated at the              individual level.  The objective of this project is to determine                the role of markets in disciplining behavior toward EU outcomes.                Specifically, is the distribution of EU violations different if                 subjects participate in market-level decisions before individual-               level decisions?  Do market design and gain versus loss payoffs                 affect the degree of discipline provided by markets?  Without                   empirical empirical evidence that EU holds at the market level                  while its predictions are violated at the individual level, the                 disciplines of finance and economics are ignoring possible                      weaknesses in the models and opportunities to improve them.                          Proposed laboratory experiments will record subjects'                      individual-level preferences for pairs of gambles which are                     selected with specific constraints.  Subjects will be given the                 opportunity to participate in markets for these gambles.                        Individual and market preferences will be compared with those                   predicted by EU theory.  If the preferences violate EU theory at                the individual level but support it at the market level, there is               empirical support for the robustness of economic and finance models             dependent upon the EU assumption.  If the preferences do not                    support EU at the market level, then these models may have to be                reformulated independently of the EU assumption.",
