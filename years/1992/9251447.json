 "awd_abstract_narration": "The power systems curriculum at the North Carolina A&T State                    University is being updated, infusing more computer and control                 systems applications into the program.  In line with this                       scheduled update, the undergraduate power laboratory is being                   upgraded in three phases - the digital application phase (1991-                 1993), the control application phase (1993 - 1995), and the                     replacement of current old equipment phase.  In this project,                   focusing on the first phase, personal computers are being                       introduced into the undergraduate power laboratory.  The                        present analog meters are being replaced with IEEE-488 standard                 meters.  The meters are interfaced with the PCs through a data                  acquisition board.  The objective of this phase is to introduce                 the students to the use of computers in power systems                           operation.  The laboratory procedures emphasize:  (1)                           principles of collection and conversion of analog data to                       digital data; (2) programming (and use of standard menu-driven                  software) to select, display, or store required data, and                       perform simple analysis; and (3) the concept of energy (power                   x time) and energy conservation which is not possible with the                  present instantaneous data collection process.  In the control                  systems application phase, the students will be introduced to                   the use of control and digital systems to control power systems                 elements.",
