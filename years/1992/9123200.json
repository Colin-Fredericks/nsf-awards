 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synchronous machines are an important class of high performance                 computers.  Machines of this type include linear and systolic arrays            such as the WARP machine, two dimensional arrays such as the Massively          Parallel Computer, and machines with more complex interconnections              such as the Connection Machine.  The importance of this class of                machines is due in large measure to the scalability of the                      architecture.  Synchronous machines can be built containing hundreds            of thousands of processors.  This scalability, however, implies a               corresponding increase in the complexity of the overall program                 running on the machine and, hence, in the difficulty of reasoning,              either formally or informally, about the correctness of that program.                                                                                           The objective of this research is to develop methods for the formal             verification of programs running on synchronous parallel machines--             specifically machines consisting of a large number of processors that           execute copies of the same program and communicate using message                passing.  The basic approach is to prove assertions about a single              copy of the program and, from this proof, infer properties of the               entire assembly of programs.  The goal is to develop a complete                 formal theory based on this approach.                                                                                                                           As with all formal methods for reasoning about programs, the concepts,          theorems, and general approach can be expected to have a significant            benefit on software development for such machines--even when that               software is developed informally.  The software designer must                   certainly reason about the correctness of the software even if that             reasoning is done informally.  Formal methods can provide a guide to            how to perform that reasoning.",
