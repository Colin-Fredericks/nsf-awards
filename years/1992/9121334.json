 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              parallel computing and software libraries between Jack Dongarra of              the University of Tennessee and Bernard Tourancheau of the                      Laboratory for Parallel Computing at the Ecole Normale                          Superieure, Lyon, France.  The investigators seek to develop high               performance communication and computation routines for linear                   algebra algorithms on distributed-memory supercomputers.  Dr.                   Dongarra's group brings to this collaboration experience in                     developing software libraries for linear algebra subroutines.  This             is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in linear                algebra algorithms and access to unique parallel computers in                   Lyon.                                                                                                                                                           Recent advances in the development of software libraries have led               to better, more efficient software performance and a greater                    portability amongst machines.  Research has progressed from                     vector computers to shared-memory computers and currently is                    focused on distributed memory systems for high performance                      supercomputers.  This collaborative effort is oriented towards the              development of software libraries for distributed memory systems.               The ultimate goal is the development of a standardized code and                 portable software libraries for the supercomputers of the future.",
