 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory will be developed for the electronic and vibrational                     properties of metals, insulators and superconductors, especially                crystalline oxides such as copper-and bismuth-oxide superconductors             and vanadium-oxide based metal-insulator systems.  The underlying               motive is to explore the still obscure mechanism for high                       temperature superconductivity.  A secondary motive for the research             is to improve understanding of the diverse and poorly understood                electrical transport properties of these materials.  As a model                 system barium-bismuth-oxide will be studied in detail.  The charge              carriers in this insulator are bipolarons.  A continuous evolution              through an exotic superconducting state to a normal metallic                    conductor occurs as bismuth is replaced by lead.  Polaron and                   bipolaron models will be developed and tested to model resistivity,             Hall coefficient, and superconductivity.  Other model systems to be             studied are niobium-oxide and vanadium-dioxide.  The latter has a               metal-insulator transition at a temperature convenient for device               applications such as memory elements.  The effect of lattice                    distortion and phonons on the transition will be studied.  Thermal              conduction will also be studied in a model of amorphous silicon.",
