This conference offers a unique                       opportunity for scientists from a broad group of disciplines, who               share an interest in folate, B12 and one carbon metabolism, to                  interact both formally and informally.  Sessions have been                      scheduled on the biosynthesis of folic acid and cobalamin, on the               mechanisms of folate- and cobalamin-dependent enzymes, on the                   structures of these enzymes, on transport and compartmentation of               folates, antifolates and cobalamin derivatives, and on clinical                 evaluation of antifolates now in various phases of clinical trail.              A second major focus will be on the role of folate and                          B12-dependent enzymes in metabolism.  Sessions are planned on the               evaluation ofthe nutritional of both normal and diseased humans,                and the effects on metabolism of drugs that intervene in folate and             cobalamin-dependent reactions.                                                  %%%                                                                             This conference will bring together researchers and students who                are exploring the basic biochemistry and health/disease aspects of              folic acid, vitamin B12 and one carbon metabolism.  There will be               formal presentations of advances in these fields and informal                   discussions.",
