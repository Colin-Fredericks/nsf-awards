 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work includes several topics in price theory.  The first major             topic develops analyses of multiproduct pricing and related                     problems of taxation, regulation, and contracting.  This includes               several tasks: elaboration of some basic results to take advantage              of implicit bundling, extensions of an alternative formulation that             relies only on observable demand data, development of computational             methods for both formulations, and exposition of applications to                practical aspects of multiproduct pricing in industries such as                 communications and power.  Also, these methods will be used to                  elaborate a more general theory of optimal mechanism design that                allows risk aversion, correlated information, and other realistic               features.                                                                                                                                                       The second major topic develops the theory of the option value                  component of the prices of flexible substitutes for irreversible                durable investments, including the characterization of optimal                  investment policies in such contexts.  The main applications are                to prices of sulfur dioxide emission allowances for electric                    utilities, and to investments to reduce or alleviate the effects                of global warming.                                                                                                                                              Additional topics include studies applying theories of bargaining               to labor negotiations and to pre-trial negotiations between                     litigants,  and development of computational methods for computing              stable equilibria.  This study will have important contributions                in many fields.  For example, the solution to the class of pricing              problems may be helpful in such matters as space shuttle cargo                  allocation and allocation of computer time among several users.                 The option value study would be relevant for policy issues                      concerning the abatement of global warming by limiting carbon                   emissions.",
