 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal project is a case study of popular reaction to                     market reform in the formerly planned economies.  Using the case                of urban China, this study will examine popular reaction to                     reform by different groups and to different reform programs.  It                is argued that the success of market reform depends not only on                 changing the economic system, but also on the acceptance of                     values related to market conditions, such as uncertainty,                       insecurity and inequality.  The data for this study are based on                18 national public opinion surveys conducted between 1985 and                   1991 in urban China.  The surveys cover a broad range of topics                 to ensure a systematic examination of the different reform                      programs.  Similar questions were repeated in these surveys over                a significant time span so that events can be examined over time.               The Chinese PI will bring the survey data to the U.S. and spend                 one year at the University of Pittsburg to work with the U.S. PI                on the project.  The results of the analyses will be published in               monograph form.  This research will be meaningful not only for                  understanding the reform process in China, but also for                         understanding other formerly planned economies that are                         undergoing transition to market and democracy.",
