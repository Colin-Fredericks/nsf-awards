 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation into the timing of federal                     government prime contract awards, and has two main thrusts.  First,             it attempts to refine knowledge of carefully timed economic                     expansions; scholars over the last decade have suggested that                   governments may attempt to stimulate the economy in an attempt to               bolster the election prospects of incumbents (the Political                     Business Cycle).  Despite the plausibility of such cycles, attempts             to find consistent patterns have failed, largely because so few                 macroeconomic policies are easily controlled by incumbents; as                  such, it is very difficult for them to orchestrate economic                     expansions to coincide with elections.  Prime contract awards,                  however, are easily timed, and they also have immediate economic                effects.  A plausible hypothesis that will be evaluated in this                 project, then, is that contract awards will increase before                     elections.                                                                                                                                                      Second, the literature on Congressional-bureaucratic relations is               clear on the importance of executive branch officials maintaining               good relations with members of Congress, particularly those who                 have influence over agency budgets.  Carefully timed contract                   awards are likely to be seen as an excellent way to maintain                    goodwill on the Hill, particularly since contract timing strategies             are legal, and easily implemented.  Past work on government grant               programs has suggested that agencies time grant awards to coincide              with elections in the districts of influential legislators, this                project will extend that work to include prime contract awards                  which invlove hundreds of billions of dollars annualy.                                                                                                          The project will use monthly data on contract awards for the twelve             federal agencies most active in procurement activity, with accurate             data on the location of the recipient individuals of firms; these               data have rarely been subjected to rigorous analysis.  For nearly               twety years, scholars have been lamenting the lack of such accurate             data.  The objective is to determine whether contracts are in fact              timed to coincide with elections, and to identify who benefits from             the practice.  The project will show more clearly patterns not only             of the distribution of prime contracts, but also patterns of                    timing.  The results will extend our understanding of the                       Political-Business Cycle phenomenon, as well as theories of                     congressional-agency relations.",
