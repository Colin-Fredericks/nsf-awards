 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shafer is developing a foundation for probability that                accommodates the diversity of its uses in the normative and                     descriptive sciences.  This foundation goes against the grain of                established interpretations of probability, but it revives many                 older insights.  It incorporates insights from pure mathematics,                where the fundamental role of martingales and filtrations in the                theory of stochastic processes is well recognized, as well as                   insights from applied statistics, where the appeal of conditional               methods has conflicted with the established interpretations.                                                                                                    The basic idea of Professor Shafer's study is that probability                  should be founded not on measure theory but on the classical                    picture of a fair game of chance, where probabilities are                       simultaneously fair prices, reasonable degrees of belief, and, in               some cases, long-run frequencies.  The applications of probability              are diverse because there are many ways of relating practical                   problems to this classical picture.                                                                                                                             Professor Shafer's approach to probability implies a new                        understanding of statistical models.  These models no longer                    represent merely frequencies or merely beliefs.  Instead, they                  represent a relation between certain facts about the long-run and               the knowledge of the observer.                                                                                                                                  The project involves several different kinds of research.                       Alternate axiomatizations of the classical picture need to be                   explored and a variety of theoretical issues in statistics need to              be related to the proposed new foundation.  The ideas need to be                related to the historical development of probability and to                     established debates about the meaning of probability in statistics              and science.  This project promises contributions to the                        foundations of probability important both for philosophy of science             and for mathematicians interested in probability and statistics.",
