 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the universality of ribosomes in procaryotic and eucaryotic             cells, the majority of our knowledge of their structure, function               and synthesis has been developed through decades of intensive study             of bacterial ribosomes, predominantly in E. coli.  In contrast to               bacteria, eucaryotic cell maintain distinctly different sets of                 ribosomes for protein synthesis in cytoplasm, chloroplasts, and                 mitochondria.  An important research objective is to understand the             features of eucaryotic ribosomes that represent special adaptations             to complex genomic organization and subcellular comparmentalization             for eucaryotic cells.  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a                  fertile experimental system for the analysis of both organellar and             cytoplasmic ribosomes within a single cell.  Several laboratories               are studying yeast cytoplasmic ribosomes, our goal is to contribute             complementary information about yeast mitochondrial ribosomes and               their constituents.  The principal function of the mitochondrial                translation system in yeast is to produce a small number of                     subunits for the energy-transducing complexes of the inner                      membrane.  To accomplish this task, both the nuclear mitochondrial              genes are used to encode the requisite RNAs and proteins of the                 translational apparatus.  With the exception of one protein of the              small ribosomal subunit (VAR1), all of the ribosomal proteins are               encoded by 60-70 different nuclear genes.  Of the four such genes               characterized by us MRP7 and MRP20 are particularly intriguing                  because they encode proteins that are related to the EL27 and EL23              proteins, respectively, of the E. coli 50S ribosomal subunit. Both              MRP& and MRP20 are essential proteins in yeast, and there is strong             experimental evidence for close physical proximity between EL27 and             the peptidyltransferase center of the E. coli ribosome.  EL23 is a              primary rRNA binding protein, which may also be located near the                peptidvltransferase center.  The research objectives of this                    proposal are based on the contention that MRP7 and MRP20, like                  their bacterial counterparts, are likely to be close to an                      important catalytic center of the ribosome.  We intend to use a                 combined molecular genetic and biochemical approach to : 1) gain                additional information about the synthesis, structure, and function             of the MRP7 and MRP20 or both.  The research will provide new                   insight into the structure and function of proteins that are                    located in a highly conserved functional domain of the ribosome.",
