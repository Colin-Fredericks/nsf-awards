 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Escalante Math and Science Program\" is an instructional                    program at East Los Angeles College that involves many                          elements that research has shown are characteristic of highly                   successful programs: a comprehensive well-developed plan,                       dedicated staff, parental involvement, community support,                       motivation strategies, agreed-upon objectives, coordinated                      support services, and a willingness to challenge institutional                  policies.                                                                                                                                                       This program will increase the number of students who are at                    and above grade level in mathematics and science and in                         addition will prepare inner-city , under-represented students                   for the Advanced Placement Test in calculus, computer science,                  chemistry, English, and physics.                                                                                                                                The program will develop a formal process to bring together                     teachers, counselors, and staff from junior high schools, high                  schools, community colleges, and four year colleges to improve                  course articulation and to better address the unique needs of                   the target population.                                                                                                                                          A leadership component assures that the project will be                         disseminated to other schools in the Los Angeles area.                          Substantial cost-sharing from the school district, industry,                    and East Los Angeles College indicates extensive support for                    this program.",
