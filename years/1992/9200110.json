 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student in a tribal area of Thailand.  The student                 will examine how local tribal peoples have changed their social                 organization in response to government activities in the region.                He hypothesizes that the recent increase in local-community                     social hierarchies is related to access to government programs                  which provide access to income.  His method will be to focus on                 three villages selected to vary along the dimension of local-                   state interactions.  Using participant observation and structured               interviews, he will study how people think of their relationships               with the state institutions they are aware of.  He will conduct                 weekly economic surveys in these villages as well as a wider                    socio-economic survey of an additional 8 villages.                                                                                                              This research is important because tribal peoples everywhere are                in intimate contact with state (and international) programs.                    Understanding how one regional case has evolved can help decision               makers understand how to influence people in similar areas to                   change their behavior to stimulate beneficial economic                          development.",
