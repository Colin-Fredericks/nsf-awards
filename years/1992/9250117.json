 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort takes a different approach to modeling job                    matches than previous theoretical research.  Rather than viewing a              bad match as a mistake that will be corrected by turnover when                  more information is available, matches in which workers are either              over- or under-qualified may in fact be optimal, both ex ante and               ex post.  In particular, from the firm's point of view, although                turnover will be higher for an overqualified worker, hiring and                 training costs will be lower.  Further, over-qualified workers                  constitute a pool from which promotions are made, thereby                       reducing hiring costs for higher level positions.  For under-qualified          workers, hiring and training costs will be higher but turnover will             be lower, since such workers will have fewer alternative                        opportunities.  Employers are aware of these tradeoffs and                      knowingly hire mismatched workers.  Similarly, workers realize that             they are in a bad match, but enter such matches knowingly due to                search and mobility costs and because of opportunities for                      promotion.  Previous empirical research has been restricted by                  data availability to examining only education match with the                    worker's current job.  The new data set used in this research is                unique in that it provides extensive information on match between               entry level requirements and worker qualifications, as well as                  information on promotions, training, and other information that                 allows a more general quantification of job match quality.                      Consistent with the implications of the model, empirical results                indicate that workers who are over-qualified at hire receive less               training and more promotions, and that workers over-qualified for               their current job are more likely to quit.  Gender differences in               training and promotions, and working conditions as determinants                 or job match quality, are also examined.                                              The significance of the research for examining the labor                  market is that it explains why firms hire workers that are both                 under- and over-qualified for jobs, and why workers accept jobs                 for which they are either under- or over-qualified.  It adds to our             knowledge of the wage gap between men and women by                              examining gender differences in quits and promotions.  The                      research also contributes to public policy debate about the role of             higher education in the labor market since some researchers have                been concerned about over-education, arguing that it is correlated              with a number of attributes thought to adversely affect productivity.           This project demonstrates that there are trade-offs between                     education and other worker qualifications, so that concern about                over-education may be misdirected.                                                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:  hosting           a symposium on the role of women in the economics profession;                   teaching a course in labor economics; hosting \"brown bag\"                       lunches; meeting individually with women students in economics;                 and presenting papers in seminars.",
