 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The Infant Study Center and Visual                 Research Lab in the Psychology Department at Brooklyn College to                continue a successful REU-SITE which offers students a research                 experience which focuses on many aspects of the visual system.                  Together with a colleague from Medgar-Evers College of CUNY,                    mentors will constitute a REU-Site aimed at students who might be               persuaded by their research experience to continue to the doctorate             in Experimental and Developmental Psychology, and related areas in              the Neurosciences.  Both institutions have many women and minority              students as well as special programs to attract and guide such                  students; heavy emphasis will be placed on recruiting among them.               The training program includes laboratory seminars, an active role               in a specific research \"team\", and public presentations of results.             The research areas are all heavily computerized and instrumented:               (i) Development of infants' abilities to focus their eyes on                    objects around them (i.e., mechanisms of accommodation and                      convergence); methods will include quantitative photorefraction.                (ii) Brain mechanisms associated with vision.  Visual evoked                    potentials will be recorded to examine the maturation of                        physiological systems, especially those involving the lateral                   interactions that are so important for object recognition.  (iii)               Color vision, particularly the use of scaling techniques to specify             color appearance under a variety of viewing conditions, such as                 changes in retinal position; results will be related to known                   variations in anatomy and physiology across the retina.",
