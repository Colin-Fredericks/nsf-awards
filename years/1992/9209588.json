 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant will enable Dr Angelika Rigos to                   initiate a research program studying the effect of hydrodynamic                 interactions on the behavior of colloidal suspensions. Many                     body hydrodynamic interactions will be included in model                        studies of hydrodymaic through the use of simulation methods.                   Much of the early work will entail making the simulations more                  efficient so that enough experimentation can be accomplished to                 determine realistic models to treat sheared colloidal                           suspensions. Subsequent work will entail validating the results                 through the comparison to experiment.                                           %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not yet                  received federal funding for their research. Dr. Rigos will be                  initiating a program which involves computer modelling and                      simulations on the very complex problem of the flow of                          colloidal suspensions. This work is of considerable importance                  to the understanding of the transport of materials in the                       environment.",
