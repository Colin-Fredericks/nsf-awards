 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Louis H. Pignolet of the                  Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, will investigate                 the synthesis, reactivity and characterization of heteronuclear                 cluster compounds containing platinum or palladium, and gold.                   New compounds that contain less than thirteen metal atoms and                   ligands such as isonitriles, alkyl phosphines, and halide ions                  will be synthesized.  In some cases a third metal, such as                      rhodium, osmium, or nickel, will also be introduced.  In                        addition, larger clusters containing more than thirteen metal                   atoms will be prepared.  Compounds will be characterized using                  some methods that that have not been exploited previously for                   clusters, including scanning tunneling microscopy and plasma                    desorption mass spectrometry.  Catalytic properties of the                      compounds will be tested, both under homogeneous and                            heterogeneous conditions.                                                       %%%                                                                             Discrete compounds containing a large number of metals and a                    mixture of metals are being investigated because of their                       potential catalytic applications.  They may serve as effective                  models for many commercial catalysts which are alloys, or                       mixtures of metals, or they may prove to be effective catalysts                 themselves.",
