 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses machine cutting of threads, a key                        step in reliably manufacturing many products.  The research                     intent is improving the process for enhanced accuracy.                          This will be accomplished by using nonlinear piezoactuators                     controlled by neural nets to obtain 5 arc minutes accuracy                      in positioning a cutting tool.  Specifically, in Phase I,                       neural networks will learn to control a highly nonlinear                        set of piezoactuators as simulated on a computer, whereas                       in Phase II, a machine tool will be instrumented to                             demonstrate the concept in hardware.  Tool positioning                          information will be supplied by a laser measurement device                      already available.  There are many types of metal cutting                       operations where this technology could be applied to reduce                     waste and improve quality.  The utility of the neural                           network is apparent since it can learn to compensate for                        many repeatable variables in the machining operation and                        also compensate for tool wear.",
