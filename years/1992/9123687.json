 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award continues               support for a highly successful mathematical activity at the                    University of Washington.  Ten students will receive support in                 each of the next three years.  They will work with two                          experienced faculty advisors on a broad range of questions                      generally classified as inverse problems. The problems involve                  both discrete and continuous environments with a decided slant                  toward physical applications.  In gaining insight to the                        problems, computer experimentation will play a major role.                           Students will investigate problems associated with the                     computation of values of conductors in a network, on discrete                   versions of inverse problems in magneto-telluric theory and in                  gravitational theory.  The fundamental issue is that of                         determining the conductivity throughout the interior of a                       conducting body from measurements of potential and currents on                  the surface.  Similar questions arise in attempts to determine                  the shape of a gravitational mass from measurements of                          gravitational potential on the surface.                                              Students will work in small teams and will submit papers on                their research at the end of the program.                                            The record of former students at this site is one of                       significant success. A number are pursuing graduate science                     degrees at outstanding U.S. institutions.  It is expected that                  this trend will continue.",
