 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tsunamis are ocean waves generated by an impulsive geophysical                  event, such as an earthquake.  Historically, Hawaii and Alaska                  have been the areas of the U.S. affected by tsunami impact.  The                objective of this research program is to study the runup of a                   tsunami onto a coastline, the overland flow of tsunamis, and                    their interaction with structures located in the nearshore                      regions.  Specifically, it is investigating:                                                                                                                         (1) The shape, kinematic characteristics and shoreward limit                        of propagation of the overland flow of the surge which                          may develop at the shoreline due to the tsunami.                                                                                                            (2) The determination of the forces and pressures imposed on                        two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures by an                          impinging surge.                                                                                                                                       This investigation is directed toward the mitigation of tsunami                 hazards by contributing to the knowledge needed:  to improve                    tsunami warning systems, to estimate the overland flow of a                     tsunami-induced surge, and to design structures located near the                shoreline which could be impacted by such a surge.",
