 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is and NSF-initiated planning workshop to determine             research problems in the area of facial expression understanding                that deserve future funding.   The main goals are (a) to identify               the most important areas of research on how to extract information              from facial activity relevant to a person\u001as emotional, cognitive                and physical state; (b) to enhance communication between man and                machine through the development of emerging computer vision capture             techniques for facial processing and categorization of facial                   expression; (c) to consider how we can facilitate the training of               new investigators in the relevant fields.  The workshop will                    produce a set of recommendations to the investigative community and             to  NSF to help guide funding opportunities.  There will be                     publications in standard journals of a report.The workshop                      participants represent a balance of researchers in the areas of                 facial expression understanding, computer vision and human computer             interaction.  Participants include researchers with NSF grants and              researchers in government and industrial laboratories.  The                     workshop will consist of plenary sessions and breakout groups                   focused on several research areas.  The steering committee includes             Dr. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco,                Dr. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana              and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute.",
