 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the infrastructure associated with education                     statistics, mathematics and science education, and research is                  imperative if we are to benefit from policy decisions that are                  informed by expert knowledge and reliable data.  Based on the                   experience from its current knowledge and reliable data.  Based on              the experience from its current NSF/NCES grant, AERA proposes a                 program of research and training designed to achieve two primary                objectives:  (a) to strengthen communications between scholars in               the educational research community and government administrators                and social scientists, and (b) to enhance the capability of the                 research community to conduct policy and practice relevant research             that shape NCES and NSF missions.                                                    The program will consist of seven components:  (a) a training              program to increase the educational research community's capacity               to work with NCES and NSF data sets; (b) a small grants competition             to increase policy and practice-related research using NCES data                sets, with a particular emphasis on mathematics and science data;               (c) a visiting Senior fellows program at each agency; (d) a                     research fellowship program at NCES and NSF that will allow newer               scholars to become involved in the design, analysis, and                        interpretation of data; (e) an annual think tank exercise to engage             in strategic planning; (f) a University based evaluation and                    dissemination traineeship program, and (g) an invisible academy of              highly technical researchers to undertake a sophisticated level of              basic, policy, and applied research on a relevant issue.",
