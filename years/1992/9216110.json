 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work planned in this mathematical sciences group                       research project seeks to combine two approaches to the problem                 of representing signals as expansions of discrete sets of                       functions.  One is through the Gabor transform, the other uses                  the wavelet expansion.  One of the primary goals of this research               is to combine the two approaches using a new technique called the               multiplicative Zak transform.  Applications of this work  will                  concentrate on characterizations of non-stationary signal.                      Algorithms will be developed to compute the coefficients of the                 resulting double series expansion and signal properties will be                 derived from the expansions.                                                         Since the multiplicative Zak transformation can be                         interpreted as the  Weil map.  It appears in another context                    within the representation theory of the Heisenberg group.  This                 theory provides insight into special function theory including                  theta functions and Krautchouk and Poisson-Charlier polynomials.                Applications to number theory are also planned.",
