 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Randall has developed a new cumulus cloud parameterization             that has been run in a research mode with the general circulation               model at Colorado State University.  Early results with this                    parameterization are quite promising.  Under this award, the                    parameterization will be tested in an operational environment using             the National Meteorological Center's (NMC) global forecast model.               Proper representation of cumulus clouds in numerical models is                  essential for improving weather prediction.  Cumulus clouds are                 important in releasing latent heat which drives the atmospheric                 circulation as well as playing a major role in the development and              evolution of thunderstorms and tropical cyclones.                                    The new scheme has many features which make it attractive for              both practical and scientific reasons.  Unlike its predecessor, the             Arakawa-Schubert parameterization, this version allows penetrative              cumulus clouds to form at any level in the model.  It also allows               for the formation of shallow cumulus cloud convective downdrafts.               The new scheme thus brings the numerical model closer to what is                observed in nature.  Computationally, the new scheme appears to be              superior in terms of simplicity and speed.                                           Forecasts with the new scheme will be compared with those made             with NMC's current cumulus scheme.  The principal investigator                  hopes to demonstrate the robustness and model independence of his               parameterization.                                                                    This project is being supported under the NSF-NMC Joint                    Program in Numerical Weather Prediction.",
