 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to support a two day symposium on \"Natural and                 Adaptive Immune Mechanisms in Insects\" at the 1991 Annual Meeting               of the American Society of Zoologists.  The symposium will be                   subdivided into three major sections:  cell mediuated immunity in               insects; humoral mediators of insect immunity; and suppressive                  agents of insect immunity.  This will be the first time that both               the inductive and suppressive sides of insect immunity will be                  discussed in a common forum in such a comprehensive manner.  The                contributors to the symposium are either established investigators              with prominent reputations in their respective fields, or young                 investigators who show great promise for the future.                                                                                                            The major goal of the symposium is to bring together investigators              who are sutdying different aspects of insect immunity, and provide              them with a unique opportunity to exchange ideas that will lead to              new interpretations of existing data and the development of new                 collaborations and approaches fo the future study of insect                     immunity.",
