 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student from Columbia University in Japan.  The                    project is to test a theory of gender relations in white collar                 organizations:  to assess the strength of cultural factors vs.                  organizational factors i explaining the discrimination against                  female workers in Japanese offices.  The student wil do                         participant observation in two Japanese business firms, one with                substantial numbersof women in professional positions and another               with few women in high level jobs.  By comparing behaviors,                     attitudes, life histories and professional aspirations of women                 in the two case studies the student will attempt to assess the                  importance of internal values against external organizational                   barriers to advancement.                                                                                                                                        This project is important because Japanese business seems                       monolithically efficient and production oriented as seen from the               US.  This sort of case study will provide valuable information on               local variation and on barriers to participation by women, which                will be useful in dealing with Japanese public and private                      organizations.",
