 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project starts from the premise that microeconomic units do                not adjust continuously to the information and shocks they                      perceive, and that when they do adjust their actions typically                  involve relatively large changes.  Recent literature has developed              both the microeconomic justification for such behavior and the                  implications of such an environment for aggregate dynamics.  This               project is mostly a continuation of the latter.                                                                                                                 The project has two parts.  The first provides methods for the                  empirical implementation of models of aggregate dynamics under                  heterogeneous and discontinuous microeconomic adjustment, and                   develops several applications.  On the methodological side, its                 purpose is to show (i) how to recover from aggregate data different             forms of microeconomic adjustment policies, (ii) the implications               of such policies for aggregate dynamics, (iii) the empirical                    relevance of these, and (iv) how to integrate microeconomic and                 aggregate data to improve the descriptive and predictive power of               aggregate dynamic models.  These techniques will be used to study               dynamic labor demands, price and wage dynamics, and business as                 well as residential investment.                                                                                                                                 The second part of the project is more specific and is aimed at                 studying the dynamic and medium run implications of the presence                of costs of creating new production units in a growing economy.                 The interaction between adjustment costs and growth yields a                    productive structure where heterogeneous units operate                          simultaneously, with continuous entry of new and efficient units                and scrapping of old and outdated ones.  The purpose of this part               of the project is to describe and study the efficiency of dynamic               unemployment and wage determination under this \"cleansing\" view of              both trends and cycles.  This apparatus will be used to study U.S.              and European business cycles, as well as the impact and optimal                 policy design in the face of structural reforms.",
