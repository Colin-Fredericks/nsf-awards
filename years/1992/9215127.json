 "awd_abstract_narration": "The springtime arctic troposphere has been shown to be a major             reservoir of many anthropogenically derived pollutants, including               nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.  Based on the available data, it              is estimated that the arctic troposphere contains roughly 10% of                the global tropospheric burden of NOy during spring.  Additionally,             tropospheric ozone concentrations are known to be increasing at                 about 1-2% per year during spring and summer at high latitudes.                 The springtime measurements of NO at Borrow, Alaska suggest that                photochemical activity and ozone production is possible during the              late spring period when NOy and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC's)               are still high, temperatures are warming, and solar intensity is                increasing.                                                                          In this study, the PI will further develop and validate                    instrumental capabilities for making measurements of the nitrogen               oxide species at low ambient mixing ratios.  Once validated, he                 will focus on gaining an improved understanding of the temporal                 distribution of NO, NO2 and NOy at Barrow during the spring-summer              transition period.  These measurements, along with J(NO2) and O3,               can then be used to calculate the O3 production rates and to                    evaluate the change in NOy speciation as a function of temperature              and solar intensity.",
