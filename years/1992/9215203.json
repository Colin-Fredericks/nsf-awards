 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a                     search will be conducted for evidence that there exists a                       regime of very large Reynolds numbers in which turbulence                       characteristics differ from those below this regime.  Both                      existing boundary layer turbulence measurements, and new data                   from a large Reynolds numbers fully developed pipe flow                         experiment to be built, will be searched for this evidence.                     Focus is on differences between the two conjectured regimes in                  the coupling of fluctuations very near the wall and those                       further out into the flow.                                                                                                                                      Discovery of changes in turbulence characteristics at very                      high Reynolds numbers would contradict the commonly held view                   that turbulence characteristics become more universal as                        Reynolds number increases.  This would impact the construction                  of predictive turbulence models and improve their accuracy and                  utility for various engineering systems.",
