 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Jochim and his                    colleagues will initiate a long term archaeological study of a 40               x 100 kilometer region which extends from the Danube River to the               Alps in Southern Germany.  In this first phase they will conduct                three projects.  First, they will synthesize the available site                 data for the period extending from the Aurignacian, ca. 35,000                  years ago, through the Neolithic period when agriculture and                    stock raising was introduced.  Material will be collated from                   museum collections and archaeological site reports.  Secondly,                  the team will develop a GIS data bank which includes information                on geomorphology and vegetation.  It will also incorporate data                 on archeological sites.  Finally, the group will conduct an                     archaeological survey of plowed fields in a subregion within this               broader area.  The results should provide detailed information on               both the archaeological sequence and the density of sites.                                                                                                      Archaeological work to date indicates that this region in                       Southern Germany contains a wealth of archaeological data with                  sites which extend from the early Upper Paleolithic through the                 Mesolithic and into Neolithic times.  Therefore, this region                    provides insight into how humans at a hunting and gathering level               of subsistence adapted to a harsh and highly variable Ice Age                   environment.  It also documents the change at the end of the Ice                Age to more temperate conditions as well as the succeeding shift                to a more settled Neolithic way of life.  However, the data are                 spotty and have never been analyzed within a single dichronic                   environmental perspective.  Therefore, it is difficult to                       understand the processes which underlay the human adaptation and                change. In this the first stage of a long term project, Dr.                     Jochim and his colleagues will establish the framework to make                  such a comprehensive analysis possible.                                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large number of archaeologists.  It will                  also increase our understanding of how humans adapt at a simple                 level of technology.",
