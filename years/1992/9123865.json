 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cognitive processes take time.  It takes a human at least half a                second to subtract \"1\" from a number and key in the answer, and                 subtracting \"2\" takes markedly longer.  The relationships among                 reaction times taken by different tasks can tell us details about               the way the underlying processes are organized.  This research will             develop further a particular method for discovering process                     organization through reaction times based on the mathematical                   theory of scheduling, a theory concerned with how best to organize              the processes involved in carrying out a task using a PERT (Program             Evaluation and Review Technique) network.  As the theory of                     scheduling is ordinarily used, one knows the way in which the                   processes are arranged in a PERT network and how long each one                  takes, and one wants to determine how much time will be required to             carry out the entire task under various conditions.  The cognitive              psychologist faces the inverse problem, knowing how long it takes               to carry out the task under various conditions, and wanting to                  infer the structure of the network and to estimate the time                     required for each process.                                                                                                                                      At this point, we know how this works in dual tasks, tasks in which             two stimuli are presented, each requiring a separate response.  It              seems to be the case that more than one perceptual process may be               executed at the same time, as may more than one movement-related                process, but processes such as deciding and remembering must go on              one at a time.  Because the latter processes demand attention, they             appear to use a central processor which carries out only one of                 them at a time.  Some of the experiments will investigate dual                  tasks, with an emphasis on learning about the order in which these              central processes are carried out.  Scheduling theory indicates                 that some orders are more optimal than others, and the experiments              will investigate whether subjects spontaneously use the optimal                 order, or can learn to do so with practice.  Using the optimal                  order would, of course, reduce reaction times.  Saving a few tenths             of a second or improving accuracy by a few percent would not make               much difference in everyday tasks, but might make a substantial                 future improvement in tasks such as air traffic control, in which               it may be possible to optimize the type of information people                   receive and the order in which they receive it.                                                                                                                 Other experiments will investigate the organization of mental                   processes when reading statements in the PASCAL computer language;              such statements need to be carefully read when debugging programs.              The most ambitious experiments will investigate the processing                  involved in recall from short-term memory.  When a list of items,               a phone number for example, is recalled immediately, a few items in             the middle are not so much recalled as reconstructed from the                   degraded fragments of the items that remain in memory.  By timing               subjects as the recall aloud, it is possible to study the processes             involved in such reconstruction.",
