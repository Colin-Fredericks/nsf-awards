 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inferences of evolutionary relationships in most groups of                 organisms have traditionally been based on morphological                        characters. In recent years, however, the use of molecular data                 has become widespread in systematics. Although there is usually                 close agreement between morphology-based and molecule-based                     inferences about phylogeny, there are special cases in which rates              of evolution in the two components differ greatly. This appears to              hold for salamanders of the tribe Hemidactyliini in the family                  Plethodontidae, in which morphological characters alone do not                  appear to provide a reliable estimate of phylogeny. Knowledge of                patterns of genetic divergence in this group (which may occur in                the absence of morphological differentiation) also has implications             for the conservation of these salamanders and their habitat,                    especially because some of the species involved are threatened by               habitat destruction.                                                                 Under the guidance of faculty advisor David Hillis, graduate               student Paul Chippindale will use several molecular systematic                  techniques to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among these                salamander species. The techniques include protein electrophoresis,             restriction enzyme analysis of nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial              DNA, and sequencing of mitochondrial genes. Special emphasis is                 placed on the surface and cave-dwelling central Texas salamanders               of the genera Eurycea and Typhlomolge, with a diversity of                      morphologies and of life histories.The research will determine                  whether parallel changes in morphology and in life history                      characterize this group, and it will also test hypotheses about the             evolutionary significance of changes in genome size.",
