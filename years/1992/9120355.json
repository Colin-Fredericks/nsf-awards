 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism and consequences of rapid  electron transfer                      reactions will be investigated using a picosecond laser flash                   photolysis system designed to record the absorption of                          transient intermediates on the order of a few picoseconds. The                  cycloaddition reactions to be investigated include: (1) the                     addition of olefins to stilbene; (2) the Paterno-Buchi reaction                 between benzophenone and a variety of alkenes and selected                      alkynes; and (3) an evaluation of the mechanism for                             photoreduction of aryl ketones with metal hydrides. All of the                  reactions to be investigated involve cycloaddition reactions                    which proceed via short lived intermediates.  In the context of                 the electron transfer processes which occur in these reactions,                 the crucial differences between contact and solvent separated                   ion-pairs will be clearly delineated for the first time.                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Kevin                 Peters at the University of Colorado will involve the study of                  very fast chemical reactions which are complete in less than a                  billionth of a second. Reactions called cycloadditions, which                   are promoted by the transfer and redistribution of electrons                    from one molecule to another, will be monitored by a laser                      system capable of recording the existence of short-lived                        intermediate species which only exist for a few trillionths of                  a second. The need to understand the properties of these                        transient species is critical to defining the role of electron                  transfer in a variety of reactions of importance in                             biological and technological processes.",
