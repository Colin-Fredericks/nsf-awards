 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique free electron laser (FEL) system,                                 tunable in the far-infrared (FIR) system portion                                of the electromagnetic spectrum will be acquired                                from AT&T Bell Laboratories and installed in                                    renovated laboratory space at Rutgers University.                               The instrument consists of a high current                                       microtron electron accelerator, an electron                                     beamline with quadruple and dipole magnets, a                                   helical undulator electromagnet, ancillary optics,                              optical devices and high vacuum equipment.                                      Laboratory renovation required for installation of                              the instrumentation consists primarily of the                                   excavation and masonry of an underground vault for                              radiation shielding of the FEL and modernization                                of existing laboratory space for a                                              multidisciplinary research program utilizing the                                system.                                                                              The FEL laboratory will be the major                                       scientific research facility of its type in the                                 eastern United States.  Research will be conducted                              in the fields of physics, chemistry, biophysics                                 and materials science.  Initial areas for study                                 include linear and nonlinear time resolved FIR                                  spectroscopy , relativistic electron physics, and                               advanced instrumentation development.  Specific                                 experiments planned include the study of                                        superconductors including high Tc materials and                                 Buckyball superconductors, compound semiconductors                              and devices, DNA and other important biological                                 molecules, and chemical kinetics.  Training of                                  undergraduate and graduate students will be                                     included in this facility.",
