 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed towards understanding how                             auditory information is processed and coded by nerve                            cells in the cochlear nucleus, a portion of the brain                           pathways that are involved in hearing.  The auditory                            environment provides a rich and complex array of                                information from a myriad of sounds from different                              sources.  Some of this information, such as speech sounds,                      is highly relevant to us, while much of it is disregarded                       as extraneous noise.  The auditory central nervous system                       converts auditory information into neural signals which                         are later analyzed at different levels in the brain.                                                                                                            In order to understand how auditory information                                 processing occurs, this research is being conducted to                          determine what aspects of auditory information are being                        coded by individual types of nerve cells in the cochlear                        nucleus as well as  where cochlear neurons send this                            information in the brain.  The activity of single nerve                         cells is recorded and analyzed using microelectrodes                            inserted into single neurons, the response to auditory                          stimulation is recorded, and a dye is injected into the                         nerve cell in order to identify it using histological                           techniques.  By locating and analyzing this labelled                            neuron using both light and electron microscopy, it is                          possible to answer a number of basic questions which                            include:  (1) Do certain types of cells encode specific                         parts of the auditory signal?  (2) What part of the brain                       do these cells relay information to?  (3) What are the                          interactions between individual types of neurons?  These                        studies are essential to understanding how such a complex                       sensory system provides us with the experience of hearing                       that is so crucial to perception and cognitive                                  experience.",
