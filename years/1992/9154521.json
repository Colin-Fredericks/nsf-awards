The final goal is to study the                                     three-dimensional distribution of pulmonary                                     blood flow using single photon emission                                         tomography (SPECT) which has been corrected                                     for attenuation effects and which has been                                      collected using respiratory gating                                              techniques.  During the planning grant the PI                                   will concentrate on constructing a                                              physical model of the pulmonary system,                                         developing algorithms for attenuation                                           correction and techniques for respiratory                                       gating and learning methods to manipulate                                       SPECT data.                                                                                                                                                     This project is very timely since it deals                                      with the analysis of 3-D image data.  The                                       proposal is well-written and the approaches                                     that will be used are justified.  The                                           preliminary studies should help develop a                                       competitive full-proposal in the field of                                       SPECT medical imaging.",
