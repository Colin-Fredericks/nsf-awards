This chinese language report was                                                prepared by the Institute of                                                    Engineering Mechanics in Harbin,                                                China which is the major research                                               institute on earthquake engineering                                             in China.  This magnitude 7.8                                                   earthquake leveled the city of                                                  Tangshan and killed 243,000 people,                                             and industries and city lifelines                                               suffered major disruption.  The                                                 city was composed mainly of                                                     structures that had not been                                                    designed for earthquake forces and                                              approximately 80% of the buildings                                              collapsed entirely or in part.                                                  Similar vulnerable cities exist in                                              the U.S. and also in Central and                                                South America, Italy, Greece,                                                   Turkey, Pakistan, India, and                                                    Indonesia.  When translated into                                                english, the report on the Tangshan                                             earthquake would be valuable to                                                 U.S. engineers, architects, and                                                 government officials in reducing                                                seismic vulnerability, and in                                                   addition would be valuable to many                                              developing countries.                                                                                                                                           The relevance of the report remains                                             high because the vulnerability of                                               most cities remains high.  It is                                                the purpose of the translation                                                  project to make available to U.S.                                               readers the information contained                                               in the report and thus to encourage                                             hazard mitigation measures.",
