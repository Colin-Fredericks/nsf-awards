 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to model the temporal evolution of the large-scale                 density structures of the plasmasphere as they are created and                  controlled by the dynamics of refilling and convection.  These                  structures are a prominent features appearing in measurements of                the plasmasphere and will be theoretically examined with a two-                 dimensional plasmaspheric model \u0131Rasmussen et al., 1990! patterned              after Chen and Wolf \u01311972!.  Our approach will be to parametrically             study plasmaspheric features created by a variety of temporally-                and spatially-varying electric fields and to compare these features             with recent measurements of the plasmasphere.  Areas of specific                interest are the two-dimensional structure of regions of relatively             dense plasma, which appear to be detached from the main body of the             plasmasphere when seen from the perspective of an orbiting                      satellite, as well as the creation of various characteristic                    plasmaspheric density profiles \u0131see Horwitz et al., 1990!.  This                modeling study is, in part, motivated by new observations of                    structures in the plasmasphere \u0131e.g., Carpenter et al., 1990;                   Horwitz et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1990!.",
