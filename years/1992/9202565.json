 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlined a program which will introduce chemical                  synthesis methods in the Ba-Ti-O system.  It will use an array of               characterization techniques to provide a molecular understanding of             the formation of Ba-Ti-O ceramics.   It will also correlate the                 microstructure and properties of sintered ceramic specimens                     prepared from these powders.  Effects of chemical composition,                  substitution, doping and impurities on the nucleation and growth                behavior of these precursors during decomposition will be examined              using thermal analysis techniques (DTA, TG, and EGA) and hot-stage              x-ray diffraction.  Paralle; electron energy loss spectroscopy                  (PEELS) will correlate these changes with small variations in                   chemical structure.  Electron diffraction will be used to identify              emerging, and possibly transient, phases.  Optical spectroscopy                 will investigate the mechanism of ceramic formation from the                    chemical matrix.  Low to very high frequency dielectric                         measurements will monitor the properties and  microstructures of                the ceramics.                                                                   %%%%                                                                            This project proposes to investigate the influence of the chemical              state on final products through a novel combination of analytical               techniques situated at the interface boundaries between chemistry               and ceramics.  Chemical and structural parameters will be evaluated             in the compounds existing in-between the chemical and the ceramic               states.  An array of techniques are used to investigate this                    problem.  This project can provide a molecular understanding of the             ceramic formation.  The Ba-Ti-O system is selected for study.                   Information from this project can reveal a great deal about the                 formation mechanisms.   This type of knowledge will lead directly               to improvements in the processing as well as in the new compounds.",
