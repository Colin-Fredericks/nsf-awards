Detailed data will be collected on the distribution, fruiting                   phenology and seed germination and seedling establishment                       requirements of two species of shrubby Melastomatacea and of                    Rubiaceae, both dominant families in the understory at the site.                                                                                                These data will be combined with dietary and behavioral data of                 three species of understory frugivorous birds into a model to                   quantify seedling establishment of each plant species as a result                                                                                               of dispersal by each bird species.  Populations of the four shrub                                                                                               species will be studied using standard measurement and phenology                                                                                                methods, and also through quantification of light environments by                                                                                               hemispherical canopy photographs and field germination and                      seedling                                                                        survival trials.  Bird populations will be studied by direct                    observation of color-banded birds, fecal sample analysis, and                   radio-tracking individuals of each species throughout the year.

Because of the difficulty or                      impossibility of following the fates of individual seeds                        dispersed                                                                       from an understory plant, this model will provide a powerful tool                                                                                               for quantifying interactions between understory plants and                      understory frugivorous birds, a species rich, but little                        understood                                                                      system .",
