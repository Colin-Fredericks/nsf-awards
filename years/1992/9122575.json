 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a fundamental study of alumina-supported, platinum-tin                  bimetallic, hydrocarbon reforming catalysts.  Model and real                    catalytic surfaces are studied, including platinized tin oxide                  films, tin-decorated platinum crystals, platinum/tin alloy                      surfaces, and platinum and/or tin deposited on planar alumina,                  planar carbon, or porous alumina.  Various surface analytical                   techniques are used, including X-ray photoelectron                              spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), ion                      scattering spectroscopy (ISS), electron energy loss                             spectroscopy (EELS), secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),                    electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and ultraviolet                           photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).  Catalytic reforming                          reactions are run at both low and high pressures using a                        reactor attached to the ultrahigh-vacuum characterization                       system.  Catalytic behavior is correlated with elements of                      catalyst structure as elucidated by the characterization                        studies.                                                                                                                                                        Bimetallic reforming catalysts, including the platinum/tin                      system studied in this project, are the principal technology                    enabling production of larger amounts of high-octane fuels                      from ever-decreasing quality grades of crude oil.  They also                    have an increasing role in environmental amelioration.                          Despite their great economic importance, they are still poorly                  understood.  The volumes and added value produced with these                    catalysts are such that even small improvements can have egret                  economic benefit. //",
