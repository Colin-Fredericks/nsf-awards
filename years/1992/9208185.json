 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, headed by Professor Emile Schweikert of                  Texas A&M University, and supported by the Analytical and                       Surface Chemistry Program, addresses questions of the analysis                  of solid materials using high energy ion projectiles and                        thermal neutrons.  Measurement of the kinetic energy of recoil                  nuclei will be used to develop a depth profiling method for the                 analysis of light elements in solids.  Time and spatial                         correlation counting of secondary ions, electrons, and photons                  generated by the collision of high energy polyatomic ions with                  surfaces will be used to study the basic processes of                           ion-surface interactions.  This work promises an increased                      understanding of the physical interactions underlying the use                   of ions and thermal neutrons for surface and solid state                        analytical applications.                                                        %%%                                                                             One of the outstanding problems in solid state materials                        analysis is the determination of the concentration of light                     elements as a function of distance from the surface of the                      solid sample.  This research project addresses this problem by                  developing an analytical technique which uses neutron induced                   reactions of the light element constituents and kinetic energy                  measurements of the recoil nuclei produced to obtain depth                      profiling information.  In addition, this project uses related                  experimental methods to investigate the details of the                          interaction of high energy polyatomic ions with surfaces, with                  a view towards the development of improved surface analytical                   methodology.  This work will have wide applicability in the                     analysis of the surface and bulk composition of materials                       important in the electronic device industry.",
