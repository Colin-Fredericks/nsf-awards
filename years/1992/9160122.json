Recent                                            research has shown that incorporation of                                        a low temperature buffer layer grown by                                         molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) can result                                         in many performance improvements,                                               including elimination of backgating.                                            Because of its very high processing cost,                                       MBE is not commercially viable production                                       method.  We propose to form an effect                                           buffer layer using ion implantation,                                            demonstrated manufacturable process.                                            One of the dominant characteristics of                                          the MBE-grown buffer layers is an excess                                        of As in the film.  Ion implantation is                                         well suited to simulate the MBE layers                                          since implantation conditions can be                                            tightly controlled to precisely engineer                                        the As profile by adjusting implantation                                        parameters such as dose, energy, and dose                                       rate.  Phase I work is to use ion                                               implantation to produce As-rich isolating                                       buffer layers in GaAs.  The structural                                          and electrical properties of the buffer                                         layers will be studied and compared to                                          those of MBE-grown layers.",
