 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has recently published the \"Global Ocean Surface                    Temperature Atlas\" (GOSTA) in conjunction with colleagues in the                U.K. Met. Office, which includes a compilation of sea surface                   temperature (SST) anomalies from January 1856 to December 1989                  (where available).  He proposes to check the corrections applied                to bucket temperatures before 1940, with help from the Woods Hole               Sea Educational Association Students who presently have buckets                 from the Met Office Museum at sea.  This will help to estimate                  potential errors when the data set is used to estimate long term                temperature changes. GOSTA data will be used together with                      surface energy fluxes from the Consolidated Ocean Atmosphere Data               Set (COADS) and microwave sounding unit (MSU) data on free air                  temperature to study the mechanisms of sea-air interaction and                  climatic fluctuations.  Example of such studies include:  the                   space-time structure of sea surface temperature fields, air                     temperature fields and surface flux fields; the correlations                    between these fields and between the fields and regional SST                    values; the association between latent heat flux variations and                 air temperature changes; estimation of the fraction of variance                 of marine air temperature changes attributable to atmospheric                   turbidity changes, Southern Oscillation Index changes and other                 changes involving atmospheric circulations; the relative                        importance of cloudiness changes, wind speed changes, sensible                  heat loss and latent heat loss in procuring SST anomalies.                      The research is important because it should add to our                          understanding of climate processes important to climate change                  and to our information base required to detect climate change.",
