 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete tandem (DT) production lines, such as transfer lines,             form the heart of critical industries such as the automobile                    industry, and are highly capital intensive.  This effort aims to                enhance the tools available for design optimization of DT lines.                The approach involves using simulations of continuous tandem (CT)               lines, where the product in the line is continuous fluid.  This has             the potential of resulting in more efficient simulations, and much              faster optimization schemes--with perhaps two orders of magnitude               reduction in CPU times when these two possibilities are combined.               The methodology involves:  (i) studying how to create accurate CT               representations of DT lines, (ii) devising fast optimization                    schemes for these CT simulations, and (iii) translating the results             to near-optimal DT line parameters.                                                 This research focuses on one configuration of a production                  line, it should make a fundamental contribution to the state-of-                the-art in manufacturing systems analysis.  It has the potential                to provide a richer set of tools for analysis of other types of                 discrete manufacturing systems.  It is expected that this research              will have a short term practical impact and a longer term                       theoretical impact.",
