Six                                   universities will participate: Auburn University;                               Alabama A&M University; University of Alabama,                                  Birmingham; University of Alabama, Huntsville; and                              University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.  The state's                                 research base will be strengthened by adding tenure-                            track positions in materials science and biology;                               conducting an Agency Visitation Program will improve                            proposal success rates by providing faculty travel                              funds for visits to federal program officers; and                               implementing an Instrumentation Matching Grant fund.                            In addition, The Alabama Technology Transfer Council                            will be established to develop improved relationships                           with the private sector.  Active participants in EPSCoR                         governance will include key university administrators,                          state government officers, and influential members of                           the private sector.  Over the three-year award period                           the State of Alabama and institutions will contribute                           $19 million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.",
