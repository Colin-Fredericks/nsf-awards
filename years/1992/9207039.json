 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent political events have begun to focus research on the                transformation of socialist economies.  Within socialist                        countries foreign direct investment is viewed as a vital                        component in economic development.  Yet, there is little                        understanding of the institutional basis which shapes the                       processes of foreign investment in a transforming command                       economic system.  Of concern is how different types of foreign                  investment interact with different segments of the decentralizing               economic system in socialist countries.  The phenomenon of                      Taiwanese investment in China since the mid-1980s provides an                   opportunity to empirically answer both sets of questions.  This                 project will examine the process of manufacturing                               decentralization from Taiwan to localities in Guandong and Fujian               Provinces of China, and it will assess the impacts of this                      activity on employment, industrial structure, levels of                         technology, living standards, and the generation of industrial                  linkages in both the capital export region in Taiwan and the                    capital import localities in China.  It will test the hypothesis                that under specified conditions foreign investors will establish                a dynamic production linkage with the local production system and               generate favorable regional impacts.  Data will come from                       published statistics and personal interviews with key actors.                   The research will develop a typology of firms, localities,                      investment linkages, and production linkages between the import                 and export regions.                                                                  This research addresses the basic issue of what local and                  regional consequences ensue from manufacturing capital outflows                 from newly industrializing economies to other developing areas.                 Does this phenomenon present an opportunity to promote economic                 cooperation or more intense competition.  The case of Taiwanese                 investment in China is important because of the strong ethnic and               social links between these two nations that are not present in                  other direct investment relations between capital exporting and                 capital importing economies.",
