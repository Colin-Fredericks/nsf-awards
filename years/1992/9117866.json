 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rainfall is produced by atmospheric processes which are highly             nonlinear and operate and interact at a wide range of scales.  One              of the main challenges to hydrologists, meteorologists and                      climatologists is to measure, model and predict the nature of the               extreme variability exhibited by rainfall at different scales.                  Recent research has indicated the exciting possibility that                     rainfall may exhibit scaling/multiscaling characteristics, i.e.,                small scale fluctuations are statistically similar to large scale               fluctuations except for one or more factors related to scale.  The              presence of such a hidden structure in the highly irregular                     patterns of rainfall at different scales will improve our                       understanding of the rainfall process and will significantly                    influence our approach to rainfall modeling, measurement and                    prediction.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a new              theoretical framework for identifying and studying the presence of              scale invariant relationships in remotely sensed rainfall.  Our                 approach, based on multiresolution wavelet analysis, is different               from contemporary approaches.  It is more general and has the major             advantage of being able to handle non-stationarity/inhomogeneity                and anisotropy efficiently, all of which are important                          characteristics of space-time rainfall fields.  Preliminary                     implementation of our approach to spatial rainfall has given very               promising results and has pointed out new directions for data                   analysis which have the potential of unraveling simple structures               from the complex non-homogenous anisotropic spatial rainfall                    fields.  Also, as part of this research, the possibility of using               scaling concepts for subgrid scale parametrization and resolution-              independent rainfall estimation, will be explored.",
