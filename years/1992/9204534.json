 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project encompasses research by four mathematicians and               their students on problems in homotopy theory.  Hopkins will study              classification questions in stable homotopy theory using tools from             p-adic number theory and localization.  Kan will continue research              into fundamental structures in homotopy theory connected with                   classification questions in unstable homotopy theory.  Peterson                 will study the Dickson algebra and other algebras as modules over               the Steenrod algebra.  Miller will study the structure of finite                loop spaces using cohomological methods.                                             Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of                   differential equations.  Over the intervening century it has                    evolved prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its own             and independent of its source.  Increasingly, however, it has begun             to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more important to             know of the solution of an equation whether it is a closed loop or              whether it is knotted, for example, than to know precisely and                  numerically what are the coordinates of all of its points.                      Furthermore, although the former qualitative information is                     implicitly contained in the latter complete description, it is not              at all obvious how to extract it.  The sophisticated machinery that             has been developed by topologists, such things as the                           investigations in homotopy theory outlined for this project, has                now been developed to a degree that often permits these natural                 problems to be handled in a natural way.",
