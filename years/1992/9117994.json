 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is an investigation of the present                   crustal tectonics and the evolution of the central California coast             ranges in the San Francisco Bay region, where the San Andreas fault             system splays eastward through a complex of successive bifurcations             into the Calaveras, Hayward and Greenville faults, a process                    readily visible in the seismicity maps of the area.  Competing                  hypotheses for crustal accommodation of the plate boundary motion               will be tested.  Evidence will be sought on the compelling modern               paradigm for the crustal dynamics of this system, in which upper                crustal blocks along with their bounding faults move eastward,                  above a mid-crustal decollement, creating the regional complex of               east- and west-vergent thrust faults, tectonic wedges and fold                  belts.  The proposed research is an integrated investigation of the             crust's third dimension eastward from San Francisco Bay to the                  western boundary of the Great Valley.  Modern seismological methods             and geological/geodetic constraints will be combined in the study.              Reflection seismic profiles, natural-event P- and S-wave                        tomography, ongoing geological studies of East Bay faults, and new              data on crustal deformation in the Bay Area will be interpreted                 jointly within a common geometrical framework for the plate                     boundary in central California.  Reflection data are key to this                study, and a primary focus in this project.  160 km of high-                    quality industry \"spec\" data in the area are available for purchase             and can be reprocessed for deeper imaging.  The new BASIX (Bay Area             Seismic Imaging eXperiment) marine/land profile, shot in the Bay,               River and offshore waters with USGS support in September 1991,                  provides additional valuable coverage of the region, and the data               are in hand at Berkeley.",
