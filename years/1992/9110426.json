 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase II proposal addresses research on III-V                              semiconductor materials grown heteroepitaxially on                              silicon (Si).  The feasibility of the proposed                                  approach was demonstrated in Phase I (Award No.                                 ISI-8861448, during which Kopin evaluated lasers                                formed in GaAs grown heteroepitaxially on Si by                                 organometallic chemical vapor deposition.                                       Although the approach was found feasible, the                                   Phase I work also demonstrated the need for                                     further reduction in the defect density of the                                  heteroepitaxial GaAs films; thus, the objective of                              the proposed Phase II research is the attainment of                             an improved understanding of growth mechanisms                                  that can be applied to reduce the deleterious effects                           of dislocations arising from the lattice mismatch.                              To more fully address the fundamental aspects of                                this research problem, we propose a collaborative                               program involving the University of Florida.  By                                with a high h level of characterization effort, we will                         develop an improved understanding of the materials                              and growth processes, leading ultimately to defect                              densities on the order of 104 cm -2.",
