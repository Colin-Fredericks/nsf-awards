 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrate reductase is a central enzyme in plant metabolism.  The PI              will investigate the biochemistry of the flavin adenine                         dinucleotide (FAD) domain and the combined cytochrome b/FAD super-              domain of corn NADH:nitrate reductase by expressing them as                     recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli.  The FAD domain has                   already been expressed; it is similar to holo-nitrate reductase in              biochemical and immunochemical properties.  Crystals of the                     recombinant FAD domain, which diffract x-rays have recently been                obtained by collaborators in Sweden and analysis of its 3-D                     structure is underways.  Based on the structural model being                    derived, he will construct site-directed mutants of residues                    involved in binding FAD and NADH.  The cytochrome b/FAD super-                  domain, which is expected to catalyze NADH-dependent cytochrome c               reduction, will be expressed in E. coli, purified and                           characterized.  Purified recombinant super-domain will be supplied              to Professor Branden's group in Sweden for crystallization.  Site-              directed mutagenesis will also be done on this recombinant nitrate              reductase fragment.  These studies will provide new information on              functional and structural properties of nitrate reductase and may               be useful for gaining insight into cellular mechanisms involved in              regulation of the enzyme's activity.                                            %%%                                                                             The structural and functional properties of corn nitrate reductase              will be investigated by expressing portions of the enzyme in an E.              coli system.  Such expression will allow production of sufficient               quantities of the enzyme's catalytic domains to allow                           crystallization.  Crystals of the domains will be used in X-ray                 diffraction studies to determine the three dimensional structure of             the functional protein.  These experiments should provide                       significant new insights into electron transfer properties of the               enzyme which are essential to its function in nitrate reduction.",
