 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies of primate evolution have demonstrated that                    certain aspects of evolution, ecology, and behavior have a direct               impact on the size and shape of the bony and muscular elements of               the skeleton.  However, the relationships are not always clear, nor             are the correlations the same across different primate groups.                  Several specific determinants of form have been identified, such as             diet and foraging behavior, size and orientation of branches used               in the natural habitat, locomotor movements and postures, body                  size, and evolutionary history of the lineage.  The goal of this                study is to correlate skeletal and muscular anatomy with these key              determinants of form in eleven species of poorly-understood and                 highly endangered group of South American monkeys.                                                                                                              Specific measurements and descriptions of the bones and                         musculature of all four limbs in each of the eleven monkey species              will be taken.  Such data will also be collected in a group of                  eight additional primates, sharing ecological and behavioral                    similarities with the monkeys, to be used for comparative purposes.             Details of the behavior and ecology of each monkey species and                  members of the comparative group will be taken from published                   field studies and films of several monkeys in captivity.  The                   anatomical data will be analyzed for its functional  significance,              determining the movement capabilities of each limb joint, and then              will be statistically correlated with the behavioral data for each              species.                                                                                                                                                        This integrated approach will provide a comprehensive understanding             of the functional anatomy of an important group of                              South American monkeys.  It will also serve as a rigorous test of               several previous suggestions of anatomy/behavior correlations and               will address numerous broader issues in primate anatomy and                     evolution.",
