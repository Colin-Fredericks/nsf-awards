 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves geothermal research with two holes that              will be drilled in Moat-fill units in the Creede Mining District                in Colorado in the fall of 1991.  The objectives of the research                are to obtain excellent temperature-depth data, reliable heat flow              values (Q), uranium (U), thorium (Th) and potassium (K)                         concentration data, and radiogenic heat production data (A) for                 both locales.  From the temperature-depth data, hydrologic                      phenomena in the environs of the holes can be studied, as may be                the fracture systems that are receiving and yielding subsurface                 fluids.  The vertical distributions of U, Th, K and radiogenic heat             production also will be used to infer present and past movement of              fluids and radioisotopes in the Moat-fill units, and will provide               insight into relations between radioactive heat and hydrothermal                activity near both stations.  Considered with Q and A data that                 exist for mining company holes in the District to the north, the                heat flow and heat production values for the holes in the Moat will             yield reliable estimates for heat sources and temperatures at                   depths greater than 1 km in the Creede Hydrothermal System,                     information that must be known for future deep drilling in this                 classic mining area.",
