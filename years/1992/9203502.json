 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the study of effective and robust                strategies for the solution of large linear systems that arise                  from the discretization of elliptic boundary value problems.                    Major emphasis will be on the solution of non-self-adjoint,                     indefinite problems, e.g., the exterior Helmholtz problem.  Both                preconditioning strategies and computational strategies on                      parallel machines will be investigated.  In the area of                         preconditioning strategies, the objective will be the derivation                of estimates of condition numbers as well as the distribution of                eigenvalues and singular values of the preconditioned systems.                  The preconditioning of pseudospectral discretizations by finite                 difference or finite element discretizations will also be                       studied.  In the area of computational strategies, the                          effectiveness and implementation of various preconditioning                     strategies on SIMD and MIMD computer systems will be studied.                        In solving boundary value problems for elliptic equations                  numerically, it becomes necessary to solve the very large systems               of linear equations that arise when the continuous problem is                   replaced with a discrete problem.  The principal investigator                   will develop numerical methods that are both efficient and robust               for solving such systems.",
