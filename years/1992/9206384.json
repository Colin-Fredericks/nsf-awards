Adhesion's pervasive role in                                                                                                  areas as diverse as structural materials, biomaterials,                         membranes, and protective coatings, to name only a few, has                     come to be widely appreciated in recent years.  The interest                    in adhesion as a science has been spurred by two developments.                                                                                                  One has been the growth in techniques to manipulate surfaces                    and interfaces in multiphase materials systems, with                            significant improvement in the overall behavior of such                         systems.  The other has been the rapid progress in molecular                    and atomic level characterization of surfaces and interfaces.                                                                                                   Still being developed is a thorough understanding of how                        molecular or atomic level details at the interface between the                                                                                                  adhering phases are related to the macroscopic performance                      characteristics.  Correspondingly, the construction of a                        complete and general theory of adhesion is still in process.                    To achieve this goal, several scientists need to exchange not                   only results, but ideas.  They need to challenge each other,                    teach each other, and develop insights from one another.  This                                                                                                  can be best accomplished by an extended period of personal                      interaction.  The Gordon Conference, providing a week of close                                                                                                  contact among scientists, is one of the few venues that                         provides the required face-to-face interaction.",
