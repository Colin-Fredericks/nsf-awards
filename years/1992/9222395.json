 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator was previously funded by NSF/ATM to                  initiate an experimental science education project in the Bronx                 public school system.  The project is entitled the District Eleven              Weather Study Program (DEWS).  Its primary object is to demonstrate             that when fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students are given the               opportunity to participate in highly-motivational activities in                 weather study, they will acquire skills in basic scientific                     procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and a              greater awareness of career opportunities in the sciences,                      especially in meteorology.  The DEWS program is a successful                    activity within the Bronx public school system and has required                 only intermitted and nominal NSF support.  Recent events prompted               the principal investigator to request additional support from NSF               under a new proposal.  The support under thiss award will be used               to partially cover the increased cost of weather data received                  under the UNIDATA contract with Zephyr Weather Information Service,             Inc.;",
