This program is designed to train television                 weathercasters through on-campus and off-campus courses.                             The PC-McIDAS work stations will receive weather charts and                imagery via satellite and ingest, store, loop, analyze, and print               the requested data.  Broadcast Meteorology Program faculty and                  students will utilize the data in both the classroom and laboratory             settings for on-campus students and in video tape format for off-               campus students.  Undergraduate and graduate meteorology courses                and special meteorology courses for secondary education students                will utilize the data.  The current array of research being                     conducted by both faculty and students will increase with the new               work stations and the ability to create local weather forecasts                 will expand.                                                                         The weather graphics in the PC-McIDAS will also be transmitted             to the Universities' mainframe and then sent to other terminals                 across campus through the Ethernet communication system, allowing               a continuous monitoring of the current weather activity.  Weather               data and information will also be exchanged between MSU and other               meteorological universities through the internet system.",
