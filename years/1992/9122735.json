 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do some new technologies \"catch on\" rapidly in one place but                not another?  Economic and technological infrastructures of                     different localities may make a difference, but the managerial                  behavior of the agents of innovation is also relevant, as they                  contend with varying local social and political circumstances.                  For a proper understanding of the development of new technologies               in the United States, it is critical that these differing factors               be sorted out.   Dr. Cooper is studying in detail a specific case               to help answer these questions.  She is examining the effect of                 American patent management on adoption of the eventually                        predominant wood-planning machine during its patent period of                   1828-1856, in five different regions of the United States.  She                 is gathering original Woodworth planer patent assignment and                    litigation records to compare characteristics of competing                      planing methods and the circumstances of early and peaceful                     adoption with those of late and contentious adoption in New                     England, New York, Mid-Atlantic, Mid-West and Southern regions.                 The reputedly \"odious\" behavior of Woodworth planer assignees                   provoked a nationwide campaign to kill the twice-extended patent.               Dr. Cooper is analyzing the campaign's petitions to Congress in                 order to identify the interest groups opposing and supporting the               planer patent in the various localities.  Her study should                      improve our understanding of how the patent system functioned in                spreading innovations during the great period of                                industrialization of production in the United States.",
