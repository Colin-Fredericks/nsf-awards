 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moy will continue his joint work with Barbasch investigating               the unitary dual of a reductive p-adic group and will investigate               with Hales certain ways to establish what is called a uniform                   germ expansion for orbital integrals.  The research in unitarity,               with a goal of classifying all unitary representations, will be                 to investigate certain basic representations called unipotent                   representations.  The investigations in uniform germ expansions                 will be to find a way for determining whether two spaces of                     distributions are equal.                                                             The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
