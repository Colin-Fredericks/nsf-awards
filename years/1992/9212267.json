 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research provides a bridge between traditional analyses of                 simple conditioning and the study of more complex cognitive and                 organizational processes in behavior.  Previous research has                    yielded a set of procedures and phenomena that capture many of                  the more cognitive aspects of learning while building on the                    simplicity of simple conditioning.  In simple conditioning, an                  insignificant event, the conditioned stimulus (CS), comes to                    control behavior as the result of the formation of connections                  between neural representations of that CS and of another,                       biologically significant event, the unconditioned stimulus (US).                Under some circumstances, an event acquires the ability to                      modulate the effectiveness of connections among other events.                   Although this modulatory process (called occasion-setting) is                   based on simple conditioning, it is functionally distinct, and in               some cases follows different rules.  This occasion-setting                      process has much in common, both neurally and behaviorally, with                more complex memory phenomena studied by neuropsychologists.                                                                                                    The present research uses a variety of conditional-discrimination               tasks (those in which a CS signals one event in one circumstance                but another event in another circumstance) to (1) more precisely                specify the conditions under which occasion-setting occurs,                     including the development of mathematical models, (2) further                   explore what organisms actually learn about in conditional-                     discrimination tasks in which occasion-setting has been                         implicated, (3) examine the relation between simple Pavlovian                   conditioning (in which the CS signals the occurrence or                         nonoccurrence of the US), occasion-setting (in which an occasion-               setter signals the validity of a relation between another CS and                the US), and operant conditioning (in which a CS indicates when                 particular behavior will produce the US).                                                                                                                       The existence of occasion-setting suggests that important changes               and expansions to our current theories of conditioning are in                   order.  Those changes may well lead to a more profitable                        integration of relatively well-understood but simple conditioning               phenomena and more complex but poorly understood phenomena of                   cognition.  Furthermore, given the popularity of conditioning-                  based theories of phobias, eating disorders, substance abuse, and               other socially-significant phenomena that are surely under                      conditional or contextual control (and hence more analogous to                  occasion-setting than to simple conditioning), it is important to               understand the differences in the actions of simple conditioned                 stimuli and occasion-setters.",
