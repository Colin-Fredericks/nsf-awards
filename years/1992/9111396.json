 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is to conduct and analyze two specific                        experiments using the newly assembled Collisionless Terrella                    Experiment (CTX).  The results from these experiments  will                     significantly expand our understanding of collisionless particle                transport in planetary magnetospheres.  They will be used to test               basic theories of chaos and transport induced by dynamic and                    static non-axisymmetric perturbations to a dipole magnetic field.               For the first experiment, energetic electrons trapped within the                dipole magnetic field will be generated by operating our                        microwave plasma source so as to directly heat the high-field                   regions of the dipole.  As seen elsewhere, these electrons will                 become unstable to a spectrum of low-frequency interchange                      instabilities and induce collisionless radial transport.  We will               measure the amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the                         fluctuations, the condition for the onset of chaos, and the                     magnitude of the resulting transport.  We will also be able to                  observe marginally-stable pressure profiles and test theories of                adiabatic transport.  For the second experiment, we will impose a               multipolar static perturbation to the energetic electron plasma                 breaking azimuthal symmetry and destroying conservation of                      angular momentum.  By measuring the decrease in the confinement                 of the trapped electrons as the magnitude of the perturbation is                increased, we will be able to document the conditions leading to                three-dimensional chaos.  These experiments will be guided and                  interpreted by numerical and theoretical analysis.  By making                   correlations between laboratory and numerical simulations, we                   will demonstrate how magnetic fluctuations can induce transport                 and heating of energetic particles in dipole fields and establish               models for similar processes occurring in planetary                             magnetospheres.",
