 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with how people learn about, use, and                 update their concepts and categories.  Categorization is                        fundamental to reasoning, because human language and thought is                 made up of and organized around concepts.  A particular focus of                the project is to understand more fully how previous knowledge                  and experience are integrated with new information to determine                 concepts.  For example, much of science education involves                      learning new terms and concepts, and there is considerable                      evidence that previous knowledge sometimes leads to                             misconceptions and misinterpretations of new information.  In                   other cases, prior knowledge is unambiguously helpful.  Clearly                 we need to know much more about how knowledge and experience                    combine to determine what is learned.                                                                                                                           The research project has several distinct aims.  One goal is to                 evaluate what makes some categories easy and natural to learn and               what makes other categories unnatural and difficult to learn.  A                related goal is to develop further and to test quantitative and                 computational models of category learning.  One set of studies                  will evaluate these models in contexts where the learning                       examples have a complex, hierarchical structure.  A second line                 of work will study the effects of different perspectives on the                 perceived depth or centrality of different properties of                        concepts.  A third set of experiments will study how abstract                   advice or theories is combined with concrete examples in category               learning.                                                                                                                                                       The category descriptions associated with theories (or diagnostic               criteria in psychodiagnostic classification) are often much more                abstract than the properties or behaviors of individual instances               of a category.  The overall goal of the project is to understand                how these abstract knowledge sturctures become linked with                      specific, contextualized experience to determine concept                        formation.  Potential applications of this work range from                      science education to any of a number of situations where                        diagnostic classification is an important activity.",
