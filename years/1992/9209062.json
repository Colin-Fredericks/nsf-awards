The                aim of this conference is to proved a forum in which experts from               both the academic and industrial sectors, including new researchers             and students, can gather to interact.  This will afford them an                 opportunity to gain first hand knowledge of the scope, direction,               and future prospects of informatics and computing in complex genome             analysis.  The interdisciplinary nature of the conference is                    designed to foster an exchange of ideas and information among                   disciplines and to lead to a transfer of technologies, especially               from the academic sector to industry.  The focus of the conference              will be on the computational and experimental aspects of complex                biological molecular analysis. The subject areas cover databases                and languages, computer techniques for analysis of data (e.g.                   neural-net, pattern recognition), computer modeling and graphics                visualization, and experimental approaches such as mapping and                  cloning.",
