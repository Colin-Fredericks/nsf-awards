 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project makes use of recent ideas in theoretical physics,             such as gauge theory and topological quantum field theories, to                 study the topology of low-dimensional manifolds.  Topics to be                  considered include (1) Floer homology and 4-manifold invariants,                (2) magnetic monopoles and polynomial invariants for 3-manifolds,               (3) topology and symmetric hyperbolic equations, (4) the geometry               of magnetic monopoles.                                                               There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                      themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                      enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 4-manifolds which figure in this project fits this                pattern.  Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems of                  quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric construction.              The construction led in turn to an invariant that depended only on              the topological character and not the full geometric character of               the underlying manifold.  There are now variations on the original              construction and numerous resulting quantum invariants.  Their                  origin is sufficiently different from that of other previously                  known invariants that they can be expected to detect things the                 traditional invariants cannot, but it behooves topologists to                   demonstrate this explicitly, as well as to sort out the different               quantum invariants and their relationships to more traditional                  invariants.",
