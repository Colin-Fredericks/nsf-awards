 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost one-quarter of living mammal species are bats --                    members of the order Chiroptera.  Bats play a variety of important              ecological roles.  Many bat species prey on nocturnal insects,                  while others are essential to the pollination of flowering plants.              Increasing human impact on bat populations and species has serious              implications for agriculture and insect pest management.  Despite               many previous studies, there is still little agreement among                    biologists concerning relationships among higher-level bat groups               (e.g., genera and families).  Without such knowledge, it is                     difficult to interpret the wide ranges of variation in wing                     architecture, sonar capabilities, and ecology seen in different                 bats.  A clear understanding of bat diversity -- important for                  setting conservation priorities -- depends upon resolving the                   relationships (phylogeny) of bats.                                                   In this study, the problem of bat relationships will be                    addressed through a detailed analysis of the anatomy of the                     skeleton (excluding the cranium) and the muscles of a wide variety              of bats.  Recent bats will be studied using dried skeletons, muscle             dissections, and cleared and stained specimens.  Fossil bats will               be studied by direct observation and x-ray analysis.  The object                of these studies will be to identify similarities and differences               in anatomical structure that can be used to evaluate relationships.             Data collected in this study will be employed in a variety of                   computer-assisted analyses designed to produce testable hypotheses              of relationships within and among families of bats.  The                        relationships of bats to other mammalian groups (such as Primates)              will also be investigated.  In conjunction with data from molecular             studies and previous surveys of other anatomical systems, this                  study should provide a new framework for understanding the                      structural design, behavior, and ecology of bats.",
