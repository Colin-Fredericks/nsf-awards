Dr Leurgans will continue her work on the                    development of statistical methodology.  In particular she will                 work on multilinear models and multivariate responses.  Her work                is collaborative with scientists and engineers, and the work will               be highly computational.                                                             The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality                of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                  potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                 research, the academic profession, and the education of future                  scientists.  Dr. Leurgans will continue her work on the                         development of statistical methodology to answer questions in                   science and engineering.  Particularly noteworthy are her effort                to increase the size and quality of the graduate program in her                 department and her leadership as a role model to the other women                faculty in her department.",
