 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Department of Biological                     Sciences at Wellesley College to continue a successful summer                   undergraduate research program.  Participants will be selected from             junior Biology, Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who                have serious purpose and definite interest in independent work,                 have sufficient course preparation and have shown ability to think              imaginatively and independently.  Participants will be selected by              the project director and faculty committee after evaluation of                  applications forms designed to recruit the best qualified students              for particular projects.  The student will participate in all                   aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature review to              carrying out experimental procedures and observations, continuing               in analysis of data and determination of conclusions.  The students             will formally and informally discuss the work with the advisor, and             also will prepare discussions with all fellow participants, both                student and faculty, for weekly group seminars.  This will                      encourage both experience with oral presentations and exposure to               suggestions and criticism of other researchers.  Research reports               at the end of the program will involve a written paper, a poster,               and colloquia presentations to students and faculty during the next             academic year.  Throughout the summer, seminars will be presented               by women scientists in research careers in academia, industry and               medicine; field trips to biotechnology and chemical companies will              be taken.",
