 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooper Union's Department of Electrical Engineering will                        establish an undergraduate Computer Networking Laboratory with                  the primary goal of studying multimedia (data/voice/image)                      communications, inter-network connectivity, and network                         management.  To strengthen the Department's traditional                         emphasis on open-ended practical design projects, the facility                  will be used primarily as a testbed for implementing and                        testing innovative hardware/software design projects in several                 undergraduate courses. In addition, the laboratory will be used                 for hands-on demonstrations accompanying class lectures in the                  communications courses and others.The plan calls for a PC-based                 16 Mbps Token-ring local area network (LAN) with voice and                      image capabilities, an X.25 node interfacing to the LAN, and                    several measurement/test instruments.  Student projects will                    emphasize the design and implementation of interfaces, signal                   processing, and protocols to support multimedia services on the                 LAN, interconnection of the LAN to the X.25 node and other                      systems, and management/monitoring of the networks.",
