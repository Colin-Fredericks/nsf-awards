 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complete understanding of the internal motions of the molecular               and atomic components of biologically significant sequences of DNA              is the long-term objective to which the proposed work would                     contribute.  Such an knowledge would bear directly on the detailed              understanding of the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions.  The                 work proposed here would add to establishing a                                  dynamics-function paradigm.                                                                                                                                     Specifically, it is proposed to: (a) perform far-infrared                       measurements in order to determine how: sequence, length, and both              physiological and genotoxic counterions affect the long wavelength              vibrations of oligonucleotides, and (b) carry out a program                     to observe the effects of H-bond melting on biologically relevant               low frequency vibrations of various oligonucleotides.  Similar                  samples have been studied in the middle infrared and far-infrared               measurements have been made on some random polynucleotide                       sequences.                                                                                                                                                      Resources for accomplishing these tasks are uniquely available for              an undergraduate institution.  Senior thesis students will make                 measurements with the on-campus research-level Fourier transform                infrared spectrometer.  They will also purify large quantities of               oligonucleotides produced at a neighboring research laboratory.",
