 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Gary Wright, MS Penelope Drooker will                collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will try to                     understand the effects of early indirect contact between European               colonists and Native Americans in the midwestern United States                  and will focus on the analysis of materials excavated from two                  Ohio archaeological sites. The Madisonville village/cemetary in                 Hamilton County, Ohio dates to the early contact period and                     contains some 1400 burials within the same area as almost 1000                  storage pits.                                                                                                                                                   It yielded several hundred European-derived metal and glass                     artifacts. Excavated primarily over a period of three decades at                the turn of the century, it is the most populous and most                       completely excavated protohistoric site of the Fort Ancient                     culture. It probably spans the period from 15th to 17th                         centuries. MS Drooker will also examine a nearly site, Hahn's                   Field which is very similar but slightly earlier in time. No                    European derived artifacts were recovered and thus the two sites                taken together span the pre-contact to early-contact period. MS                 Drooker will visit museums which curate the relevant materials                  and study these remains. She will integrate all available data -                documentation, maps, artifacts and human remains - into a cross-                referenced computer data base so that spatial relationships can                 be determined. She will clarify the chronoloigcal relationships                 and analyze early and late components to establish baseline                     social characteristics and exchange relationships. She will                     attempt to determine how these changed over time. Finally she                   will evaluate the results to obtain a better understanding of                   intra- and inter-regional interaction and change during the early               contact period in eastern North-America.                                                                                                                        While it is clear in the long run that Native American cultures                 were destroyed in the colonization process, it is less often                    realized that, in some areas at least, an interactive process                   took place in which Native American groups adapted in a positive                way to European influence and integrated new elements into their                own culture. Areas such as the midwest where direct contact was                 relatively late provide an excellent context in which to study                  this process. The two Fort Ancient sites are unique because they                provide a large data base which include both mortuary and                       cultural remains. In particular they offer material which allow                 MS. Drooker to study changes in social organization, especially                 social stratification, over time.                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new                light on the American past. It will increase our understanding of               the general processes which underly culture contact and change,                 and will assist in the training of an extremely promising                       scientist.",
