 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the product life cycles become shorter, and the product                 variety increases, it has become crucial to minimize the lag period             between the start of a product's design and the time it is                      manufactured.  It is also crucial to be able to produce products                in small to medium quantities in a cost effective manner with high              quality.  The objectives of this project are to develop a                       qualitative model of geometry and structure, a new case-based                   method for construction of manufacturing process plans for three                dimensional objects, and new representation and reasoning methods               for recognition of features and modeling of features defined by the             users.                                                                               Investigation will be performed and a computer based                       environment for integrated issues will be developed.  The computer              based system will be tested on different sets of components, and                will be used to assess the capabilities and limitations of the                  underlying models.                                                               ***",
