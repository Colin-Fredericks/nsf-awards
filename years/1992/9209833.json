 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is twofold:  to investigate the                    power of counting solutions to computational problems, and to                   determine the properties shared by the typical languages in a                   complexity class.  Counting has been shown to be much harder                    than once thought, and deep connections have been drawn                         between the algebraic properties of counting classes and their                  computational difficulty.  The goal is to resolve the                           structural relationships between counting classes and to show                   that, although each solution to a problem is easily                             verifiable, counting number of solutions is inherently                          difficult.                                                                                                                                                      Adapting the analytic notions of measure and category to                        complexity theory has yielded new techniques to study the                       internal structure of a complexity class.  Various properties                   can be classified as either 'typical' or 'exceptional' for                      languages in the class, giving an overall qualitative picture                   of the class, and providing insight into the relative                           difficulties of computational problems.  These new techniques,                  and their relation to pseudorandom sequences, will be                           investigated.*** //",
