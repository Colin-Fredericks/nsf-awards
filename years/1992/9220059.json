 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, considerable experience has accumulated in                using the tools of national research management, including                      strategic planning, technology assessment, and performance                      evaluation. As an essential element of this set, retrospective                  research assessment at the program level, has received increasing               attention among decision makers and managers in most industrialized             nations--except perhaps the United States.                                                                                                                      Research assessment is  likely to be of greater interest in the                 United States in the years ahead and this project will provide a                systematic overview of past assessment studies, plus an examination             of the uses to which past assessment results have been put.  The                project will proceed in two phases: first, a codification of                    approaches taken in past studies, and second, an evaluation of                  those approaches with suggestions for improvement to fit the U.S.               context.  The second stage will culminate in a colloquium, to be                held in Washington, D.C., involving decision makers, analysts,                  research managers, and assessment experts.",
