 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for a workshop to access                    current state-of-the-art schemes for implementation of high-                    performance parallel machines.  For large high-speed parallel                   systems, the problems facing the computer designer must be                      addressed from both the architecture and the interconnection                    perspective.  Machine and packaging engineers must work in concert              in order to identify and solve the issues pertaining to clock                   distribution, routing, and partitioning before the hardware layout              is done.  The effects of interconnects and packaging on parallelism             and clock speed are evaluated.  Also, the workshop addresses                    subjects related to board, chip area constraints, signal                        degradation, electromagnetic modeling and simulation of                         interconnects, CAD simulation, optical computing, and their effect              on machine performance.  Workshop areas include microelectronics                packaging, optoelectronics, machine architecture, processor design,             VLSI, and CAD with topics grouped into one of three areas:  (1)                 Electronics Packaging and Interconnects; (2) Optoelectronics and                Optical Technologies; (3) Machine Architecture.",
