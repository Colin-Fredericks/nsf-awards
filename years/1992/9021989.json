 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of adjusting, or correcting,                the analytical model of a structure to agree with experimentally                measured data.  Typically, in vibration modeling, models                        determined analytically (i.e., by the finite element analysis                   (FEA) method) are compared with experimental modal analysis (EMA)               data.  Numerous incompatibilities generally exist between the                   analytical models and the experimentally obtained data, and the                 view is taken that the analytical model is in error and must be                 refined and corrected based on the experimental data.  This                     research recognizes that the model correction problem is similar                to the statement of the eigenstructure assignment problem and                   pole placement problem common to control theory.  The intent here               is to utilize the control theory algorithms to solve the model                  correction problem by adjusting the algorithms to take advantage                of differences between EMA and FEA data.  The theory developed                  will be subjected to verification through tests on a number of                  laboratory structures.",
