 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued NSF support the successful Research               Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Evolutionary                    Biology at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH).  Drawing              on the research and teaching expertise of the Museum's scientific               staff, the program revolves around projects carefully designed to               introduce undergraduates to the excitement, challenge and relevance             of research careers in Evolutionary Biology.  The program is a                  comprehensive, interactive learning experience that has already                 proven highly successful in directing students into science career              tracks.  In addition to hands-on experience of research and                     publication the program includes a series of roundtable discussions             where students discuss their research, \"show and tell\" their latest             findings, and thrash-out ideas in an informal, friendly setting.                A Special Lecture Series introduces the students to eminent                     scientists whose lectures address current debates in evolutionary               biology, systematics, the biodiversity crisis and the role of                   museum research in these areas.  Students will visit the Peabody                Museum at Yale University, and gain insight into the role of                    collections in teaching programs.  At the end of the program                    students participate in a Student Seminar where they give formal                slide illustrated presentations and answer questions from the                   floor.  The AMNH has established a comprehensive follow-up program              which enables them to maintain contact with REU alumni, provide                 support and track their careers.",
