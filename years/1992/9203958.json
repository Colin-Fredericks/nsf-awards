 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general purpose of this cooperative project is to carry out a               micro-level based investigation of the evolution and functioning                of rural market institutions in China.  Questions regarding both                individual and aggregate household behavior within newly-                       established rural markets will be addressed through the analysis                of data gathered in a multi-purpose household-level survey that                 will be modeled after the World Bank's Living Standard                          Measurement Study (LSMS) survey.  This household-level survey,                  which will be undertaken in the provinces of Hebel and Liaoning,                will be carried out in the Spring of 1993, and will extend to                   between 1200-1500 households in 24 villages.                                                                                                                    This project will contribute to our understanding of the                        complexities involved in economic institutional change through                  providing a case study of household decision-making amidst                      China's recent rural economic reforms.  Intended contributions                  are several:  First, the project will help to identify those                    factors at the local level in China that are presently impeding                 an expansion in the role of product and factor markets in                       resource allocation, and provide estimates of the resulting                     inefficiency.  Second, with elasticities obtained from the                      construction of an agricultural household model, the implications               of alternative price and tax policies in the agricultural sector                can be investigated, and better policies formulated.  Third,                    drawing on the household and village level data, estimates of the               degree of inequality both in consumption and income at the local                level can obtained, and sources of the inequality diagnosed.  And               fourth, drawing on time-series data dating back to the Land                     Reform, the implications of alternative policies for                            agriculture's long-term development will be investigated.  This                 kind of analysis will not only help to resolve lingering                        questions relating to the impact of rural reforms on productivity               and growth but will be of much wider interest now that Eastern                  Europe and the Soviet Union are embarking on similar paths.",
