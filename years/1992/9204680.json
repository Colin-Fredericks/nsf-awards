 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves collecting information on the structure              and electrical transport properties of silicates-analogue liquids               at high pressures and temperatures and on the structures of glasses             formed at high pressures and temperatures and quenched only in                  temperature.  The primary structural probes are vibrational                     spectroscopy: principally Raman spectroscopy for the liquids, and               infrared spectroscopy or quenched glasses held in situ at high                  pressures.  The plan is to utilize the externally heated diamond                cell to generate pressure and temperature for both spectroscopic                and conductivity experiments on liquids, and laser heating coupled              with the diamond anvil cell to form high pressure glasses.  Such                data are critically important in predicting and evaluating changes              in the physical properties, such as density and viscosity, of                   magmatic liquids under compression, and bear fundamentally on the               processes by which the Earth has differentiated to its present                  state.  The goals is to provide a structural basis for changes in               the geochemical, thermodynamics, and transport properties of                    silicate melts at high pressures.  These experiments have been                  rendered feasible by recent advancements in both the generation and             calibration of high pressures and temperatures within the diamond               anvil cell, as well as advances in solid-state detector technology.",
