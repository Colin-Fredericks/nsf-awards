 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ideal goal of feedback control theory, \"to                                  employ imperfect models and design perfect                                      systems,\"  critically depends on the characterizations                          of model imperfections and on the design                                        methodology.  If the uncertain nonlinearities can be                            characterized by a nonlinear bound or by a                                      parametrization for which an adaptive design is a                               available, then, as some of our results show, the                               designed system may be \"perfect\" in the sense that                              the ideal tracking performance is achieved globally.                            In this research we introduce structural and                                    parametric characterizations of model uncertainties                             and use them to develop adaptive and robust                                     nonlinear feedback designs which reduce the effects                             of uncertainties on system performance.  We plan                                to employ tuning functions to develop new adaptive                              output-feedback schemes with minimal                                            parametrizations and reduced complexity.  Our new                               partial-state-feedback schemes will exploit structural                          information to assess tradeoffs between additional                              measurements and stability augmentation.  We will                               analyze robustness not only with respect to                                     unmodeled dynamics and bound disturbance, but                                   also with respect to unmodeled nonlinearities.  The                             dead-zone and hysteresis characteristics are the                                representatives of the applications-motivated                                   uncertain nonlinearities to be addressed in the                                 second part of this research.",
