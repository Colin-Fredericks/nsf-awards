 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heme is a cofactor, present in many compartments of the plant call.             While the plastid contains all of the enzymes requried for its own              heme synthesis, the role of other compartments, such as the                     mitochondrion and cytoplasm, in heme synthesis is unknown.  In this             project we will determine the location of four heme-synthetic                   enzymes (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen                     oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase) within the              cell and within the organelle.  Enzyme activities will be measured              in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and cytoplasmic fractions that have              been carefully isolated and assayed for integrity and                           contamination.  We will further explore the possibility that intact             plastids have the capacity to export porphyrinogens for                         mitochondrial heme synthesis.  Recent findings suggest that plants              treated with protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors accumulate                   extraplastidic protoporphyrinogen.  Experiments to discover if any              of the enzymes which convert 5-aminolevulinic acid to                           protoporphyrinogen form a multienzyme complex within the plastid                are planned.  Substrate channeling between protoporphyrinogen                   oxidase and ferrochelatase will also be examined.  Two of the heme              and chlorophyll synthetic enzymes that have not been well studied               previously (coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase) will be              purified.  The purified proteins will be used to raise antibodies               in rabbits for use in studies on complex formation and localization             of these enzymes.",
