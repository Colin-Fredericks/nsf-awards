The                      Science As A Way Of Knowing (SAAWOK) series is targeted to                      those who teach first-year biology courses in colleges and                      universities and is sponsored by the Education Committee of                     ASZ.  Goals of SAAWOK are to encourage teachers to: 1)                          emphasize the concepts of biology in entry-level courses, 2)                    relate how scientific procedures lead to a better understanding                 of the natural world and to the solution of many important                      human problems, and 3) present biology as a relevant human                      discipline. The specific aims of this SAAWOK symposium are: 1)                  presenting a symposium on a timely topic, Biodiversity, 2)                      providing hands-on curricular materials on Biodiversity                         including symposium proceedings, overheads and slides, and                      essays to the participating teachers, and 3) disseminating                      these materials on a worldwide basis. Participants will include                 ASZ registrants as well as college, university and high school                  teachers from the Northwest U.S. and Canada who will be invited                 to register at a reduced fee.  Materials will be preprinted and                 distributed at the symposium and the symposium proceedings will                 be published in the American Zoologist.",
