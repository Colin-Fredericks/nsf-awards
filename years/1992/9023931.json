 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computation speed of modern computers is limited by the                resistance of the submicron metal lines used to interconnect                    devices.  One solution to the problem of inefficient interconnect               is a vertical interconnect between layered devices, a key to 3-D                integration.  Because IC fabrication is traditionally 2-D                       procedure, no method has been developed to create vertical                      submicron diameter \"wires\".  This electron elevator could be made               by a selective metal deposition process whereby a material                      catalyzed its own deposition, filling a well in an insulating                   material.  Loss of selectivity (LOS), leading to shorts between                 metal lines, is due to reaction with the noncatalytic insulator,                gas phase reactions, nucleation and deposition on the insulator,                and chemistries between reactive intermediates from the deposition              reaction.  Finding the process margin is a matter of understanding              all of the chemical pathways and relevant transport processes of                both the heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.  The LOS kinetics             are quite complex for the reactive species, have very short                     lifetimes, and can only be seen with in situ diagnostics.                            The goal of the research is to answer some very specific                   questions which cannot be answered in commercial or UHV reactors.               What is the role of thermodiffusion and recirculation in LPCVD                  reactors?  What are the gas phase intermediates, reactions, and                 products during selective CVD?  How do our LPCVD (1 torr) results               compare with those we determine in the UHV studies funded by NSF?               Over the long term, the research will lead to understanding what                other reactants could be used to create selectively deposited                   vertical wires and what the process margins are in terms of local               composition and temperature.                                                         Once the local conditions are known for selective deposition,              it becomes necessary to implement mathematical models of commercial             reactors so that the inlet gas composition which results in the                 desired near wafer composition can be determined.  This global                  model must also include modeling of the transience within the                   submicron well as it fills.  Current models will be extended to new             chemistries.",
