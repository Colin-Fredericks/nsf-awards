The workshop will be                                             held in Washington, DC in 1993. The                                             goals of the workshop are: 1) to                                                identify the progress made in the                                               field in recent years; 2) to                                                    identify the major obstacles to                                                 progress and determine the research                                             required to overcome the obstacles;                                             and 3) to identify  new research                                                opportunities created by emerging                                               technologies.                                                                                                                                                   This workshop is important since                                                the area that will be covered is an                                             emerging one that requires                                                      interdisciplinary research to                                                   advance technology.  The                                                        participants will include                                                       researchers, end users, and                                                     representatives from surgical                                                   device manufacturers, hospitals,                                                and regulatory agencies.  A report                                              will be written that will summarize                                             the results of the workshop.",
