 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists                in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, to be held                  July 5-11, 1992 in Berkeley, California.  The co-organizers are                 Professor Virgil Schrock, Department of Nuclear Engineering,                    University of California Berkeley, and Professor Tadashi                        Sakaguchi, Department of Production Engineering, Kobe University,               Japan.                                                                                                                                                          Two-phase flow dynamics is a short name for the complex                         problems that involve the transient and steady state motions of                 fluids comprised of more than one phase.  Such flows are                        especially challenging to analyze because the interface                         separating the phases is usually moving and changing in a very                  complex way that depends upon mechanical, thermodynamic, and                    sometimes chemical effects.  This seminar will deal with selected               topics in two-phase flow dynamics that are fundamental problems                 in their own right and are central to  analysis of large complex                energy systems, especially the transient behavior of such systems               and their esponses in hypothetical accident scenarios.  The                     research now underway by the U.S. and Japanese seminar                          participants has begun to identify new approaches that hold the                 promise of substantial improvement in the predictive capability                 of two-phase flow analysis.  The participants will discuss the                  current state of knowledge in this field and the difficult                      unresolved problems, and they will attempt to develop a vision of               how the subject can be advanced and what directions for future                  research will be most promising.",
