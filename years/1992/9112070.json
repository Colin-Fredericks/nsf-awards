 "awd_abstract_narration": "The skulls of humans as well as other mammals are                          characterized by air sinuses associated with the nasal cavity and               the middle ear.  The mammalian sinuses tend to be minor aspects of              skull form.  However, another group of vertebrate animals, the                  Archosauria, certain extinct dinosaur groups and their presumed                 living descendants the birds and crocodiles, exhibit air sinuses                in the skull but of different shape and position from those of                  mammals.  In many archosaurs, sinuses dominate skull morphology.                Although archosaurs have been the most diverse land vertebrates                 for over 200 million years, their important anatomical system of                sinuses has been neglected in morphological studies.  Consequently              it has not been possible to determine which sinuses are strictly                comparable among archosaurs, that is, which are \"homologous\" in an              evolutionary sense, having evolved from the same developmental and              anatomical source in ancestral forms.                                                Faculty sponsor David Weishampel and graduate student Lawrence             Witmer are studying the air sinus systems in several representative             samples of living birds and crocodiles and in well preserved skull              fossils of extinct archosaurs.  Their methods of study include                  sophisticated clearing and double staining procedures with the                  modern forms, and the use of elaborate casts from fossil forms.                 Their comparative data will help determine which features of the                air sinus system are similar or different among archosaurs and                  which features provide strong evidence for close genealogical                   relationship within the group.  When correlated with what is known              about the life history of the animal, whether fossil or living, the             skull sinus data may help in solving the puzzle about what                      functions these cavities perform in the life of the organism.",
