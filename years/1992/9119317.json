 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports measurement and analysis of the nature of                   fluctuations in optical paths through the atmosphere.  The results              should be of importance for optimizing designs for adaptive optics,             for large telescopes, and for spatial interferometers operating                 from the ground.  Measurements will be made with the Infrared                   Spatial Interferometer (ISI) now installed on Mount Wilson, which               has already been useful in initiating such measurements.  The                   initial measurements appear to show that for conditions encountered             in ground-based astronomy, pathlength fluctuation often differ                  significantly from those expected on the basis of the standard                  model of Kolmogorov turbulence and Taylor's approximation.                      Furthermore, these deviations can have a significant bearing on                 the design of future large aperture instruments and their extension             into the infrared region.  The program will measure fluctuations                in pathlength differences from a stellar object to the two                      telescopes and also fluctuations near the ground at the position                of the two telescopes.  These will be correlated with such                      parameters as wind speed, time of day, astronomical seeing, and                 cloud cover.  The measurements will yield the structure function                of time, Allan variances, and power spectra.  In addition,                      examination of correlations between the laser interferometers and               the IR interference fringe signals with various telescope                       separations will provide direct information on the structure                    function of distance.  Observations over a period of time and under             various conditions applicable to astronomical observations from                 the ground are needed in order to obtain an adequate statistical                sample.",
