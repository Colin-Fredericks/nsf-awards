 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of short-pulse lasers has generated new techniques to                   fabricate sophisticated microstructures and to synthesize                       advanced materials. These techniques have made tremendous                       impacts on the microelectronics industry. To improve the                        design and quality control of these techniques, a research                      plan is proposed to gain understanding of energy deposition                     and transport during short-pulse laser-material interactions                    and in microstructures. The work will develop more appropriate                  macroscopic models for energy deposition and transport                          processes by characterizing microscopic transport and                           interactions of energy carriers (e.g. electrons and phonons).                   Experimental investigation of sub-picosecond laser heating                      will also be carried out. The objective of the research                         program is to achieve a better understanding of the                             fundamental heat transfer mechanisms in different time scale                    regimes and to establish analytical framework for modelling                     fast laser heat of complex microsctructures.",
