 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and analyze algorithms for                       multipoint routing in communication networks. A multipoint                      connection, instead of joining just two hosts by a path, joins a                set of two or more hosts; and instead of a single path, a                       multipoint connection consists of a  set of links and switches                  creating multiple paths, usually in the form of a tree.  The                    underlying model used here is a connection oriented communication               network represented by an undirected graph with edge costs. In                  addition, bandwidth is reserved for each  connection, so that                   communication delay is not the main consideration, but, instead,                the  main criteria for route selection is the minimal usage of                  network resources. Finally, since a practical multipoint routing                algorithm must be able to deal with a set of hosts that changes                 over time, the dynamic Steiner tree problem is the appropriate                  graph theoretic model for this problem.  This investigation                     will include empirical studies of routing algorithms through the                use  of a routing simulator along with the more theoretical                     analysis. The primary objective is to develop more efficient                    multipoint routing algorithms that will allow future networks to                effectively support a wide range of applications such as                        conference calls and video broadcasts.",
