 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will (a) develop theory linking the                       responses of individuals to spatial variation in population and                 ecosystem dynamics; (b) test such theory by experimental field                  studies and simulation modeling; (c) determine how ecological                   features vary with spatial scale and whether \"rules\" can be                     defined for extrapolating among scales; and (d) extend this work                to systems composed of tropically linked species.  The field                    research, conducted in a semiarid grassland ecosystem, will                     involve experimental studies of responses of tenebrionid beetles                to the spatial structure of \"microlandscapes\" and to variations in              spatial patterns at broader scales.  Individual movement patterns               at fine scales will be coupled with long-distance movements to                  determine how individual behavior translates into population                    distribution.  Experiments with harvester ants will be used to                  determine how the removal and transport of seeds are affected by                the spatial structure of ecosystems.  Scaling relationships among               linked trophic levels will be investigated using horned lizard-ant              and longspur-grasshopper systems.  The research bears directly on               current issues in ecological scaling and extrapolation, flows of                materials across patch boundaries, empirical testing of spatial                 models, and the development of an experimental and theoretical                  approach to landscape ecology.",
