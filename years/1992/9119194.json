 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two marine geological cruises to the fjords                 and continental shelf of southern Chile.  Research will                         concentrate on the collection and analysis of single channel                    seismic reflection data, 3.5 KHz profiler data, and piston cores.               This work will examine fundamental questions concerning the                     dynamics of the Patagonian ice sheet during the late Wisconsin                  glaciation and how it responded to changing marine and                          terrestrial climate during the last glacial/interglacial                        transition.                                                                                                                                                     This project represents an extension of current investigations                  into the marine geology of the Antarctic Peninsula to include                   glacial marine environments from a wider latitudinal range.  In                 order to enhance the applicability of litho and seismo-                         stratigraphic studies to a broader range of Quaternary science,                 this research will be conducted in cooperation with other                       researchers investigating marine and terrestrial paleoclimate.                  Down core changes in micro-flora (diatoms) and micro-fauna will                 be examined in conjunction with geochemical and isotopic                        analyses.  Palynological studies of some cores will be undertaken               in an attempt to refine our misunderstanding of the relationship                between terrestrial and marine paleoclimates.  The project will                 also be undertaken in cooperation with Chilean researchers who                  are interested in the sedimentary and tectonic history of the                   region.  By extending the marine studies of the Antarctic                       Peninsula to Patagonia, and by broadening their scope to include                land-sea correlations, valuable insight will be gained into                     spatial and temporal changes on climate along a broad range of                  latitudes.",
