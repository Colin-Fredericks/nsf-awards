 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support to continue offering summer                      institutes on the topics of molecular biology and biotechnology                 for community college teachers.  The first of these was held in                 the summer of 1990 under an NSF grant:  Undergraduate Faculty                   Enhancement Program.  Two more similar institutes are proposed                  to be offered in the summers of 1992 and 1993.  The workshops                   will be cosponsored by the community colleges of the State and                  the University of Illinois.  The objectives of the workshops                    are these:  1) to upgrade teachers' knowledge of molecular                      biology and biotechnology; 2) to provide hands-on laboratory                    experiences with the methods and techniques of molecular                        biology; 3) to encourage the formulation of a personal teaching                 plan for including instruction in molecular biology and                         biotechnology at the participant's home institution, and 4) to                  form an active educational partnership between the state                        community college biology teachers and the University.  These                   teachers will establish a network for the purposes of sharing                   experiences and information and for continuing in-service                       education.",
