The research examines the process by                                                                                                which participants form opinions about what constitutes ethical                 research with animals and the factors that lead to escalation and                                                                                               deescalation of conflicts.  The analysis draws on three years of                                                                                                observations at organization meetings, symposia and protests of                 animal rights activists and biomedical researchers in two                       communities in a Southern state of the United States.  These data                                                                                               are supplemented with 50 interviews of participants, a review of                                                                                                media coverage, and analysis of literature developed and                        distributed by the animal rights and biomedical research                        community.  This grant will enable the researcher to extend his                 observations to and collect data in a second community.  Results                                                                                                will provide a theoretical and practical contribution to                        understanding social movements and the emergence of ethical                     conflicts involving science and technology.",
