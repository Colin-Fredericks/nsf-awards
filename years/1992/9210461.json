 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although there is a consensus that major long-term global                  climate changes occurred during the Pennsylvanian in North America,             there are fundamental disagreements in the frequency and magnitude              of these inferred climate changes.  Are the disparities in the                  inferred records of Pennsylvanian climates reflections of                       nonuniform methodologies?  Or results of regional climate                       fluctuations?  In this proposal it is planned to readdress this                 issue through an innovative approach in which the quantitative                  changes in the distribution of both clay-mineral and pollen and                 spore assemblages will be documented on individual rock specimens               from selected continental sequences in the Appalachian Basin.  The              integration of combined clay/pollen study will  provide high                    resolution analysis and at the same time allow the comparison of                clay and pollen curves to isolated differences that may arise from              employing different methodologies.  Reconstructed climate changes               will be compared against the Pennsylvanian climate trends                       established by other workers.  In this proposal I will answer the               following questions using microfacies studies and quantitative                  variations of the clay-mineral and pollen/spore flora assemblages               across stratigraphic boundaries.  1) Are the aridities postulated               for the early Middle Pennsylvanian and Late Pennsylvanian recorded              in the clay mineral assemblages? 2) Are the abrupt climate changes              suggested by plant extinctions during the two arid intervals                    indicated in the clay mineral assemblages? 3) Are there                         similarities in the onset of aridity between the earlier and later              arid intervals?  4) Does the clay-mineral assemblages record minor              climate fluctuations not indicated in the paleoflora or in the                  large-scale sedimentological features?  This research will increase             the understanding of Pennsylvanian climate changes, and assess the              regional applicability of this rigorous and comprehensive approach              in documenting climatic signatures from continental deposits.",
