 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator is developing an integrated framework           for the specification and analysis of real-time systems.  Since the             timing behavior of a system critically depends on the availability of           shared resources,the approach unites the areas of process                       specification, concurrency theory and real-time scheduling.  The                result is a layered framework called Communication Shared Resources.            At the top layer is the CSR Application Language, which describes the           functional and temporal requirements of a system.  At the next layer            is the CSR Configuration Language, which maps process to resources,             and specifies the system's interconnection network.  At the lowest              level is the CCSR process algebra, which embraces a resource-based              view of concurrency,and is defined by a prioritized operational                 semantics.                                                                           The researcher is constructing an integrated toolset based on              this theory.  A reachability analyzer checks for violations of real-            time constraints explicitly denoted within a finite-state                       applications.  A model-checker is used to verify real-time safety               assertions that are not denoted within an application.  Finally, a              simulator tests the system, using test suites generated from the                characteristics of the implementation environment.",
