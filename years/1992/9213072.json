 "awd_abstract_narration": "The frequency, character, seasonality, and diurnal phasing                 of convection are important components of the climatology of a                  place or region.  The southern Great Lakes region of the United                 States has been understudied in this regard.  It lies within a                  transition zone separating western regions where nocturnal                      thunderstorms predominate during the warm season and eastern                    regions where thunderstorms occur mostly during the daytime.                    This makes the southern Great Lakes unique in that nocturnal and                daytime convection are equally frequent during the warm months of               the year.  The nature and extent of the influence of lake breezes               and land-water temperature differences and their relationship to                the occurrence, timing, and intensity of convection is unknown                  for this region.  This research will document, using lightning                  and radar observations, the convective climatology of the                       southern Great Lakes region at a fine temporal and spatial scale.               The project will identify the differences in the statistical                    properties of nocturnal versus daytime convective systems, and                  examine the nature and extent of variations in convective                       frequency and timing.  Differences in the meso-alpha scale and                  synoptic scale atmospheric environment in which nocturnal and                   daytime convective events form will be evaluated.  This will                    assist in an assessment of the relative hazard to human life and                property posed by convective storms in terms of potential                       lightning damage and the probability of heavy precipitation.                         The improved convective climatology resulting from this                    research will allow for a re-evaluation of currently proposed                   explanations for differences in the diurnal phasing of convective               storms.  The linkages identified between the statistical                        properties of convective storms and the large-scale environments                in which they form can be employed in the short-range forecasting               of convection.",
