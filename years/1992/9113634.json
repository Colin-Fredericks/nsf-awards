He will                    continue methods development in three areas.  To improve the                    time to solution on multiprocessing computers, he will continue                 working on parallel code of which the gradient section is now                   complete.  In order to handle large numbers of electrons and                    orbitals, he will implement a modification of the complete                      active space multiconfiguration self-consistent-field                           technique.  Lastly, he will continue the use of and improve the                 understanding of the topological method of analysis due to                      Bader.  The systems to be studied are related to three                          fundamental steps in catalysis: oxidative-addition,                             substitution, and migratory-insertion.  Specifically, he will                   examine several important questions about the nature of the C-H                 activation.  The methods to be utilized will allow him to draw                  conclusions about a group of closely related molecules with                     modest basis sets and a moderate degree of electron correlation.                %%%                                                                             Professor Hall will perform theoretical compuations that will                   aid in understanding the elementary steps in a number of                        chemical reactions that are important in catalytic processes.",
