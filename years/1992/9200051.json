The program is designed to                 immerse a small group (8) of undergraduates in an active research               environment spanning the areas of mass communication, gender                    studies, behavioral sociology, and the sociology of business.  The              goal underlying this initiative is to introduce students to on-                 going research in some of the most interesting and important areas              of sociology.  The program is intended to foster interest in,                   appreciation for, and skills in basic scientific research,                      especially for students who might not otherwise have an opportunity             to participate in this type activity.  Students will engage in a                intensive eight-week hands-on research experience wherein they will             be afforded the opportunity to learn, the phases of the search                  process, data gathering manipulation and analyses, theory testing               construction, development of historical topologies of sociological              phenomena, and relevant statistical and computer applications.                  Recruitment effort will center on small and regional colleges with              large enrollments of minorities and women.  Those selected to                   participate will reflect the recruiting focus.  Support services,               informal and structured experiences are planned to encourage                    graduate study and/or research-oriented careers.",
