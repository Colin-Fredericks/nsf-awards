 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is and NSF-initiated planning workshop to                         determine research problems in the area of spoken language                      understanding that deserve future funding.  The main goals of the               workshop are: (a) it identifies the most important areas of                     research in speech and natural language understanding, with                     particular attention to those not currently addressed by NSF or                 other funding agencies; (b) to determine how NSF can benefit from               other programs, such as the DARPA speech and natural language                   program, and yet distinguish itself from these programs; and (c)                to produce a set of recommendations to NSF to help guide funding                opportunities.  The workshop participants represent a balance of                researchers in the areas of speech recognition, natural language                understanding and human computer interaction.  Participants                     include researchers with NSF grants and researchers in government               and industrial laboratories.  The workshop will consist of                      plenary sessions and breakout groups focused on three research                  areas:  robust systems; the interaction of speech and natural                   language; and human-computer interaction.",
