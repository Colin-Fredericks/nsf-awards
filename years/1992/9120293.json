 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general focus of this research is to test the hypothesis               that different mitochondrial genomes affect the reproductive rate               or \"fitness\" of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.  The                     research will employ experimental population cages where flies                  carrying different mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) are competed                     against one another to determine whether certain mitochondrial                  genotypes have consistent reproductive advantages over other                    genotypes.  The experiments will involve genetic crosses to                     construct strains of flies that have the same nuclear chromosomes               but differ only in their mtDNAs.  Several pairwise tests of                     competitive ability will be conducted between strains of flies                  from different populations.  The populations have been chosen so                that the pairwise tests will involve strains of flies with                      little, moderate and large amounts of DNA sequence difference                   between the competing mitochondrial genomes.  This should provide               a test of the effect of DNA sequence difference on the strength                 of the fitness different between strains.                                            The research also involves a complementary set of                          experiments to test the \"fitness\" of different mtDNAs inside                    cells.  Using a microinjection technique to transplant intact                   mitochondria between strains of fruit flies, one can create a                   miniature \"population cage\" inside the reproductive cells of                    female flies.  By creating reproductive cells with mixtures of                  different mtDNAs, one can test the hypothesis that  different                   mitochondrial genomes have an advantage in inheritance from                     mother to offspring.  This approach will be employed with the                   same strains of flies used in the population cage experiments                   described above.  This \"two-level\" approach to the study of mtDNA               variation will provide information on the functional significance               of naturally occurring variation in mtDNA and serve as a model                  system to study the coevolution of nuclear and mitochondrial                    genomes.  Furthermore, this research will test the critical                     assumption for many studies of population dynamics that mtDNA                   variation is neutral.",
