 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central unresolved question in visual physiology and biochemistry             is:  How does light cause the creation of nerve signals in the                  retina?  This process is called \"visual transduction.\"  Nerve                   signals generated during transduction are further processed and                 encoded by higher-order cells in the retina and ultimately, in the              brain.  Exciting new developments in genetics, biochemistry, and                electrophysiology have made the Drosophila (fruit fly) visual                   system a new model preparation with which to examine visual                     transduction.  This elegantly simple experimental system promises               to yield rapid advances in our understanding of the physiology and              biochemistry of biological signalling.                                                                                                                          In particular, this research will offer a new scientific                        description of crucial intracellular events in visual transduction,             by studying the isolated photoreceptor preparation.  Using light-               induced introduction of calcium ions into the intracellular space               of a single photoreceptor will also enable a variety of significant             questions to be answered in this model preparation that will have               major significance for understanding the processes of visual                    transduction that occur, generally, in other species.",
