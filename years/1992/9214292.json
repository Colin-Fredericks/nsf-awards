 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to renovate                                   research space (4,328 net square feet) in Olin Hall                             for the Departments of Physics/Astronomy and                                    Psychology.                                                                          The renovation is part of a detailed, long-                                range plan developed by the College.  In 1993                                   construction will begin on a new biology building                               that will be attached to Olin.  When the Biology                                Department leaves for its new quarters, Olin will                               be renovated to provide modern research and                                     teaching facilities.                                                                 The remodeling of the physics/astronomy                                    facilities will provide the department with a                                   computer laboratory and greatly improved research                               facilities in the areas of molecular biophysics,                                condensed matter physics, and atomic and nuclear                                physics.  Reconfiguration of space and                                          modernization of services will allow for greater                                flexibility and efficiency which will lead to                                   increased productivity.  Graduating an average of                               20 majors per year, the Physics/Astronomy                                       Department typically has 10-15 students working                                 with 6 faculty on research during the academic year                             and summers.  These collaborations will be greatly                              enhanced by the modernization of research                                       facilities.                                                                          Currently the Psychology Department labors in                              facilities that are extremely small and poorly                                  designed for experimental work.  With this                                      renovation the Psychology Department hopes to                                   obtain the research facilities that can support                                 properly the level of research activities currently                             taking place.  As in Physics/Astronomy, students                                are a major part of the Psychology Department                                   research program.  Psychology graduates an average                              of 30 students a year, and in a typical year, 10-15                             students work with 6 faculty on research.",
