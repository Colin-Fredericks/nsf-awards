 "awd_abstract_narration": "Muscle fibers contain as many as 10,000 nuclei bounded by a single              cell membrane, in contrast to most cells of the body which contain              only one nucleus and only one copy of the genetic blueprint for the             cell.  During development, many individual muscle precursor cells               fuse together to form each large muscle fiber.  A basic problem                 arises when one considers that muscle fibers are separated into                 three, largely discrete, functional domains.  Most of the length of             each fiber contains contractile machinery, but the ends of the                  fibers are specialized for attachment to tendons while the very                 small synaptic region in the middle is specialized for attachment               to tendons while the very small synaptic region in the middle is                specialized for response to neurotransmission.  To what extent can              nuclei that have fused into one part of a muscle fiber contribute               to a specialized function that occurs in another part of the same               muscle fiber?  The answer to this question is essential to an                   understanding of the regulation and organization of muscle fibers.              The proposed research addresses the nuclear contribution to the                 small but essential post-synaptic specialization where the muscle               receives instruction from the motor neuron.  Cells of a muscle cell             line in tissue culture can be induced to fuse into multi-nucleated              myotubes which spontaneously contract and express elements of the               post-synaptic specialization even in the absence of neurons.  When              muscle cells of different genetic origin are co-cultured, hybrid                myotubes form which contain nuclei from both sources.  A                        computerized microscope can then be used to track the different                 nuclei and the molecules that they contribute to the post-synaptic              specialization.  With this approach, it will be possible to decide              whether an identified nucleus is always associated with a                       post-synaptic domain or whether it is free to migrate within the                myotube, thereby expanding its zone of influence.  Careful mapping              of the post-synaptic molecules on the myotube surface will also                 provide an understanding of how fixed and mobile components of the              post-synaptic specialization interact.",
