 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between Michael Milgroom, Cornell                    University, and Wang Kerong, Nanjing Agricultural University,                   Nanjing, China, will compare the genetic diversity and population               structure of the chestnut blight fungus and its virus-like                      double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) parasites in China and the US.  At                  least eight populations in China will be sampled, and using                     molecular genetic markers identified in previous studies, fungal                isolates from each population will be analyzed for genetic                      variability.  The extent of population subdivision will be                      determined, from which inferences can be made about gene flows                  among fungus populations.  Fungal isolates from China will be                   screened for dsRNAs in order to estimate prevalence in Chinese                  populations.                                                                                                                                                    The chestnut blight fungus was introduced into the US from China                at the turn of the century and devastated the previously abundant               chestnut forests in the eastern US.  Studying the fungus                        populations at their source in China is an opportunity to                       understand the basic factors that affect the population biology                 of this species in a long-established, relatively stable                        population.  This study is also expected to be useful for the                   development of a biological control program of the fungus.",
