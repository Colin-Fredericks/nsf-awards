 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study how characteristics of                         communities influence the occurrence and timing of several                      dimensions of the transition to adulthood, for example the                      decision to get married, and to have the first child.  The study                will focus in particular on the relationship between out-of-                    wedlock childbearing and the relative availability of marriage                  partners in a community, and on the degree to which community                   characteristics can account for racial and ethnic differences in                the transition to adulthood.                                                         Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY)                 will be linked with data for counties and metropolitan areas from               the Census and other sources.  Event history models will be                     estimated to determine the impact of the community level                        variables on the transition to adulthood.                                            This study will provide a valuable contribution to a large                 literature on the transition to adulthood in American society.                  Its unique contribution will be to shed light on how the                        communities in which young people live may affect the choices and               decisions they make early in life in particular with respect to                 decisions about childbearing, marriage, and sexual activity.",
