Wells and Richard                                   Luettich of the Institute of Marine Sciences of                                 the University of North Carolina to collaborate                                 in physical oceanography with Doeke Eisma and                                   others of the Netherlands Institute for Sea                                     Research.  The objective of their research is to                                increase understanding of the behavior of large                                 particle aggregates in the shallow coastal areas                                under natural conditions.  Dr. Wells and his                                    group are currently carrying out research on                                    this off the coast of North Carolina.  Funding                                  from this award will enable them to extend this                                 observational program to a second set of field                                  sites in the North Sea where similar studies are                                being carried out by Dutch researchers under the                                direction of Doeke Eisma.  Both field efforts                                   will benefit from techniques developed                                          independently in each other's laboratories.                                                                                                                     Understanding the behavior of particle                                          aggregates in shallow water bodies is a very                                    difficult problem about which almost nothing is                                 known.  It is also a very important problem,                                    with both fundamental and immediately applicable                                implications.  The fundamental scientific                                       interest is in understanding geological                                         processes in marine systems (erosion,                                           deposition, etc.) while the practical value is                                  the implications for understanding the transport                                and fate of marine pollutants, which are known                                  to become attached to fine particles that often                                 form large aggregates.",
