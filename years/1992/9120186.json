They                  will utilize the forward kinematic control algorithms Wampler has               developed to test a prototype parallel-link manipulator robot Dr.               Arai designed and built.                                                                                                                                        The Stewart platform, a parallel-link manipulator, has mainly been              used for aircraft simulators and similar applications since the mid             1980's.  Dr. Arai has designed and built a prototype Stewart-                   platform manipulator for use in underground excavation.                         Excavation requires the manipulator to exert large forces, and in               order to optimize the manipulator's ability to exert such forces, a             seventh serial-link leg was added to the center of Arai's                       manipulator, effectively reducing the size of workspace.  Dr.                   Wampler proposes to develop a way to eliminate the seventh leg by               adding extra joints and instrumentation to the original six legs, to            calibrate the robot with six legs, then to test their theoretical work          on Dr. Arai's robot.  Dr. Arai's expertise in robotics, particularly            the parallel-link manipulator, complements Dr. Wampler's                        experience in kinematics of manipulators and numerical solution of              polynomial systems.  This collaborative research will provide                   Wampler with first-hand knowledge of leading-edge Japanese                      research in robotics.",
