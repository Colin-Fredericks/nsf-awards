 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosion in computer capacity in the past decade                      has been accompanied by a reorientation of econometrics                         toward using computer-intensive methods to reveal more about                    data and sharpen the inferences drawn.  Innovations have been                   particularly intense in the areas of semiparametric and                         nonparametric estimation,  use of resampling methods and                        cross-validation in parametric and nonparametric models,                        simulation methods for inference,  estimation of dynamic                        stochastic programming models,  and Bayesian methods.                           Translation of these methods into applications software and                     empirical econometrics has been uneven,  partly because                         computational capacity has not been generally available.                             The primary objective of this project is to accelerate                     research on computationally intensive methods and                               applications,  and to encourage more rapid testing ,                            documentation,  and dissemination of algorithms.  It plans to                   provide UNIX workstations for a consortium of researchers                       working on computationally intensive econometrics,  and a                       common file server to facilitate access to software and data.                   In addition to the facilities at Berkeley, described in this                    core proposal,  there are subproposals from scholars at                         several other institutions who are working in the same area.                    The Berkeley file server will provide access not only for                       these scholars,  but also for others not included in this                       proposal,  to specialized software and data sets.                                    The technology which is planned for both the Berkeley                      research programs and the consortium computing facility is                      well suited to the computing demands.  It offers the promise                    of significant advances in theoretical econometric modelling                    methods.",
