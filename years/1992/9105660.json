 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the propagation of dark spatial solitons in                           a variety of different material systems has been                                observed by the PI.  These systems include sodium                               vapor, various thermal liquids, and the bulk                                    semiconductors ZnSe and GaAs.  The work described                               in this proposal will consist of experimental,                                  theoretical, and numerical efforts, and represents a                            comprehensive program designed to understand the                                fundamental nature of the propagation of dark spatial                           soliton eigenmodes in general self-defocusing                                   nonlinear optical media.  We will investigate in detail                         the collision and stability properties of these solitons                        when they are subjected to experimental                                         perturbations.  Such perturbations may include loss                             (both linear and nonlinear absorption), deviation                               from the simple Kerr-law dependence of the real part                            of the refractive index, and instabilities induced by                           the difference in dimensionality between the                                    experimental situation and the one typically assumed                            for theoretical treatments of the problem.  In                                  addition to the experiments to be performed in bulk                             nonlinear optical media, a series of experiments                                designed to investigate the propagation characteristics                         of dark surface waves will be performed.  Dark                                  surface waves are a new kind of wave discovered by                              the PI which are closely related to dark spatial                                solitons and are expected to have application in the                            area of nonlinear integrated optics.",
