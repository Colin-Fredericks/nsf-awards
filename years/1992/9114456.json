 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported by this award will cover broad areas of                     mathematical analysis directed at problems arising from                         mathematical physics, liquid crystals, fluid dynamics, free                     boundary problems and differential geometry.  The core of the                   research is in partial differential equations and systems of                    ordinary differential equations.                                                     A distinctive feature of this grant is its support of the                  ongoing postdoctoral and visitor program at the Courant Institute               of Mathematical Sciences.  The institute provides a unique                      opportunity for young mathematical scientists to gain new                       insights into the applicability of their researches, a tradition                at the institute since its inception.  The vast number of U.S.                  mathematicians who have been imprinted by the CIMS spirit as                    students, postdocs or visitors is unmatched anywhere else.                      Probably even in the world.                                                          Much of the present work will focus on nonlinear equations.                One class of problems concerns the question of monotonicity of                  solutions of nonlinear second order equations in prescribed                     directions.  This type of problem arises in the analysis of flame               propagation in cylinders.  In a different direction work will                   also be done to determine whether there exist periodic solutions                to vector-valued ordinary differential equations with a time                    periodic forcing function.  Additionally, the classical sine-                   Gordon equation has been used by mathematicians to provide                      examples of solitary waves as solutions of relatively simple                    nonlinear equations.  It has been suspected that solutions which                decay at infinity (called breathers) are nonexistent.  Techniques               necessary for the resolution of this problem are probably now                   developed to the point where an answer can be expected in the                   short term.  Work will be done toward this goal.",
