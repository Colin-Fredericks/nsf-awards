 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the role of soil-stream interfaces as                   control-points for the speciation (NO3-vs. NO2-vs. NH4+vs. DON vs.              N2O) and flux of N in a heterogeneous landscape.  Biogeochemical                transformations of N at the soil-stream interface may have                      important effects on both the quantity and quality (speciation) of              N lost to downstream ecosystems, and may modify the extent to                   which h the chemistry of watershed streams are affected by                      watershed processes.  A mechanistic understanding of such N                     transformations along soil-stream flowpaths may therefore be                    critical in order to predict how watershed disturbances (both                   short-term and chronic) will affect surface-water chemistry.                    Preliminary studies from the Augusta Creek Watershed have pointed               to soil-stream interfaces as potential control-points for                       downstream speciation and flux of N.  The work outlined in this                 project seeks to provide an understanding of rates and mechanisms               of N transformations along explicit soil-stream hydrologic                      flowpaths in the watershed.  The principal investigators will use               both descriptive and experimental approaches, including the use of              tracers of hydrologic flowpaths (LiBr) and tracers for specific                 biogeochemical reactions (stable N isotopes).  The main goal is to              understand how patterns of N transformations at soil-stream                     interfaces vary in space, time,and as a function of hydrology.",
