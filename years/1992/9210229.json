 "awd_abstract_narration": "During synapse elimination, adult patterns of synaptic connections              are established through an elimination of excess neural                         connections.  For example, although adult mammalian muscle fibers               are each typically innervated by only a single motoneuron, in                   newborns, muscle fibers receive innervation from several different              motoneurons.  During synapse elimination, all but one motoneuronal              input is retracted from each muscle fiber, thus establishing the                adult pattern of single innervation.  In the hormone-sensitive                  perineal levator ani (LA) muscle of the rat, synapse elimination is             regulated by androgen.  Testosterone (T) treatment of castrated                 males prevents some synapse elimination.  Notable, T treatment has              no effect on synapse elimination in the extensor digitorum longus               muscle (EDL), a limb muscle generally less sensitive to androgen.               The primary goal of the proposed experiments is to determine the                site where androgen acts to alter synapse elimination.  Three                   candidate sites will be tested: the brain, the spinal cord, and the             LA muscle.  One experiment will examine the effect of 3 different               androgen metabolites (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and                    estradiol) on synapse elimination in the LA and EDL.  Results from              this experiment will identify the active metabolite that influences             synapse elimination in the LA and given our current knowledge about             the steroid binding and/or accumulating characteristics of rat                  motoneurons, and their target muscles, may also suggest where                   androgen acts.  A second experiment will examine the effects of                 systemic androgen on synapse elimination in the LA of spinally                  transected animals to test whether androgen acts in the brain to                alter synapse elimination in the LA muscle.  3,4) Two additional                experiments will assess whether androgen acts on the muscle or in               the spinal cord to influence synapse elimination in the LA by                   locally exposing each site to androgen.  Information about where                androgen acts to prevents synapse elimination in the LA is                      necessary for directing future experiments aimed at identifying the             mechanisms underlying synapse elimination that are regulated by                 androgen.",
