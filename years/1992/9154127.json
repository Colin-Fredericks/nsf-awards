 "awd_abstract_narration": "VideoGraph is an instructional tool created for use in                          introductory physics laboratories at the high school and                        college levels.  It allows students to videotape motion                         events, and using the graphing capabilities of a                                microcomputer, to simultaneously examine and analyze the                        motion.  In this revision of the initial software package,                      which received the Ohaus Award in 1989, the developers are                      enhancing the original capabilities of the program,                             including high quality color images and support for access                      to videodiscs.  In addition, it will allow students to save                     previously recorded events, whether recorded on videotape or                    played from a videodisc, and \"draw\" events using paint                          applications or programming language.  In this way, students                    will be able to analyze previously recorded events or even                      simulated microworlds in which the laws of motion are                           preprogrammed into the system.  In addition to developing                       the software, this project will conduct classroom studies to                    facilitate its integration into traditional classroom,                          laboratory, and homework activities.  It is also refining a                     previously developed test of student skills in motion graph                     interpretation, and plans to develop observational schemes                      and alternative assessment methods to verify that the                           materials are having an impact on student understanding.",
