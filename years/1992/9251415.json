 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction to Technical WritingThis project is designed to                    significantly improve the introductory physics laboratory at                    Saint Anselm College.  It has two specific aims:  1) new sets                   of experiments allow engineering students and biology students                  to follow distinct pathways, each suited to the later academic                  and professional emphases of the individual; and 2) new                         computer facilities, both hardware and software, allow a new                    and more modern emphasis on data processing and data analysis,                  together with special attention to technical writing skills.                    The introductory physics laboratory is a combined one - it                      handles students from the calculus-based course (engineering                    and chemistry students) and from the algebra based course                       (biology students).  The new two-path concept exposes                           engineering students to experiments dealing with  properties of                 materials, aerodynamics, and the Stirling engine.  The biology                  students follow a track intended to achieve a firm grounding in                 x-ray properties.  The new computer facilities equip an already                 existing suite of rooms where students gather for study, and                    pre- and post-lab work.  The laboratory reports stress modern                   technical communications skills, both as to content and form.",
