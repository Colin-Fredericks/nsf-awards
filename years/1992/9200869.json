 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term research visit by Professor                 Yonhua Tzeng, Department of Electrical Engineering, Auburn                      University in Alabama to Japan for a cooperative research project               with Professor Masanori Yoshikawa, Department of Mechanical                     Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology.  The researchers plan               to undertake a study on diamond film synthesis by arc discharge                 plasma jets and the polishing of deposited diamond films by                     mechanical and chemical means.  During his visit to Japan                       Professor Tzeng will also be visiting Professors Masao Murakawa                 and Y. Hirose in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the                Nippon Institute of Technology in Saitama.  During these visits                 they will be performing research on ion plating of cubic boron                  nitride films and flame CD of diamond films.                                                                                                                    The research results have the potential of achieving high-rate                  deposition and cost-effective polishing of diamond and cubic                    boron nitride films which are crucial to practical applications                 of these high performance materials to electronic, optical,                     thermal, and mechanical devices and systems.  Professors                        Yoshikawa, Murakawa and Hirose are all recognized experts and                   their laboratories are world leaders in the areas of diamond and                cubic boron nitride films.  Their previous experience, coupled                  with Professor Tzeng's expertise in the field should provide a                  fruitful collaboration.  It is expected that collaborations                     between the researchers will continue even after the formal                     agreement has terminated.",
