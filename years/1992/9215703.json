 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop and test a theory-             based, quantitative and operationally efficient methodology which               would enable industry to predict, assess and develop the knowledge              and skills required of manufacturing personnel, concurrently with               the design and development of manufacturing technologies.  Specific             techniques will be developed to assess human knowledge, skill and               ability requirements during the manufacturing systems design phase              to improve selection and training of personnel in order that the                personnel can be optimally productive when the technology arrives               at the workplace.                                                                    The conceptual framework for the development of the                        methodology is based on the combined information derived from                   Fleishman's taxonomy of human abilities, Gange's learning                       hierarchy, Anderson's automation of human thought process, Wicken's             cognitive resources and Koubek and Salvendy's knowledge structure               models.  The conceptual model will be operationalized through the               utilization of a computer-based decision flow diagram.  The                     development, experimentation, and validation efforts will be                    performed in cooperation with the private sector (industry).",
