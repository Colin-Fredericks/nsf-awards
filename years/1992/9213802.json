The school will                     consist of a program of graduate level credit courses in beam                   physics and accelerator technology aimed at education of young                  physicists, as well as older physicists in a transition phase                   from other areas of specialty, in the methods of accelerator                    design.  A great National need for such persons presently                       exists.                                                                              These schools have become a very valuable part of the                      particle physics scene in our Nation and the World.                             Accelerator physics is being taught at only a very few                          Universities as well as at some National Laboratories.  The                     accelerator school is held in the Summer, and forms a valuable                  part of the effort required to educate students in the art of                   accelerator design.",
