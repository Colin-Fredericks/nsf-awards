 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a cultural anthropologist in a research                   project in Sri Lanka.  The project will restudy a rural community               of pottery producers who have experienced significant economic                  growth and relative prosperity since the 1970s.  The project will               conduct ethnographic research in producer households and surveys                of local markets, with the goal of relating current economic                    activity to development policy of the past 20 years.                                                                                                            This project is important because Sri Lanka has undergone                       \"structural adjustment\" in response to pressures from                           international development lending agencies.  These policies have                been associated with reports of declining living standards of the               rural poor.  This study of a case of improving conditions of life               will provide ideas and descriptive examples to refine and improve               the theory of economic development under structural adjustment.",
