 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a wide-ranging and detailed                      investigation of cellular automata (CA) models as descriptions of               ecological interactions in space and time.  CA models are                       essentially discretized versions of reaction-diffusion models; they             are closely related to patch-occupancy models for metapopulation                dynamics.  The research program will construct models for                       competition, predation, and predator-mediated coexistence.  It will             extend the usual CA approaches to include substrate heterogeneity               and disturbance size distributions.  The analysis of these models               will include a range of non-spatial or mean-field properties (state             and species frequencies, mean alpha and beta diversities,                       interspecific associations, and turnover rates) as well as                      explicitly spatial methods (fractal dimensions, other scaling                   relationships, and wavelet analysis).  The models will be applied               to a number of specific problems, including the relationship of                 biotic and substrate heterogeneity, the contrast of CA models with              the corresponding spatially averaged patch-occupancy models, and                the conditions required for pattern generation in the ecological                analogs of excitable media.  This research will provide new                     insights into spatial relationships of many basic processes in                  population and community ecology.",
