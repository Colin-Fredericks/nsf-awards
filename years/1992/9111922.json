 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a cultural anthropologist and two                         sociologists in a continuing study of how households in a mid-                  sized Mexican city respond to the continuing economic crisis.                   Previous research dating from 1977 identified a sample of                       households and interviewed them on their social and economic                    activities.  this project will re-interview the households and                  focus on ethnic differences in the city itself, as well as extend               the sample to three secondary center surrounding this regional                  core.  The study will focus on the households as decision-making                bodies trying to adapt to changing and uncertain prospects for                  earning a living.                                                                                                                                               this research is important because it is the first study of a                   Latin American city based on longitudinal survey data combined                  with long-term ethnography.  Understanding the strategies of                    these households will help planners deal with the effects of                    changing macro-level economic policies which create or diminish                 local jobs, which then increase or decrease labor migration form                Mexico into the US.",
