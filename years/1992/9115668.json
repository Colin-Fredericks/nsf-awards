 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational                     Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Stevens will                       develop a method of saccharide conformational analysis from                     chiroptical measurements.  The calculational model relates                      saccharide optical rotation to geometry-dependent interactions                  among bond-localized electronic transitions.  The technique                     will be used in studies of geometry and conformational energy                   of a variety of saccharides including mannose, agarose,                         carrageenan, and subsequently extended to include some                          C-disaccharides.                                                                %%%                                                                             Complex sugars have fundamental biological significance and are                 also useful in technology because of their physical and                         chemical properties.  The ability to predict such properties by                 molecular modeling is developing rapidly, but further develop-                  ment requires guidance by experiment interpreted by advanced                    theoretical methods.  Stevens will develop a procedure for                      interpreting measurements of the rotation of the plane of                       polarized light in terms of the geometrical conformation of the                 sugar molecule responsible for the effect.  The experiments can                 then be more broadly used to evaluate saccharide force fields                   for use in the modeling procedures.",
