 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of volume rendering is increasingly used for a                      wide range of scientific visualization application as well as                   for the generation of complex synthetic scenes.  However, the                   process of viewing which constitutes the most crucial phase in                  rendering is also memory intensive and time consuming.  This                    project investigates new ways to expedite volume viewing by                     exploiting coherency and redundancy in the volume data.                                                                                                         In particular, the objectives of the proposed research are to:                  (1) develop methods to exploit coherency between rays,                          (2) develop methods to exploit coherency between frames,                        (3) develop methods to accelerate ray traversal by utilizing                    the empty space, (4) speed up recursive ray tracing to                          precomputing view independent attributes and partial coverage                   information, and (5) assemble the technology into a rendering                   toolkit that will be used for the construction of application-                  specific volume rendering environments.                                                                                                                         This research is expected to produce a portable rendering                       toolkit delivering faster than ever high quality volume                         rendering.  It is anticipated that the toolkit will find a                      wide use in visualization, education, and graphics.",
