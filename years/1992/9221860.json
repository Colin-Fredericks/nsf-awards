 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meiosis is a complex cellular process that occurs during the sexual             reproduction of all eukayotic organisms including man.  The                     reproduction of meiosis involves the assembly of complex cellular               structures, including the synaptonemal complex, and the spindle.                We are studying two genes required for normal meiosis in                        Drosophila: (1) c(3)G, which is required for the assembly of the                synaptonemal complex, and (2) cand, which encodes a kinesin-like                mechanochemical protein that is required for the assembly of the                spindle.  We have refined the cytogenetic localization of c(3)G in              order to facilitate the isolation of the gene by molecular cloning.             We now propose to isolate the c(3)G locus by chromosome walking,                and use the cloned gene to determine the nature and subcellular                 localization of the gene product by DNA sequencing and antibody                 staining.  We also propose to identify additional genes required                for synaptonemal complex and spindle assembly by screening for                  mutations that display second-site noncomplementation of c(3)G or               cand.                                                                           %%%                                                                             Gametes are formed in sexually reproducing organisms by an                      intricate sequence of two cell division known as meiosis.  During               meiosis special structures are formed in the dividing reproductive              cells which ensure that a precise and compete set of chromosome is              distributed into each gamete.  The cellular structures and                      mechanisms of meiosis are essential for normal reproduction, since              gametes carrying too many or too few chromosomes give rise to                   grossly abnormal or inviable offspring.  The detailed mechanisms of             meiosis are yet poorly understood.  This is a proposal to study                 genes of the fruit fly Drosophila whose products play an essential              role in meiosis.",
