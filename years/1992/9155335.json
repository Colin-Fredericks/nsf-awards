 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACTION PHYSICS is intended to train 60 New York City middle                     school teachers (20 per year for three years) in New York City                  in basic physics concepts.  The training will involve teachers                  in the development and implementation of a series of                            activities which utilize the concepts of sports and dance and                   body movement as the experimental context for learning.  The                    project will strengthen teachers' abilities to use a variety                    of teaching strategies to present physics concepts in this                      motivating framework. The project is a cooperative effort of                    the Center for Advanced Study in Education (CUNY), Brooklyn                     College, CUNY Physics Department, The New York City Board of                    Education, the New York State Education and Research Network                    (NYSERnet), the American Physical Society, the New York                         Academy of Sciences, and The Institute for Schools of the                       Future.                                                                         Participants, who will receive graduate credit for some of the                  coursework taken, will have access to computers in the                          classrooms and will be eligible for a New York City program                     which loans computers to teachers for use in their homes.                       Access to the computers will enable the teachers to                             participate in electronic networking among themselves and with                  scientists associated with the project and with related groups                  and persons who use the NYSERnet and Internet.",
