 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase II project addresses the problems in the quality of                  images transmitted in a computer environment.  A common problem                 is the \"tile effect\" which is introduced by compression of the                  signal for transmission and then decompression for viewing.  The                principal investigator is developing a new algorithm, called the                JPEG/RBC algorithm, which is based on a two source decomposition                derived from a noncausal model for image data and fits closely                  within the framework of the JPEG standard.  A preliminary version               of the algorithm was shown in Phase I to reduce this problem as                 well as the compressed data rate when compared to commonly used                 algorithms.  Potential applications include photo ID systems,                   medical imaging, intelligence and prepress.",
