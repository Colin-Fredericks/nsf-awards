 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop a scientific basis for analyzing               and optimizing fixture configurations in a manner that allows for               the automated design of fixtures during computer aided process                  planning.  The uniqueness of the approach is the inclusion of                   clamping force and the resulting deformation into the optimization              process.  This will be accomplished by abstracting the workpiece                geometry into a finite element model of the part and fixture to                 analyze both the components as they are subjected to clamping                   forces.  The final stage will be the optimization of the                        configuration of the fixture on the basis of an optimization model              that is to be researched and developed as part of this project.                      Designing of fixtures to hold the workpiece during processing              is a critical aspect of process planning and a function that is                 still carried out on an empirical basis.  A scientific approach                 will enable the automation of this process while improving the                  efficiency of the manufacturing sector.",
