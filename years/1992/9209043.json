 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this study is to reevaluate the dating of the                Manson Impact Structure, which has been suggested to be one of the              sites where a large asteroid or comet struck the earth some 65                  million years ago, causing one of the larger mass extinctions                   experienced on this planet.  It is important to determine with the              best possible resolution if the Manson structure is the same age                as other impact sites nominated to be responsible for events at the             Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, and if Manson and the other                 impact sites are the same age as the paleontologically defined                  boundary seen in the rock record.  Up to this point, the only date              on the Manson structure has come from innovative application of the             40Ar/39Ar dating method to samples of partially reset feldspars which           were taken from the basement rock shocked and heated by the impact              itself.  New dating of melt glasses recovered by the current                    drilling program at the Manson site may provide an additional age               estimate, but further analysis of shocked feldspars offers at least             as promising a means of improving the precision and accuracy of                 the age of the Manson of feldspar analysis and interpretation, it               should be possible to bring the precision and accuracy of the age               of the Manson structure.  Currently, this age estimate is 65.7+1                Ma.  With the application of current techniques of feldspar                     analysis and interpretation, it should be possible to bring the                 precision to ~0.2 Ma or better; preliminary \"thermochronological\"               analysis of previously published data also suggests that the most               likely age may actually be at least 0.7 m.y. lower, putting the age             of the Manson impactor much closer to estimates of the K/T boundary             and the Caribbean impactor of some 64.7 Ma.  Additional benefits                from careful thermochronological analysis of Manson-site feldspars              will include an understanding of how robust age estimates from                  these feldspars actually are, and also, a constraint on the post-               impact thermal history of the impact site.",
