 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funds for renovation of                              research space for the Department of Microbiology                               and Immunology (M&I).  The proposed renovation will                             solve numerous problems.  Floors, lighting and                                  finishes will be replaced and numerous code                                     violations eliminated.  Aisle space will be                                     redesigned to facilitate multiple users and                                     interactions or access by the handicapped.                                      Facilities for tissue culture and monoclonal                                    antibody production will be improved for training                               graduate students. The renovated facility will                                  enhance the recruitment of additional faculty and                               graduate students, and the present externally                                   funded research projects of M&I. It will also                                   enhance M&I's appropriate participation in NSF                                  funded outreach programs at the university,                                     including programs to motivate women and minority                               students toward a career in science and to provide                              hands-on training for elementary school teachers in                             the biological sciences.                                                             The renovation stresses open laboratories that                             maximize encounters between groups of researchers.                              This will facilitate mentorism between established,                             funded faculty and incoming new investigators, to                               increase interactions among a small number of                                   faculty to increase scientific cooperation and the                              development of new and exciting areas of research,                              and to accommodate the use of communal laboratory                               equipment.",
