The purpose of the                                   collaboration is to pursue studies concerning the                               environment around the sun.  Among the objectives of                            the research, the investigators intend to obtain                                information on the brightness of the solar corona                               and verify whether the sun has dust rings or a dust                             shell around it.                                                                                                                                                The investigators' experiment will include the                                  launching of a Viper-Class Sounding Rocket from the                             South Atlantic Ocean to observe the forthcoming                                 (June 30, 1992) total solar eclipse.  This is one of                            the longest duration total eclipses of the sun in                               this century.  The rocket will carry scientific                                 instruments built by the U.S. PI with various                                   components from Mexico.  Data from the eclipse will                             be transmitted to the ground and recorded on a                                  memory device for recovery by the U.S. Navy.  The                               experiment will obtain specific information on the                              dynamics of the dust particles orbiting the sun and                             the interaction of the dust with the solar wind.                                This information will help to increase our                                      understanding of the environment around the sun and                             other stars.",
