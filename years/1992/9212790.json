 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests equipment to upgrade the scanning                         tunneling and atomic force microscopic capabilities in the                      PI's laboratory.  The PI currently possesses a Nanoscope II                     AFM/STM.  He proposes to construct a sealed chamber to contain                  the instrument that will allow constant temperature control,                    and will permit experiments to be undertaken at low vacuum and                  under a clean gas such as nitrogen or at a fixed humidity.  He                  also proposes to upgrade the Nanoscope II AFM/STM to a                          Nanoscope III; the upgrade instrument will allow for a larger                   scanning field while still maintaining excellent molecular                      resolution, and will also allow for the measurement of                          frictional forces as well as normal forces at the cantilever                    tip.  The PI also requests funds for the purchase of a image                    analysis system independent of the Nanoscope software which                     will enhance the visual inspection of images, and will enable                   better quantification of structure characteristics such as                      periodicity.                                                                                                                                                    The PI uses the AFM/STM apparatus primarily to image self                       assembled monolayer and bilayers of amphiphillic molecules at                   fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces with nanometer scale                     resolution.  The research activity of the PI in this area is                    of the highest quality, he has produced several notable                         achievements such as the identification of a ripple phase for                   the biological surfactant DMPC.  The fundamental imaging                        studies of bilayers and monolayers will lead to a better                        understanding of the relationship between the chemical                          structure of an amphophil and the structures it forms in self                   assembly.  This information is of importance in cell membrane                   research, and in the research on the technological                              applications of Langmuir-Blodgett films.  The upgrade for the                   existing equipment will significantly improve the quality and                   reproducability of the PI's studies.  With the environmental                    control upgrade, experiments in clean atmospheres can be                        undertaken which will remove capillary force effects arising                    from pendular bridges which can form at the cantilever tip.",
