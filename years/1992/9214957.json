 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of four                                  freshman/sophomore courses for computer science majors and                      non-majors.  The courses will teach multiple programming                        paradigms, introduce formal reasoning early in the curriculum,                  and exploit computational problems that arise in other                          disciplines.  Course material will be made available to other                   academic institutions and results of the educational effort                     will be presented at professional meetings and conferences.                                                                                                     Cornell University plans to develop four introductory/                          sophomore level courses for computer science majors and non-                    majors.  One course, targeted at students with no previous                      programming experience, will focus on developing the students'                  general problem-solving skills as well as their ability to use                  notation and abstract thinking.  The other three courses are                    alternative courses for audiences with some background in                       computer science.  These courses will provide a formal                          introduction to functional programming and formal reasoning,                    as well as continued instruction in imperative programming.                     Course materials will be disseminated to other academic                         institutions and presentations will be made at professional                     meetings and conferences.",
