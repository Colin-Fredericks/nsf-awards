 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal is a request to the NSF to assist in                       equipping research facilities for the evolutionary biology                      program at Yale University.  The six principal investigators on                 this proposal represent a diversity of research programs yet with               common research strategies that make it very effective to share                 common facilities.  The overall theme of the research is to                     understand evolutionary mechanisms as they apply to molecular                   cellular, and developmental system.  The major pieces of                        equipment to be purchased are an oligonucleotide synthesizer for                synthesis of primers for DNA sequencing, an automated DNA                       sequencer, a computerized analytic system for acquisition and                   analysis of molecular data, especially DNA sequence data, a                     microscopic video computer system to allow analysis of still and                motion images, and centrifuges and a scintillation counter.  In                 addition to solely research purposes, the new facilities will                   serve as training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,               as well as visiting scientists, in the most modern approaches to                evolutionary questions.",
