 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses substantial resources on a small set of                    highly capable first-year students to inspire a greater                         fraction of them to pursue research careers in science and                      engineering.  Chemistry is the ideal course for this because                    most science and engineering majors take it in their first                      year; physics and engineering courses begin later.  In 1990-91,                 we developed an intensive first-year chemistry course for 40 of                 the very best new students in a class of 5000.  The course                      introduces state-of-the-art chemical thought as early and as                    often as possible.  The cornerstone of the course is the Spring                 research project, in which pairs of students engage in hands-on                 research in the laboratories of chemistry professors.  Student                  response to the course was overwhelmingly positive.  Eleven of                  the 25 students who participated planned to continue research                   projects this Fall.  This project will enhance the research                     experience and the laboratories.  This model course may                         convince other universities to focus more resources on the very                 best science and engineering students in the critical first                     year.",
