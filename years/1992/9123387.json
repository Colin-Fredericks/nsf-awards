 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gross will continue his study of noncommutative harmonic                   analysis.  This will include an investigation of generalized                    hypergeometric functions on matrix spaces, domains of positivity,               and Hermitian symmetric spaces, concentrating on developing the                 operator-valued theory, extending the context to include Siegel                 domains of type II, deriving Mellin-Barnes representations, and                 exploring applications to infinite-dimensional representation                   theory.                                                                              The mathematical bedrock of Gross's research is the theory                 of Lie groups.  Named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician                   Sophus Lie, these groups have been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.DMS-9200774                           Gross                                                                                Gross will investigate the natural Dirichlet form operator                 over loop spaces associated to Brownian bridge measure.  The                    particular interest is in proving existence and uniqueness of                   ground states of the associated Schroedinger operators over                     homotopy classes.  This is a continuation of Gross's recent work                on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on loop groups which has many               implications for the representation theory of Lie groups.                            The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially                     quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
