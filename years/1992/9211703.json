 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air-borne particles are an important and complex component of              the atmospheric.  Particles act as sites for water vapor                        condensation and thus are involved in the formation of clouds and               influence the properties of clouds.  The long range objective of                this research is to determine the role and interplay of chemical                constituents, such as sulfate and organic compounds, in modifying               the composition of particles and their ability to form cloud                    droplets.  A better comprehension of these interactions is required             in order to understand the effect on aerosols and clouds of natural             and anthropogenic emissions that contribute particulate matter to               the atmospheric.  The immediate objective of this work is to                    establish a foundation by investigating heterogeneous nucleation on             single well characterized particles.  The experimental approach                 entails electroactive levitation of individual particles in a                   thermal diffusion chamber which allows for examination and                      unsaturated to supersaturated conditions.  Spectroscopic methods,               voltage balancing techniques, and measurement of nucleation rates               and thresholds are used to characterize the particles.",
