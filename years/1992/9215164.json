 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic radicals will be prepared in the gas phase and the                      corresponding infrared absorption spectra recorded.  In a                       separate set of experiments, utilizing a flowing afterglow                      apparatus, the reactivity of hydrocarbon radicals in the gas                    phase with negative ions will be investigated.  Gas phase                       species to be generated and studied include methyl, vinyl,                      allyl, allene, phenyl, and benzyl radicals.  The radicals will                  be produced via a pyrolysis supersonic jet with a high                          temperature nozzle.  A photoionization mass spectrometer will                   be employed to follow the pyrolysis effluent at the head of a                   zirconia nozzle.                                                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports an                        investigation of radicals and biradicals and their reactions                    with a variety of species in the gas phase under the direction                  of Professor G. B. Ellison at the University of Colorado.  Some                 of the most reactive species produced during the course of many                 chemical transformations are radicals, which contain one                        unpaired electron, and biradicals, which contain two unpaired                   electrons.   Whereas most of the previous work with organic                     radicals involved reactions in liquid solutions,  Professor                     Ellison will generate reactive radical species in the gas phase                 with a high temperature nozzle.  The radicals will be exposed                   to a stream of charged gas phase molecules and the chemical                     subsequent chemical transformations observed directly.                          Comparison of the experimental results with computer                            simulations will lead to a better understanding of the                          reactions of radicals and biradicals.",
