 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stein and                         colleagues will curate large archeological collections which                    derive from sites in the Lower Columbia River area of Washington                State. The region from which the controlled excavations were                    conducted is now inundated as the result of dam construction and                the collections therefore constitute a unique resource. The                     materials include not only lithic artifacts, but also faunal                    remains and soil samples which permit environmental                             reconstruction. The material is presently stored in cardboard                   trays and cardboard curation boxes. The trays are open and                      bending under the weight of their own contents. Within trays                    artifacts are piled in open containers with large numbers of                    lithics stored together. Materials, including excavation notes                  are jumbled together.                                                                                                                                           Dr. Stein and colleagues will take these materials from their                   paper and cardboard containers, clean them, place them in                       archival-quality plastic bags with labels, catalog them using a                 computer cataloging program (ARGUS) and place them in enameled-                 metal specimen cabinets. Federal funds will compliment those                    provided by the University of Washington.                                                                                                                       This project is important for several reasons. Native American                  groups in the Northwest region reached a level of cultural                      complexity unique among hunting and gathering peoples and                       anthropologists wish to understand how societies could be                       sustained on such a subsistence base. It is also clear that                     interaction occurred between coastal and inland groups but the                  intensity and effect of these contacts are not known. The Lower                 Columbia River sites provide crucial data to answer this                        question. These collections constitute not only a part of                       America's cultural heritage but also important scientific data                  which are virtually unusable at the present time. This project                  will help to remedy this situation.",
