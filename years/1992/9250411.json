 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the laboratory/classroom in use here, the students (pre-                     service and in-service teachers) have before them the entire                    course content from the first day of class.  In hypertext form                  guided by concept maps, the student are able to freely navigate                 through the course material and use the aids there to do                        numerical calculations, examine illustrations and simulations,                  and of course find discussion of the relevant concepts.  The                    HyperCard stacks on a Macintosh computer are projected on a                     screen to form the basis for lecture and discussion in the                      class, enabling the student to have the same illustrations and                  calculations in front of them.  With two students to a machine,                 class members choose to follow along or do independent                          calculations or explorations, knowing they are able to merge                    back with the track of the lecturer at any time.  Laboratory                    exercises are integrated as a part of almost every session, and                 the versatile laboratory interface plus spreadsheet and                         graphics software allow the students to analyze and present                     data in an atmosphere typical of modern research facilities.                    The HyperCard knowledge base is accessible to the student at                    any point during the laboratory, containing not only detailed                   information about lab equipment and procedure, but also links                   to the classroom material for review of concepts.  This project                 has equipped the multimedia laboratory classroom needed to                      implement this instructional strategy on a pilot basis with                     this target group and to lay the base for expanding this                        approach to other undergraduate courses.",
