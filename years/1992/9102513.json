Properties of              the well-founded semantics for (possibly) unstratified knowledge                bases are investigated for the purpose of implementing this                     semantics on a wide class of practical logic programs and expert                systems.  This project continues development of algorithms for                  automatically recognizing sets of rules that can be guaranteed to               terminate with the appropriate execution strategy. The project also             studies methods by which the compiler can optimize execution by                 discovery of determinacy in the rules. In the presence of                       determinacy, the correct choice among alternatives can always be                made immediately, making backtracking unnecessary. The study                    focuses on the use of mode information and inductive type                       definitions.  This project  continues implementation of prototype               analyzers, compilers, and interpreters, building upon and extending             algorithms and software developed during prior research. A major                difficulty today in building large-scale rule-based systems is                  choosing effective control strategies for the various subsets of                rules, and current systems place virtually all of this burden on                the programmer.  An inferior choice can easily produce a                        nonterminating or extremely inefficient system. Progress in this                research will facilitate the development of tools that                          automatically choose effective control strategies in most cases,                and advise the programmer of unclear cases.",
