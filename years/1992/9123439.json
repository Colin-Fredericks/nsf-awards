 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the improvement of the insect                      collections at Ohio State, in conjunction with OSU's development of             a \"Museum of Biological Diversity\", a renovated facility to house               its biological collections.  The OSU insect collection, with about              3.5 million specimens and over 2500 primary types, is the 14th                  largest in North America and fifth largest among those at                       U.S. universities.  Geographic coverage is worldwide; taxonomic                 strengths are the Homoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera.               The collection, now scattered among five rooms, will be consolidated            in the new facility in a climate controlled area that is twice as               large as the current collection area, thus allowing for future                  growth.  New cabinets will alleviate current crowding, allow for                expansion and will replace wooden cabinets, which are inadequate for            housing the collection or protecting it against pests.                          Institutional commitments include provision of the new collection               area and a promise to make a collection manager position permanent              after the expiration of the project.  These collections are an                  extremely important, international resource for systematic,                     biodiversity and ecological studies on arthropods, and play a strong            role in the training of students in entomological research.                     This project will make the OSU collection more accessible to the                scientific community and further its use in research and education              on the biology of insects.",
