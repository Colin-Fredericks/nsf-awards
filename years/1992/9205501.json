 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ongoing collision of the Indian subcontinent with southern             Asia has produced the Himalayan Range and the Tibetan Plateau; the              highest present-day topography on the earth's surface.  Decades of              structural studies have documented large amounts of shortening                  within the Himalaya, and more recent isotopic studies have begun                to delineate the history of uplift during this shortening.  Large               amounts of erosional and tectonic denudation are required to                    reconcile the calculated crustal uplift with the present                        topography.  This denudation has caused a massive sediment flux                 from the hinterland into the basins bounding the Himalaya:  the                 Indo-Gangetic foreland, the Tarim basin, the Indus Cone, and the                Bengal Fan.  The research proposed here will attempt to examine                 this sediment flux to the south of the Himalaya in order to                     determine: 1) how much and at what rates sediment has been stored               in the past within the potential sediment sinks bounding the                    southern margin of the Himalaya; 2) the presence or absence of                  synchronous changes in the rates of sediment storage between the                foreland and the marine fan systems and within different parts of               the foreland (partitioning of the sediment load); 3) modern rates               of sediment delivery out of the hinterland for a major and minor                river that debouch into the Himalayan foreland in northern                      Pakistan; 4) an estimate of the amount of sediment storage that                 occurs within the hinterland itself and a comparison of the                     relative storage in monsoonal dominated versus semi-arid,                       nonmonsoonal drainages; and 5) volumetric approximations based on               digital elevation data of erosional losses within selected parts                of the uplifted hinterland.",
