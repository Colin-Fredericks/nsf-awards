 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase I of a National School Network Testbed will test the                      feasibility of a model for elementary and secondary school                      participation in internetworking.  This model makes available                   current scientific resources, engages students and teachers in                  authentic problem-solving, supports teachers in classroom                       innovation, and supports the implementation of advances in pedagogy             and educational technology.  The Phase I Testbed brings together a              number of projects that have already begun to use networking, from              simple email applications to distributed databases and multi-user               simulations.  BBN-developed technology will provide a uniform                   infrastructure for this range of applications.  Collaborating                   institutions will supply support, training, and study of usage.                 The testbed research addresses the trade-off between the                        educational value and cost of the technology.  Can the                          technology bring educational benefits sufficient to attract                     large scale investment by local, state, and federal                             agencies, as well as industry?  Can it be implemented in a                      robust, supportable form with low entry-level costs?                                                                                                            The K-12 server and BBN/MacEMail software supply file,                          electronic mail, database, news/bulletin board, and other                       communications-based services to classroom desktop                              computers.  The server can operate at a national, regional,                     district or within-school level.  School computers connect                      over local and wide area networks using TCP/IP, the standard                    protocol for the Internet, instead of the currently common                      asynchronous terminal connections to a host computer.  A key                    component of the project involves the design and development                    of standard mechanisms that allow educational software                          programs to take advantage of email, database, and other                        services on the network server by invisibly establishing the                    underlying connection between the desktop computer and the                      server.",
