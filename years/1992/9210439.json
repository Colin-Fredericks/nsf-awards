 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with data reduction and general                      visualization techniques for scalar-valued 3D data sets.  Many                  practical applications deal with 3D data sets where points in                   space, with associated function values, are given.  Such data                   sets occur in medicine (tomography), geosciences and physical                   sciences (temperature, pressure, radiation), and several other                  sciences and disciplines of engineering measurements or                         mathematical simulations.  Generally, such data sets are huge,                  aggravating the tasks of data storage, interactive data                         manipulation, and real-time data visualization.                                                                                                                 Discrete scalar-valued data sets can be reduced by considering                  derivative information at the given data points.  Curvature                     information of graphs of functions locally approximating the data               can be used to define a measure of the significance of single                   data points can be weighted and removed iteratively form the 3D                 point set.  The proposed methods for 3D points, and 3D                          retriangulation strategies.  The result of reduction algorithm is               a data set consisting of scattered 3D points and an associated                  triangulation (tetrahedra).                                                                                                                                     Common visualization techniques require structured data sets,                   points typically being organized in a rectilinear (\"cuberille\")                 grid.  This research will introduce visualization methodologies                 allowing discretized scalar fields, with arbitrarily located data               points, to be rendered.",
