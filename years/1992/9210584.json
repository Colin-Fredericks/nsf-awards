 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to examine the role of regulation of gene                      expression by progestins, and to determine the importance of a                  third class of progesterone receptor protein (progesterone receptor             protein C) interactions with two previously identified receptors.               The progesterone receptor C may have a negative regulatory effect               on receptors of the A or B class, by combining with them and then               reducing their responses to progestins. The C receptor protein                  appears to be missing one of the two zinc fingers possessed by the              A and B proteins, but contains other features of these proteins,                allowing mixed dimers to form. The start site of transcription will             be determined; a putative site (met 595) has been identified by the             P.I., but needs to be further characterized.                                    %%%                                                                             Progesterone is a steroid hormone which binds to intracellular                  receptors and affects gene expression in both males and females.                The mechanism of this regulation is not known. Two types of                     receptor have been described; this proposal deals with a third                  type, which may have a negative interaction with the first two                  types. Its production from cDNA and its interactions with the A and             B class of progestin receptors will be investigated.",
