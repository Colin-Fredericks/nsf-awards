 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers University will conduct a three-and-one-half-year                       project to enhance 340 K through 12 mathematics teachers in                     discrete mathematics and its applications.  In addition,                        approximately 3400 second-wave teachers will receive                            inservice from participants, for a total of over 3700                           teachers enhanced through this project.                                                                                                                         Three cycles of teachers will attend a three-week summer                        institute, four follow-up sessions during the school year                       and a second summer institute.  For high school and middle                      school mathematics teachers, the second summer institute                        will be two weeks in length; for middle and elementary                          mathematics specialists, the second summer institute will be                    one week long.  Approximately 115 teachers will participate                     in each two-year cycle.  In addition twenty participants                        will be selected each year to attend a seven-day leadership                     training program and will then be expected to work in teams                     of two to provide four inservice workshops in their school                      districts the following year.  Discrete mathematics topics                      will include applications of graphs; graphs and algorithms;                     combinatorics, probability and statistics; mathematical                         formulations and fairness; discrete dynamical systems; and                      iteration and fractals.  Participants may earn up to six                        graduate credits.                                                                                                                                               This project is co-sponsored by the Center for Discrete                         Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS), an                       NSF Science and Technology Center made up of a consortium of                    Rutgers and Princeton Universities, AT&T Bell Laboratories,                     and Bell Communications Research.  This group is at the                         cutting edge of discrete mathematics, offering the                              excitement of prominent researchers in the field, many of                       whom are also excellent at communicating their mathematics                      to non-researchers.                                                                                                                                             Rutgers University, Montclair State College, Bellcore and                       Bell Labs cost-sharing accounts for 28% of the NSF budget.",
