 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) is one the most widely                 recognized biological features in the ocean, however, a mechanistic             understanding of the dynamics processes leading to its formation                and maintenance has not been fully accepted.  Under the common                  assumption that marine grazers are food-limited and that                        phytoplankton in the SCM are light-limited, one simple question has             remained particularly puzzling - why isn't the SCM grazed away?                 Based on new results, we hypothesize that 1) growth and loss                    processes are not uniform among the algal taxa represented in the               SCM, 2) some algal groups, small unicellular algae, are indeed                  better adapted to the low light conditions of the SCM than other                algal taxa and 3) functional feeding responses of resident                      micrograzers operate to maintain the SCM as a persistent feature.               The project initiates new taxon-specific experiments that focus on              the dynamics of phytoplankton growth, herbivorous grazing and cell              sinking in the SCM.  Taxon-specific rates will be determined from               corroborative methods which exploit algal pigments as                           chemotaxonomic markers.  Our goal is to develop a taxon-specific                understanding of rate processes that control the formation and                  maintenance of the oceanic SCM.",
