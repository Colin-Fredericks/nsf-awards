The materials will be designed to supplement                         existing secondary mathematics classes and will include                         student work pages, computer exercises, cooperative learning                    projects and a video tape informing students of the important                   role of mathematics in agriculture.  Some material will be                      written to include parental involvement.                                                                                                                        The materials will be based on information gathered from                        practicing agriculture professionals in eastern Washington and                  will be piloted in six districts.  Additional teachers will be                  trained to use the materials during a one-weak conference and                   through courses taught at the three branch campuses of                          Washington State University.  A  communicating network of 80-                   100 teachers will result which will help address problems of                    isolation in rural districts.",
