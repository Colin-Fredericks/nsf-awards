 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award focuses on theoretical aspects of commutative                   algebra and seeks to make use of them to break the logjam of                    complexity in several problems of computational algebra.  The                   principal investigator will: (a) extend the role of Koszul                      homology in the structure theory of Cohen-Macaulay singularities,               (b) investigate the structure of algebras of linear type, (c)                   examine the equations of Rees algebras of various kinds, (d)                    study the invariants and singularities of commuting varieties of                Lie algebras and their representations, and (e) exploit some                    novel means of converting graph-theoretic data into                             ideal-theoretic structures.  Concomitantly, he will investigate                 roles for the recent discovery of closed formulas for computing                 radicals, equi-dimensional decompositions and a method to compute               normalization that is free of generic projections, with                         accompanying algorithms, in the development of                                  algebraic/numerical equation solvers.                                                This project is in the general area of commutative algebra                 and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field.                     There is a growing interest in using computers to answer                        theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite               useful for the development of algorithms.  This project makes                   serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic                         calculations to solve real problems in commutative algebra.",
