 "awd_abstract_narration": "A lidar system developed at the University of Maryland is                  being restored to operation at Utah State University, as part of                the Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) facilities - a mid-latitude CEDAR               observatory.  Lidar observations will be made initially in the                  altitude range 30-70 km, as done previously at College Park,                    covering the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere.  The altitude             coverage will be extended with the addition of a more powerful                  laser by Clemson University upward to 80 km.  At higher altitudes,              near the mesopause, these lidar observations will be complemented               by the passive optical instruments at BLO.  Vertical profiles of                molecular density and temperature will be derived from clear-air                portions of the atmosphere above 30 km, using Rayleigh scattering               at 532 nm.  The downward extension of these profiles into regions               were Mie (particulate) scattering significantly adds to the lidar               return will employ Raman scattering from atmospheric molecules.                 These profiles will be used to examine the occurrence, structure,               interaction, and variability of planetary waves, tides, and gravity             waves in the middle atmosphere above an extended mountainous                    region.  This award provides funds for the PI to help make the                  system operational at BLO, and begin measurements.",
