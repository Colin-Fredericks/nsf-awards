 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emission of volatile organic components (VOCs) from curing                  inks, films and coatings is a leading cause of atmospheric                      pollution.  Volatile organic solvents have traditionally been                   used to impart desirable viscosity and cure rate properties to                  ink and coating formulations.  An ink or coating formulation                    must be sufficiently fluid to be easily applied (often onto a                   rapidly moving substrate through a series of transfer                           rollers), but must cure rapidly to a hard film.  Historically,                  these processing demands have been met through the use of a                     rapidly evaporating organic solvent in the ink and coating                      formulations.  When these volatile organic solvents enter the                   atmosphere, they result in the formation of smog and air                        pollution.  There is a need for the development of high                         performance inks and coatings that will not emit VOCs to the                    atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                     Cationic photopolymerizations of diepoxides and bisvinyl                        ethers exhibit potential for the development of high-                           performance inks and coatings which emit no VOCs during cure.                   However, because appropriate monomers and initiators have been                  developed only recently, the characteristics of these                           reactions and the structure of the resulting polymer films are                  not well understood.  This research project will provide                        fundamental experimental and theoretical investigations of UV-                  initiated cationic photopolymerizations.  Detailed profiles of                  the reaction temperature and the extent of reaction will be                     obtained using in situ time-resolved fluorescence and raman                     experiments, and the thermal, mechanical, and physical                          properties of the resulting highly crosslinked polymer films                    will be thoroughly characterized.  Nuclear magnetic resonance                   spin diffusion experiments will be used to investigate the                      homogeneity and morphology of the polymer films.  The goal of                   the theoretical effort is to develop computer simulations of                    the photopolymerization reactions which account for molecular                   mobility in a realistic manner.  These simulations should                       provide insight into the development of the highly crosslinked                  network structure.  The research will help evaluate the                         potential of these reactions for the development of high-                       performance, solvent-free inks and coatings.",
