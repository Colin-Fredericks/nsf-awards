 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jordan Hall, the building currently housing                                the Department of Biology at Indiana University,                                is in need of renovation in order to support                                    modern biological research.  Jordan Hall consists                               of an original structure built in 1954 and a new                                addition completed in 1984.  While the new portion                              of the building currently provides researchers                                  with excellent research facilities, many parts of                               the original structure have never been renovated                                and are in need of upgrading. The Department of                                 Biology is vigorously committed to pursuing                                     research and to training graduate students and                                  post-doctoral associates.  External funding in                                  excess of $8 million/year in direct costs funds a                               wide array of research projects and supports the                                majority of graduate students, postdoctorals, and                               even many undergraduates.  The department's                                     established commitment to research, research                                    training, and to attracting minorities and women                                can be clearly documented.  It is imperative to                                 complement this commitment to research with                                     attention to the physical support systems                                       available to the researchers in the department.",
