 "awd_abstract_narration": "To produce the dramatic increases in computer system                            performance needed to solve the \"grand challenge\"                               computational problems, it will be necessary to incorporate                     more parallel processing technology into new computer designs.                                                                                                  A major impediment to achieving high performance in a                           multiprocessor, however, is the delay encountered when                          accessing the data memory.  Current techniques for reducing                     the memory delay, such as data prefetching, vector memory                       fetches, and private data caches, have not been as effective                    in multiprocessors as in traditional uniprocessors because                      they have failed to use all of the available information.  In                   particular, these techniques  typically rely only on the                        information available at run-time, which is insufficient in                     the complex environment of a multiprocessor system.  The                        primary objective of this research project is to develop and                    analyze new techniques for improving multiprocessor memory                      performance by integrating hardware and software strategies to                  utilize all of the memory referencing information.  The                         project will explore both semantic information at compile-time                  and dynamic information at run-time to improve data                             prefetching, processor scheduling, data placement, and cache                    coherence enforcement.  The new techniques generated through                    this research will be validated using a unique combination of                   trace-driven simulations, mathematical models, software                         prototypes running on actual parallel machines, and                             implementation of new algorithms in a parallelizing compiler.",
