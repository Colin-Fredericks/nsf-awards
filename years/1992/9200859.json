 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identity and ethnicity are real dimensions of the social                   world, but their content and construction are often misunderstood.              Elucidation of the manifestation, if any, and the basis of an                   individual's identity with a group can provide understanding of the             process by which one becomes aware of one's ethnicity.  This                    doctoral dissertation project will investigate the reality of                   Appalachian identity among individuals living in Appalachia and                 individuals living in the urban Midwest but originating from the                Appalachian region by means of in-depth interviews beginning with               a purposive sample and shifting to a theoretical sample as                      information is accrued.  The study hypothesizes that Appalachian                identity is based on an individual's awareness of the particular                definitions and devaluation of people from the Central Appalachian              region by mainstream American society.  This identity is a response             to negative stereotypes and may also be a response to feelings of               being discriminated against on the basis of regional origin.                                                                                                         This project will contribute to the scientific understanding               of social relationships and the link between individual and                     society.  It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                   promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research             skills.",
