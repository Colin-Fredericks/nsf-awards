 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new hot press will to be used to fabricate ceramic samples                 with microdesigned interfacial defect structures.  The hot press is             capable of reaching a temperature of at least 1600 C, at pressures              as low as 10_3-10-4, at a rate of about 1-2 C/min.  It would be                 housed in the Ceramics Research Laboratory, within the Department               of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering.  The research                     programs most affected involve a method of combining photolitho-                graphic techniques with ion beam etching and hot pressing to                    produce microdesigned interface structures.  The method allows                  model experiments investigating high-temperature crack healing,                 pore boundary interaciton, pore drag, pore coarsening, and pore                 elimination and network evolution during sintering.  Examples                   of projects underway by faculty members include applications of                 microdesigned interfaces to crack healing studies and pore-boundary             interactions in ceramic materials, ceramic-ceramic joining,                     ceramic-metal interface studies, whose research projects include                sintering studies.  Collaborative research topics with scientists               at other universities and industry include fracture behavior of                 ceramic-metal interfaces, creep cavitation, segregation to internal             cavity surfaces, vapor phase growth of single crystal whiskers, and             NDE.  About 12 graduate students are working with the faculty                   members directly and several undergraduates.",
