 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  Program, will develop the technique of Near Field Scanning                      Optical Microscopy for the characterization of the surface                      structure and chemistry of \"soft\" material surfaces.  In                        addition to work on problems of instrument development,                         calibration of the scanning optical microscopy methodology will                 be carried out.  Application of the method to a number of                       problems involving biological interfaces, membranes, and                        organic monolayers will be pursued.  The development of a                       microscopic technique which can provide very high resolution                    structural information on these difficult surfaces, in                          combination with spatially resolved spectroscopic and chemical                  information, will have a very wide impact in the field of                       surface analysis and characterization.                                          %%%                                                                             The ability to characterize the structure of the surfaces of                    biological and macromolecular samples is crucial to the                         understanding of membrane processes and polymer properties.                     The research being carried out in this project will develop a                   promising new technique for the structural characterization of                  these \"soft\" material surfaces.  This scanning optical                          microscopy method will have a great impact on the understanding                 of this important class of materials.",
