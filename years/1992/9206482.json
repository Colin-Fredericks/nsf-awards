 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the role of protein-protein                            interactions in the function of the v-Src and v-Abl tyrosine                    kinases.  It has been suggested that the Src homology (SH)                      regions 2 and 3 of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are important                   both in the regulation of kinase activity and in the                            recognition of cellular substrates.  Regions of v-Src and v-Abl                 which are involved in intra-or-intermolecular recognition will                  be identified by peptide-based photoaffinity labelling                          experiments.  Modified regions inside and outside the SH2 and                   SH3 domains will be studied further by site-directed,                           mutagenesis and the mutant enzymes will be tested by in vitro                   phosphorylation with tyrosine-containing synthetic peptides.                    These results will be correlated with a model of the three-                     dimensional structure of v-Src based on the recent crystal                      structure of the catalytic domain of the cAMP-dependent protein                 kinase.  Finally, to identify determinants in protein                           substrates for v-Src which confer recognition by the enzyme,                    synthetic peptide \"libraries\" will be used to select those                      peptides which give maximal phosphorylation by v-Src.  The goal                 of these studies is to describe at a molecular level the steps                  leading to the formation of the \"signalling complexes\" which                    play a central role in signal transduction and oncogenic                        transformation.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This research involves the role of certain regions of a protein                 in its ability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of other                      proteins.  These regions may be important for its biological                    activity. These regions will be identified by chemical labelling                and genetic experiments. These results will be correlated with a                model of the three-dimensional structure of protein based on the                recent crystal structure of a similar enzyme. Lastly, special                   substrates for the enzyme will be prepared by random substitution               of a variety of amino acids for the particular one found in a                   peptide which the protein phosphorylates.  This will be used to                 describe structural features of substrates recognized by the                    modifying protein.",
