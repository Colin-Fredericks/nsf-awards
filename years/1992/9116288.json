 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research has demonstrated the widespread occurrence of                 microbially mediated aerobic and anaerobic diagenesis within                    marine carbonate frameworks such as coral reefs.  In these                      sedimentary systems, advective and turbulent water flow, rather                 than diffusion, dominates the exchange of dissolved material                    between the framework interstitial water and the overlying                      seawater.  Nevertheless, diagenesis is rapid enough to result in                elevated concentrations of end products such as inorganic                       nutrients and H2S.  The overall fluxes of diagenetic end products               from a reef framework to the neighboring environment will be                    determined.  Work will be done to 1) extend the spatial scale of                the interstitial water sampling at Checker Reef, Oahu to examine                in detail the upper 1 m of the reef framework; 2) directly                      measure the advective and diffusive fluxes of diagenetic                        reactants and products between the reef framework and the                       surrounding environment at several points across the reef; 3)                   collect data to calibrate a hydrological model of the advection                 of interstitial water within the reef; 4) continue measurements                 of the spatial and temporal distribution or inorganic and organic               diagenetic reactants/products within the reef, with particular                  attention to short-chain organic nitrogen compounds; and 5) use                 the concentration data from item 4) with the hydrological model                 to estimate the rates of organic and inorganic diagenetic                       reactions occurring within the reef framework.",
