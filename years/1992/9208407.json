 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is a generalized harmonic analysis               involving orthogonal functions on sets in higher dimensional                    Euclidean space.  The novel feature of the research is that the                 sets under consideration do not form a group.  This lack of                     algebraic structure can often be compensated for by the existence               of an adequate algebraic structure in the measure algebra                       supported on the set.  The structures under consideration here                  are referred to as hypergroups in which the algebraic operation                 is convolution.  If the elements of a basis of orthogonal                       functions act as homomorphisms of the hypergroup, then one gets a               viable mathematical structure.  For example, the initial one-                   dimensional work in the area used eigenfunctions of a Sturm-                    Liouville problem as a basis.  The current project seeks to                     extend existing structure theorems for compact one-dimensional                  hypergroups to the non-compact case.  Other work will focus on                  characterizing the compactly supported hypergroups in higher                    dimensions, developing a harmonic analysis of the disk                          polynomials and the spheroidal wave functions and analyzing the                 structure of specific families of non-hypergroup measure                        algebras.                                                                            The hypergroup concept, abstract as it is, has its roots in                probability theory, orthogonal polynomials and the theory of                    special functions.  Particular applications include the explicit                representations for annular spheroidal wave functions even though               the functions cannot be given in closed form and the development                of hypergroup interpretations of characteristic functions in                    probability theory.",
