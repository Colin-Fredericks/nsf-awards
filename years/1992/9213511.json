 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this three-year project is to conduct                a participant observation study that examines the changing                      identities of undergraduate engineering students as they                        transform themselves from novice freshmen into graduating seniors               prepared for employment or advanced training.  The major product                is a book length manuscript co-authored by the three members of                 the research team.  With guidance from a panel of consulting                    advisers, the authors will provide a step-by-step account of how                engineering students understand and experience their education as               a sequence of value choices and judgments to be made as they move               through their engineering curricula.  A guiding hypothesis is                   that the high value engineering curricula place on the calculus                 based engineering sciences as the foundation of engineering                     problem solving is linked to the establishment of other social                  dimensions of engineering identities, and to under-representation               of women and minority students.  A second objective is to make                  available to other researchers approximately 2,500 pages of                     indexed transcriptions from taped focus group meetings and                      interviews with undergraduate engineering students at a large                   land-grant university.  Finally, by providing a longitudinal                    account built upon data from transcriptions, participant                        observation, surveys, and document collection, this study will                  make a unique and much-needed contribution to our analytic                      understanding of the character and problems of engineering                      curricula.",
