 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most current architectures have one of two large registers                organizing, either a register stacks, or a large sized single register          sets.  A single register set excels over a stack if a program                   requires frequent access to globals.  A register stack performs                 better if deep recursive chains exist.  It is generally agreed that             neither organization will benefit programs written in a concurrent              language because of the heavy context switch overhead.  In this                 research a register hardware organization called \"threaded                      windows\" is examined to enhance the performance of concurrent                   systems, and sequential programs.  The organization allows the                  registers to be dynamically restructured to either of the above                 forms, and any combination of the above forms.  This permits the                compiler, or the programmer, to capitalize upon each register                   organization's strong points and avoid their weak points.  In                   addition, hardware fault tolerance is facilitated, as well as graceful          runtime fault detection and recovery.  This work will also explore              the applications of this register configuration to programming                  paradigms such as object oriented languages, functional                         languages, and logic languages.                                                       This project proposes a study of a new approach in                        designing register organization for high performance computer                   systems.  It takes into account several recent developments in                  computer architectural design which can tackle the memory                       latency problem in such high performance systems.                                     The effort furthers VPW program objectives to provide                     opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    teaching an undergraduate course, and jointly teaching a second                 year graduate course; doing a colloquial presentation; involving                students in research; serving on the Women and Engineering                      Program Faculty Advisory Board and and being involved in WIE's                  annual conference; participating in informal discussion groups;                 and mentoring students, especially those with career interruptions.",
