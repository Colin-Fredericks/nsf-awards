 "awd_abstract_narration": "A strong need exists for more inclusion of hands-on                             investigative science in the high school curriculum.                            Current school budgets, however, often lack of money to                         purchase adequate materials and equipment for hands-on                          science.                                                                                                                                                        One immediate remedy for the problem is the production and                      dissemination of a laboratory manual of effective hands-on                      investigative activities that require little or no money to                     implement.  The National Association of Biology Teachers                        (NABT) staff plans to recruit excellent, experienced high                       school teachers to write and field test these activities,                       modifying them as needed for special populations of                             students, including the physically disabled, gifted, and                        disadvantaged.  NABT staff members will oversee all phases                      of the project, and biologists and science educators will                       review materials to assure their quality.  The most                             successful activities will then be distributed to high                          school biology teachers throughout the country through                          mailings and in-service workshops.                                                                                                                              The goal of the project is to increase the teaching of                          biology as a process rather than as a collection of facts.                      The objectives of the project are to enable the teaching of                     hands-on investigative biology by (1) providing teachers                        process-oriented biology.  High school biology teachers and                     their students will benefit from this project.",
