 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project institutes a three-year visiting professorship                     program in gender and the sciences--which includes the                          biological and physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and                 provides semester-long visiting professorships,  faculty-mentee                 fellowships, monthly faculty development seminars for a                         semester in nine science departments, and the development or                    revision of 36 introductory science courses affecting close to                  4,000 undergraduate students during the initial funding period                  and thousands more within the next few years.  The purpose of                   this project is to address the increasing shortage in                           scientific professionals by reaching, in their early college                    years, the \"second tier\"--defined by Sheila Tobias as that                      group of students who, though qualified to do science,                          routinely choose another major. The University of Wisconsin                     System Women's Studies Consortium focuses on two aspects of                     this problem: 1) the underrepresentation of the second tier, in                 general, and women and minorities, in particular, in scientific                 and technical fields; and 2) the factors--specifically the                      content, pedagogy, and climate--in introductory science courses                 which discourage the \"second tier\" from pursuing science                        majors.  This project design is founded on the assumption that                  incorporation of the new scholarship about gender in the                        scientific canon and curriculum will improve the quality of the                 introductory courses which will, in turn, lead to the                           recruitment of more women, minorities, and others in the second                 tier to scientific education and careers.",
