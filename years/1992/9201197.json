 "awd_abstract_narration": "The integration of services that share resources on a single               network has generated an in creasing interest in analyzing models               of multiple service, multiple resource (or multi-rate)                          communication networks.  The proposed research develops efficient               computation algorithms for analyzing large multi-rate-loss                      networks.   The principal investigator will develop decomposition               algorithms that allow the exact analysis of a large class of                    models.  By reducing the analysis to that of a set of subnetworks,              the overall dimensionality of the problem and the computational                 costs are reduced significantly.  This enables the exact efficient              computation of performance measures  (e.g. blocking probabilities)              in larger models than hitherto possible.  The PI also will develop              an approximation method to analyze such models for any size and                 load.  The success of this effort would result in the development               of efficient methods for exact and approximate analysis of                      multi-rate networks of practical size and complexity.",
