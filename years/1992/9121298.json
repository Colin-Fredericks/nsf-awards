 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned about how ordinary people                    induce the causes of events.  There are two aspects to this                     question:                                                                                                                                                       The first is what is computed in the covariational component of                 causal induction.  Covariation, the difference between the                      probability of an effect given the presence of a potential causal               feature and that probability given the absence of that feature,                 has generally been regarded as a necessary although insufficient                criterion of normative causal induction.  Contrary to prior                     research, recent work by Cheng and Novick has shown that a single               reliable mechanism probably underlies this essential component.                 Uncertainty remains, however, regarding what exactly this                       component computes.  In particular, Rescorla and Wagner's                       associationist model, the dominant model in animal conditioning,                can account for many of the findings in human causal induction.                 Project I involves three predictions that differentiate between                 Rescorla and Wagner's model and Cheng and Novick's model, to be                 tested in three experiments.  This project may yield a unified                  account of the covariation component in humans and animals.                                                                                                     Project II aims at resolving a puzzling finding about the type of               information gathered to test a hypothesis and the type of                       information used in evaluating a causal hypothesis.  Recent                     evidence indicates that in evaluating a causal hypothesis, people               spontaneously make use of the frequency of the effect in the                    absence of a potential cause.  Research on the gathering of                     information for hypothesis testing, however, indicates that                     people do not search for this type of information.  Project II                  will consist of three experiments that address two issues.                      First, are people in fact able to obtain indirectly and to use                  such information despite failing to directly gather it?  The                    revision of hypotheses is one way of obtaining such information                 indirectly.  Second, is there a dissociation between what people                think they do in testing causal hypotheses and what they in fact                do?  Project II may provide an explanation of this puzzling                     finding and lead to the discovery of two distinct types of causal               reasoning.",
