 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dichrostachys group includes five genera of legumes with                    centers of diversity in Madagascar and subtropical North America.               The New World genera have been well-studied, but species and                    generic limits are poorly understood in the rarely collected                    Malagasy genera.  The proposed research will investigate                        evolutionary relationships among species in the five genera,                    integrating data from morphology, pollen, chloroplast DNA, and                  floral development.  A phylogenetic tree will serve to clarify the              generic limits, as well as provide a framework for study of the                 evolution of pollen and floral development in legumes.  This study              should also provide new insights into the biogeographic                         relationships of tropical North American legumes.  Some neotropical             species in this group are being developed as forage legumes, and                one temperate species as perennial food crop.  It is possible that              the as yet unstudied Malagasy species could likewise provide food               and forage legumes.  In addition, the proposed field work in                    Madagascar will contribute primary data on the infrequently                     collected legume flora of Madagascar.  This study represents a                  significant development in the use of molecular character systems               in the Mimosa subfamily of legumes, and is the first time that                  characters involving floral development have been intergrated with              morphological and molecular characters in a systematic analysis.",
