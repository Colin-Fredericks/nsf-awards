 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information Technology (IT) is considered as a strategic weapon               that can be used to secure competitive advantage.  Most of the                  relevant studies in this domain seek to make the case through the               development of conceptual frame works, and ex post examples of                  successful deployment of strategic IT.  Empirical evidence,                     however, suggest that many strategic IT investments became                      unfortunate strategic necessities rather than means of gaining                  competitive advantage.  Thus, many questions regarding the                      economics of strategic IT remain unanswered.  The research analyzes             IT investments under various competitive situations through the                 development of formal economic models.  The research consists of                three studies in distinct but related areas within strategic IT.                The first study involves IT related quality competition in a                    setting where two firms have the opportunity to improve the quality             of their services through IT investment.  The research analyzes the             division of technology related benefits between the firms and the               consumers, and the impacts of technological improvements on                     investment levels.  The second study focuses on competition through             IT innovation.  It analyzes the IT investment incentives of a                   market leader and a challenger, and characterizes situations in                 which there may be a reversal of such incentives.  Adoption of                  interorganizational systems is the topic of the third study.  In                particular, the optimal adoption times of an Electronic Data                    Interchange network by supplier firms are studied.  The research                is based on the Industrial Organization (IO)  approach with both                theoretical and empirical components.  Game theory is used as a                 primary theoretical research tool.  The studies enhance the                     understanding of many economic aspects of IT investments in                     competitive environments.",
