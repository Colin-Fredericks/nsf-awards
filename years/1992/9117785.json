 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many bacteria are propelled by reversible rotary motors which                   derive the energy for rotation from a protonmotive gradient.  Among             the many proteins required to build a fully functional motor, there             are five, called MotA, MotB, FliG, FliM, and FliN, that are most                likely to be involved in torque generation.  FliG, FliM, and FliN               are also important for assembly and for determining the direction               of rotation; these are called \"switch-complex\" proteins.  The roles             of the switch-complex proteins in torque generation will be                     examined, using molecular genetics to make mutations in these                   components, and detailed measurements of motor performance to                   assess the consequences.  The effects of controlled, low-level                  expression of theses proteins also will be examined.  This strategy             is similar to that used previously to study MotA and MotB.  The                 long-term objective of these studies is to understand, at the                   molecular level, how the flagellar motor converts chemical energy               into mechanical energy.  Understanding mechanisms of energy                     conversion is a central concern in bioenergetics.  Also since                   motility plays a role in certain bacterial infections,                          understanding the flagellar motor is likely to have clinical                    significance.",
