 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from NSF                 for connection of Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology,                 Simmons College, Bentley College, Babson College, Wheaton                       College, and Roger Williams College to the New England Academic                 Research Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network                   that serves the New England area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is                 to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources                   between institution, including those outside the state.                                                                                                         NEARnet will provide operations management and information                      services and it will give the six universities a connection to                  the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                     National Backbone network.                                                                                                                                      The each of the universities has written a description of its                   organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access                 that it expects including: greater functionality and network                    speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make                  file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable               mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the                links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to                    explore innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will                 expose NEARnet to a broader range of user requirements.  Nearnet                will use the information obtained by serving this diverse group                 for the benefit of New England's academic and research                          community.***//",
