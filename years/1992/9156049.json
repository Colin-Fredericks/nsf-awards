 "awd_abstract_narration": "An introductory undergraduate course in biomechanics and                        computer graphics is being developed, geared toward enhancing                   general computer literacy with regards to human motion                          modeling.  A course goal is to encourage students to assume                     responsibility for their intellectual development through                       active learning and independent investigation.  With both a                     lecture and laboratory component, the course emphasizes the                     analytical development of kinematic models, the acquisition of                  kinematic data with laboratory experiments and the use of                       computer graphics techniques for human motion rendering.  An                    educational software tool, Biomechanica, is being developed as                  a multipurpose dynamic simulation program with a user-friendly                  programming interface.   The personal computer is an                            inexpensive medium for educating our future engineers,                          scientists, and medical practitioners about the physiological                   capabilities of the human body.  The use of computer graphics                   in biomechanics usually occurs at the graduate level.  This                     course and software development effort make these topics                        accessible to lower division students.",
