 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed project is to further our understanding of              manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the                 lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The                 underlying objectives of the proposed project are to further                    characterize the structure, mechanism and function of these enzymes             and to clarify their role in lignin degradation.                                The binding, stoichiometry and mechanism of manganese oxidation by              MnP will be studied by kinetic methods and by optical and NMR                   spectroscopy.  Kinetic, spectroscopic and reactivity experiments                also will be used to examine the mechanism of oxidation of syringyl             and guaiacyl free phenolic dimeric model compounds by MnP and LiP               from P. chrysosporium, and MnP and laccase form Dichomitus                      squalens. The mechanism of nonphenolic model compound degradation               by D. squalens will also be examined.  In addition, the mechanism               of phenol oxidation by LiP and the mechanism of phenol inhibition               of nonphenolic aromatic compound oxidation by LiP will be examined.             Finally, using our P.  chrysosporium DNA transformation system, a               homologous expression system will be developed for these                        peroxidases.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer in the biosphere             and the most abundant renewable aromatic material.  This research               focusses on lignin degrading fungi and the structure and mechanisms             of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the degradation. The                  potential utilization of these micro organisms for transforming                 lignin into useful materials, chemicals and fuels is a very                     significant area of research.",
