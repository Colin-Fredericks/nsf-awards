 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trypanosomes are protozoa which cause several types of disease.                 This proposal is for the study of a unique type of mitochondrial                DNA found in trypanosomes (kinetoplast DNA) and its interaction                 with a new type II topoisomerase. Topoisomerases alter the topology             of DNA by causing transient breaks in the phosphodiester chain and              then resealing the chain. The structure of kinetoplast DNA is very              unusual. The mechanism of action of this topoisomerase will be                  compared to those of previously described topoisomerases. It is                 known that certain drugs used to treat trypanosomal infections                  interact with this topoisomerase but not others, causing cleavage               of DNA to occur but resealing not to. Synthetic DNA substrates will             be prepared which mimic bent regions in the kinetoplast DNA, cross-             over junctions, minicircles, and enzyme binding site sequences.                 These results will be compared to those obtained with natural DNA               substrates. The information obtained will add to our knowledge of               how DNA is packaged and processed in cells.                                     %%%                                                                             Trypanosomes are parasitic protozoa which cause sleeping sickness               and Chagas' disease. Several drugs are available to treat these                 diseases. They apparently function by inhibiting an enzyme called               topoisomerase II, which is found in trypanosomal mitochondria. This             enzyme is involved in DNA replication, and after drug treatment the             DNA is cleaved but not resealed. A variety of approaches using                  synthetic DNAs with structural features similar to naturally                    occurring DNA will be used to determine the mechanism of action of              the enzyme and compare it to other topoisomerases.",
