 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research of Professor H. Iwaniec and               W. Duke to work on several problems connected with analytic                     number theory and automorphic forms.  In particular, they will                  attempt to establish analytic continuation of L-functions derived               from the product of two L-functions which have functional                       equations.  They will also attempt to establish the                             equidistribution of roots of quadratic congruences to prime                     module and finally they will study generalization of the Linnik                 problem about lattice points in family of varieties.                                 This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
