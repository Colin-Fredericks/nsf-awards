 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides                one mechanism for the support of multidiscipinary teams of                      scientists and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance              Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.             The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:                     focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a                     critical area of science and engineering) but also significant                  interactions between scientific and computational activities,                   usually involving mathematical, computer or computational                       scientists, that would have impact in high-performance                          computational activity beyond the specific scientific or                        engineering problem area(s) or discipline being studied.  In the                award to Scott, McCammon, Glowinski, and Pettitt, the research will             resolve several issues that will enable high-performance computing              to solve critical problems in biomolecular design.  The most                    obvious problem relates to the difficulty in using advanced                     computer architectures.  Secondly, new algorithms (mathematical and             computer science-based) and methods (physical science-based) are                needed to solve problems with reasonable efficiency.  Finally,                  detailed understanding of what types of problems can be treated                 with vastly improved computing resources is needed to guide and                 provoke the development of both algorithms and software.  The grand             challenge problem motivating the computational research include                 thermodynamic cycle perturbation theory applied to ligand-binding               proteins and Poisson-Botzman/Brownian dynamics applied to protein               design.  The award will support postdoctoral associates, graduate               students, and the purchase of a high performance computing system.",
