 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes studies designed to characterize a novel                 12 desaturase in insects.  Vertebrates cannot synthesize and thus              require a dietary source of linoleic acid, 18:2(n-6), which is used             both as a structural component of membranes and as a precursor for              the eicosanoids.  Until recently, all animals, including insects,               were considered unable to synthesize linoleic acid.  Studies in our             laboratory demonstrated that a number of insect species possess a                12 desaturase and are thus able to produce linoleic acid.                      Extensive research, funded by the NSF, was performed to                         unambiguously demonstrate that insect tissue, and not associated                microorganisms, contain the  12 desaturase.  Studies are proposed               herein to characterize the  12 desaturase from three representative             insect species, a cockroach, a cricket and an aphid.  Work will be              done to elucidate the substrate requirements and specificity for                the desaturase, to optimize activity, to determine the number and               nature of the components in the desaturase, to examine the                      physiological regulation of activity, to determine the fate of the              newly synthesized linoleate and to begin work on the solubilization             and purification of the enzyme.  Significant fundamental knowledge              of comparative lipid metabolism will be obtained from this work.                %%%                                                                             One of the important dietary requirements in all vertebrates,                   including humans, is the essentials fatty acid, linoleic acid.                  This fatty acid is required as a component of cell membranes as                 well as functioning as a precursor for other physiologically                    important compounds such as certain hormones.  Until recently, all              animals were considered unable to synthesize this fatty acid due to             the absence of a specific enzyme, the  12 desaturase.  However, we              have discovered that many, but not all, species of insects possess              this enzyme.  Therefore, manipulation of this enzyme, novel in                  insects, holds the potential for insect control.  The work                      described in this proposal is designed to examine this enzyme in                greater detail, to compare it across insect species and to the                  similiar enzyme found in plants.  Significant fundamental knowledge             of comparative lipid metabolism will be obtained from this work.",
