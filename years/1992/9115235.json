 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David White is Director of the Hancock Biological                      Station, which is operated by Murray State University.  This                    station is located along Kentucky Lake, the largest reservoir in                the southeast U.S., created near the confluences of the                         Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers.  The Station               has been recognized by the State of Kentucky as a Research Center               of Excellence, and Murray State has joined with eight other                     colleges and universities to create a focal point for reservoir                 research.  Dr. White proposes construction of two dormitories and               two cabins for visiting scientists at the Hancock Biological                    Station.  Construction of these four winterized residences would                increase the capacity of the Station by more than 20, adding                    significantly to the presence of visiting researchers and                       students.                                                                            Research on the ecology of reservoirs has obvious and                      important implications for society.  Hancock Biological Station                 is currently a successful regional facility for student training                and for some recently initiated research projects on reservoirs.                Institutional commitments to the Station has increased its                      potential significantly, and it could develop into a nationally                 significant research facility.  The proposed visitor housing will               provide a critical mass of visiting investigators with access to                the Station, and the site's full potential should be expressed as               a result.",
