 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program offers a three year sequence of four-week summer                   institutes in Biology, together with dissemination and outreach                 activities, as part of the Woodrow Wilson National Science and                  Mathematics Leadership Program. The four-week institutes, which                 begin in the summer of 1992, are held on the campus of Princeton                University. The 1992 institute is devoted to the topic area of                  bioethics, the 1993 institute to a comprehensive view of                        traditional and contemporary biotechnology, and the 1994                        institute to middle school biology.                                                                                                                             The four-week institutes include lectures, laboratory activities,               modeling of teaching methods designed to involve students in                    their learning, extensive use of computer technology, and both                  small group and individual projects. In the follow-up and                       outreach activities, materials written by the participants are                  field-tested in their own classrooms and reproduced for                         distribution to peers. Further dissemination occurs through one-                week workshops conducted in subsequent years by teams of lead                   teachers selected from institute participants. Continuing                       contacts among the participants and the growing number of other                 classroom teachers included through the outreach projects are                   encouraged through a telecommunication network.",
