 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes an evolutionary analysis of the morphology             of the pectoral fin and related skeletal and muscular elements                  (henceforth referred to as the pectoral complex) in catfishes.  The             pectoral complex exhibits remarkable diversity in catfishes, with               regard to both structure and function.,  However, there is lacking              a comprehensive survey of this character-rich complex in the group.             This scarcity of information is particularly acute for the                      musculature of the pectoral complex.  The goals of this study are:              (1) to survey the pectoral complex in catfishes to define the                   extent of its structural diversity; (2) to determine the extent to              which evolutionary modifications of elements within the complex are             correlated to each other and to modifications in pectoral fin                   function; (3) to determine the significance of pectoral complex                 characters for inferring evolutionary relationships of the 35                   extant and fossil catfish families.                                                                                                                                  The results of this study will be used to develop hypotheses               of the structural evolution of the catfish pectoral complex that                can guide quantitative/experimental investigations.  This study                 will generate hypotheses of catfish relationships that can be                   combined with or tested by information from other                               anatomical/functional complexes.  This study will also contribute               to a better understanding of how the diversification of catfishes               has been related to earth history.  Inasmuch as catfishes                       constitute approximately 30% of all primary freshwater fishes, this             work will assist in unravelling the complex evolutionary history                of the world's freshwater fish faunas - a significant component of              aquatic biological diversity.",
