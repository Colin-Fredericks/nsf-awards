This project, in coordination with                   an effort at Ohio State University, is combining and augmenting                 these resources to develop a unified curriculum and supporting                  materials for teaching statistical concepts and methods.                        Products of the project will include: laboratory manuals                        designed as a bridge between standard texts and computer                        software that will guide students through experiments that                      generate data for analysis; start-up materials to aid students                  use computers for statistics; a machine-readable encyclopedia                   of examples and problems that will include data, descriptions                   of experiments, and computer-based retrieval; and a computer                    CD-ROM archive of edited video materials keyed to specific                      statistical concepts and tied to an instructional statistics                    program.",
