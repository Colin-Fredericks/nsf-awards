 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employment relationships across all sizes of firms were altered                 since the 19th century, as wage-earners in America moved from                   small enterprises to large ones.  Simply put, there was                         transition from a spot market for labor to one of implicit and                  explicit contractual relations.  The purpose of this project is                 analyze the dimensions of the changing relationship between firms               and workers and the implications of this changing relationship                  for the economy.  This research is particularly timely and                      important given the continuing and major restructuring of the                   American economy and the consequences this holds for American                   workers.                                                                                                                                                        The underlying thesis to be tested is that a chaotic labor                      market, in which workers often participated in nonproductive                    mobility, was replaced by one that grated labor property rights                 in jobs and that more fully utilized the work force.  Labor                     unions, unemployment insurance, and other protection for labor                  fostered the change, but it was also brought about by other                     forces.  Various aspects of this evolution will be analyzed more                thoroughly such as unemployment and the wage structure across the               20th century.  In addition, several related issues will also be                 studied including the returns to general and to specific human                  capital, the length of the employment relationship, the provision               of benefits, the inter-industry wage differential, and the impact               of immigration.  Some of the necessary data sets exist, but in                  addition a large sample of firm-level records will be assembled                 to reveal details about worker-firm relationships during the 20th               century.",
