S. universities by examining               Social Security Administration data on those working in the                     United States.  This research will strengthen current information               of stay rates of foreign students obtained from the \"states                     intentions\" given in the annual NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates.                Intentions can change.  The research approach utilizes the social               security numbers of foreign nationals who obtained doctorates                   in 1983, 1985, and 1986, to determine who is earning wages in                   later years (1985-90).  A similar study was conducted in 1985 on                one year of doctoral data, in 1982, measuring stay rates one and                two years after completion of the doctorate.  The results of the                first study were very accurate.  The current study would update                 information on the stay rate of recent doctoral recipients and                  expand information on the length of stay of up to seven years.                                                                                                       This information of employed foreign S&E doctorates is an                  important component of the S&E labor force statistics and of                    vital interest to Congress and science policy decision-makers.",
