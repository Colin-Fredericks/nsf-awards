The primary objective of this Workshop             is to bring together international talents to address areas of                  research relevant to technology for infrastructure development and              maintenance.  There will be a particular emphasis on Port and                   Airport Development Strategy in Hong Kong, which is one of the                  largest civil engineering projects ever attempted.                                                                                                              The workshop will include four subject areas:  Building Engineering             (focussing on active structural control techniques to mitigate                  building response under dynamic environment (;Bridge Engineering                (damage assessment and dynamic response of suspension and                       cablestayed bridges); Costal Engineering (effect of storm surges                and typhoons on harbors and bays and new protection alternatives)               and Geotechnical Engineering (progress in marine applications,                  harbor landfill projects and stability of slopes).",
