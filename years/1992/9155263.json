 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation will                          conduct a two-and-one-half-year project to expand the                           existing Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program for middle and                       high school mathematics teachers to include two new strands:                    Quantity (for middle school teachers in 1992) and Change                        (for high school teachers in 1993).  Each strand would                          consist of a four-week summer institute for 50 expert,                          experienced mathematics teachers (held on the Princeton                         University campus), outreach projects initiated by teachers                     from the institutes, and one-week regional summer institutes                    each led by a team of four teachers from the four-week                          institutes.  Participants from the four-week institutes will                    adapt materials, resources and technology presented at the                      institutes into units for classroom use which will be field-                    tested, edited, and disseminated through the one-week                           institutes.                                                                                                                                                     The goal of the Quantity institute is to help teachers                          develop solid, informal understanding of statistics from                        experiences involving the collection, organization,                             representation and interpretation of data, and to develop                       concepts and methods for investigating situations involving                     change, to make predictions when uncertainty exists, and to                     make sense out of statistical claims.  The goal of the                          Change institute is to help teachers become sensitive to the                    patterns of change and to learn to use the tools that will                      be necessary to study these patterns.                                                                                                                           Second-wave participants of the outreach programs and one-                      week institutes should number approximately 3000, bringing                      the total number of teachers enhanced to approximately 3100.                                                                                                    The Woodrow Wilson Program has a distinguished history of                       high quality institutes with participants exerting a long                       term influence on their peers through continuing teacher                        enhancement efforts financed by the private sector.  The Pew                    Charitable Trusts' cost-sharing on this project accounts for                    60% of the NSF budget.",
