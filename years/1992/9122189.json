 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental resources such as wilderness areas, plant or animal               species, and visibility are public goods yielding benefits which                may be broadly classified as use and non-use.  For example, in                  the case of a remote wilderness area some people intend to visit                it, and they will enjoy a use benefit.  Others are not certain                  they will ever visit the area, but nonetheless wish to keep that                option open.  Still others derive a benefit from simply knowing                 the wilderness area exists.  These option and existence values                  represent categories of non-use values.  The Grand Canyon is a                  good example of a resource which gives rise to all three                        categories of values.  The sum of the use, option, and existence                values represents the total value of the environmental amenity.                 It is important to identify the individual components, not only                 the total value of these amenities.  Such identification is                     important to ensuring consistency of measurement as well as to                  address questions of the appropriate means to fund the provision,               protection and preservation of these amenities.                                                                                                                 It is fairly well understood how to properly measure the benefit                to direct users (use value).  However, there is much less                       agreement concerning the measurement of non-use (option and                     existence) values.  The purpose of this project is to conduct a                 series of laboratory experiments designed to measure these three                benefit components associated with environmental amenities.  The                study will provide estimates of the bounds on the values arising                from existence and option component of total value.  This                       research is important because increasing stress on the natural                  environment is causing public policy to focus on issues                         associated with the preservation environmental assets.  Further,                the courts have seen fit to include non-use values in                           environmental damage cases.  Thus, there is a need to develop                   methods for accurate measurement of non-use values.",
