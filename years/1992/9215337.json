 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue work on dynamic, lattice, d-Schur-              convex-cost and concave-cost programming with applications to                   inventory control, scheduling, networks, and multiperson decisions.             The theory of lattice programming and of substitutes, complements               and ripples in network flows will continue to be developed to                   enable one to predict the direction of changes of optimal and                   equilibrium decisions resulting from changes in parameters without              computation.  This work will be continued and extended in a variety             of significant directions including stochastic network flows,                   Leontief substitution systems and the development of efficient                  algorithms.  Decision problems in which there are economies-of-                 scale lead to minimum-concave-cost mathematical programs.  These                problems will continue to be studied with the aim of identifying                broad classes of problems that can be solved in polynomial time.                Important problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty              can be studied as Markov branching decision process.  A variety of              problems will be studied in this area including controlled                      populations, geometric population growth, complexity of computation             and generalized semi-Markov decision processes.                                      Special attention will be focused on developing approximation              methods with guaranteed high-effectiveness and fast running times               for large-scale systems.  This work will be applied to yield                    management, single- and multi-product/echelon/facility inventory                models under uncertainty, and other areas.",
