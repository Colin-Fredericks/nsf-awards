 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important function of estradiol (E2) is to stimulate                         cell proliferation and to induce synthesis of specific proteins                 in target cells.  Both of these effects are believed to involve                 changes in the RNA transcriptional program of target cells.                     Experiments are designed to detect transcriptional changes in                   cultured human endometrial cells (Ishikawa cell line) in response               to physiological concentrations of E2.  There are a number of                   human endometrial cell lines around but few of them actually                    retain E2 responsiveness.  The Ishikawa cell line has been shown                to retain its ability to respond: proliferation can be                          stimulated and specific proteins can be induced.  Changes in                    specific mRNA are essential to these effects.  These changes will               be studied in a systematic way during the first 24 hours                        following the addition of E2.  If E2 effects on these cells are                 comparable to those occurring in vivo it might be expected that                 some genes will be induced soon after exposure, as a direct                     result of E2 receptor interaction with DNA (primary response).                  Other gene inductions may not be detected until many hours after                E2, their induction requiring a protein induced as part of the                  primary response.  Such responses are sometimes characterized as                secondary responses.  Experiments are suggested that may lead to                detecting whether both kinds of mRNA's are increased in response                to E2 in human endometrial cells and begin to study and compare                 the characteristics of these responses.",
