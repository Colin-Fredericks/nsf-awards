 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Norman Howard School Demonstration Project seeks funds                      for a three-year program to enhance 90 middle school                            mathematics teachers to respond to the needs of learning                        disabled (LD) students who are mainstreamed in regular                          mathematics classes.  The project will a) develop                               alternative instructional strategies that support learning                      disabled students' mathematics learning and embed these                         strategies in field tested exemplary geometry and algebra                       units; (b) implement three model teacher enhancement                            programs for middle school mathematics teachers from the                        Greater Rochester area; and (c) develop a \"package\"                             containing materials and suggestions to organize similar                        programs nationwide.  In addition to the Norman Howard                          staff, nine core teachers from four middle school sites will                    be members of the staff team and will be responsible for                        developing and field-testing materials to be used in the                        enhancement phase of the project.  The mathematical focus of                    the project will be introductory algebra and geometry while                     the instructional focus will be on construction of                              knowledge, use of manipulative and cooperative learning.                        Each teacher participant will be part of one of three                           enhancement models:  an intensive summer institute followed                     by year-long experiences involving classroom                                    experimentation; a series of ten workshops throughout the                       Fall semester of the school year; and a series of ten                           revised workshops through the Spring semester of the school                     year.                                                                                                                                                           Norman Howard School, University of Rochester and                               participating school district cost-sharing accounts for 32%                     of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                                              This project fills an important need, that of developing                        materials for and enhancing middle school mathematics                           teachers in instructional strategies in mathematics for LD                      students integrated into mainstream mathematics classes.",
