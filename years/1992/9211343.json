 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation and application of techniques for                        obtaining macroscopic approximations for communication networks                 is studied. These approximations are deterministic,  described by               ordinary differential equations, and stochastic (diffusion),                    described by  stochastic differential equations.  The former                    yield approximations for the time dependent behavior, while the                 latter quantify the statistical deviations. The techniques                      consist of a combination of weak convergence and martingale                     methods. The proposed methods allow for the investigation of                    networks with service times having not only  exponential but also               general service time distributions. The transmission rates can                  be taken to depend on the buffer occupancies, which is important                in congestion control applications. The importance of those                     approximations becomes clear given the  non-existence of flexible               analytical tools that can give estimates of queue lengths and                   other performance measures for such (non-product-form) networks.                The approximate models, arising via certain limiting procedures,                will be used to further study stability  issues, settling times                 and rates of convergence to the steady state. The methods and                   estimates will be established mathematically and also validated                 numerically and by  simulations.",
