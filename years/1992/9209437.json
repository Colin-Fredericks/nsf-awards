 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is the                anatomical substrate for a circadian biological clock that controls             many overt rhythms in physiology and behavior.  The mechanism(s)                responsible for the generation of circadian rhythmicity by the                  suprachiasmatic nucleus is (are) unknown.  It is known, however,                that the ability to generate action potentials is not necessary for             the workings of the circadian clock.  Therefore, other forms of                 intercellular communications must mediate circadian-rhythm                      generation.  Dr. Nunez will examine the possibility that the                    interaction between neurons and glial cells of the suprachiasmatic              nucleus is critical.  Using electronmicroscopy, he will determine               whether plasticity in glial cell morphology over the circadian                  cycle impacts on inter-neuronal communications and, thus, impose                circadian rhythmicity on the neural outputs of the suprachiasmatic              nucleus.  The concept of biological timing rivals that of                       homeostasis as an organizing principle in contemporary biology.                 Understanding the basic neural mechanisms may lead to treatments                that could help solve problems caused by jet lag, shift work and                sleep disorders in the elderly. Indeed, in so far as circadian                  rhythm studies will ultimately have an impact on virtually all                  areas of human endeavor distributed across the seasons and phases               of the day, this work may have a direct effect on the nation's                  scientific and engineering research, education and human resources              bases.",
