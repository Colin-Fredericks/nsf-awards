It is a three year project                utilize existing data sets and models in the evaluation heat and                salt transfer at the ice-water interface and to gain fundamental                insights into the roles of leads and thin ice in these processes.               A model for the distribution of shortwave energy in ice and lead                systems, combined with models of turbulent transfer in the upper                ocean, will be utilized in the analyses of existing data and to                 quantify spatial and temporal variations in the flux of heat energy             from the Arctic Ocean to the sea ice within the Arctic Basin.                   Other simulations will explore the relationship between summer ice              conditions and mixed layer temperature, long-term implications of               seasonal variations in the flux of heat from the ocean to sea ice,              and possible situations that could lead to a disappearance of the               arctic ice pack.",
