 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clastic sediments delivered to the margins of many sedimentary             basins commonly form deltaic successions which forestep and                     backstep on evenly deepening ramps, rather than the more commonly               modeled shelf-slope-basin floor bathymetry.  The properties of                  sequence boundaries, and the geometry and stacking of sequence                  elements (\"systems tracts\") in such ramp settings are highly                    controversial and very few published examples are well constrained.             This project is an integrated study of sequence geometry in ramp                settings.  The project will consist of conceptual and numerical                 modeling accompanied by rigorous field testing in one of the best               exposed successions of clastic ramp sequences in the world:  the                Upper Cretaceous marginal marine deposits of the San Juan basin,                New Mexico.  The primary objectives of this project are to (1)                  identify, evaluate and map stratigraphic surfaces, which meet such              objective criteria for a sequence boundary as downward shift in                 onlap and subaerial exposure of older marine strata, (2) test the               concepts of instantaneous versus diachronous formation of sequence              boundaries, (3) document stacking patterns and volumetric                       partitioning of sediment between different elements (systems                    tracts) of the sequences, (4) forward model variations in sequence              geometry in response to different rates of tectonic subsidence,                 rates and amplitudes of sea level change, and sediment supply.                  Two-dimensional, flexural backstripping will be applied to                      reconstruct the geometry of the depositional surfaces through time.             The modeling will be based on a combination of two numerical                    methods.  One is a kinematic model using preset depositional slopes             and sediment supply to generate the stratigraphic response to sea               level and tectonic fluctuations.  The second is a diffusion model               that simulates sediment transport in a \"foreland\" basin setting.                The overall goal of the project is to provide improved precision in             models predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of                      lithologic units in basins with ramp margins, and to enable the                 extraction of more precise information about past sea level                     fluctuations from the stratigraphic record.",
