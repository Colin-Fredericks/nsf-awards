This survey,                a sample survey of higher education institutions, will be                       conducted in two phases.  Phase I will collect and process only                 the department/facility survey questionnaire, which will survey                 academic departments or nondepartmental research units that                     contain at least one research instrument system costing $20,000                 or more.  During Phase II the contractor will collect and process               the full-scale survey, which consists of both the department/                   facility questionnaire, and an equipment questionnaire which will               be used to collect data for samples of research instrument                      systems within sampled departments/facilities.  The sample shall                be limited to instruments with an original purchase price of                    $20,000 or more.  Contractor tasks for Cycle IV will include                    conduct of data collection activities, tabulation of data                       results, provision of technical support as required for the                     National Science Foundation's own analytical uses of the data,                  and production of final analytical reports summarizing the                      results of the study.                                                                                                                                                The 96th Congress (Public Law 96-44, Section 7) directed NSF               to \"...develop indices, correlates, or other suitable measures or               indicators of the status of scientific instrumentation in the                   United States and of the current and projected need for                         scientific and technological instrumentation.\"  This study,                     initiated in response to the above mandate, measures changes and                trends in the instrumentation needs and the national inventory of               scientific research equipment in academic institutions.",
