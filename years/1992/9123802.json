 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports research on long-range electron transfer by                    Dr. Alvin D. Joran of the Chemistry Department, New York                        University, and collaborators Drs. Joseph Malinsky and Yuri                     Magarshak in biophysics at Mount Sinai Medical School.  The                     goal of the research is to determine whether and to what extent                 hydrogen bonds in peptides mediate electron transfer.                           Synthetic model compounds in which electron donor and acceptor                  sites are directly linked to a known inflexible alpha-helical                   peptide backbone will be prepared.  The distance between the                    ruthenium complex donor and quinone acceptor will be                            systematically varied and the kinetics measured using                           time-resolved emission or transient absorption spectral                         techniques.  In the accompanying theoretical portion of the                     project, graph and propagator formalism will be applied to                      coupling electron transfer pathways including any number of                     resides and side groups.  The predictions will be tested                        against the experimental results and other available data on                    surface-labelled redox proteins.                                                %%%                                                                             Transfer of electrons over relatively long distances is an                      important process in biological systems as well as in molecular                 wires or non-linear optical devices.  The contribution of                       hydrogen bonds to electron transfer is not well understood.                     Joran et al. have devised a rigid system in which to study the                  process and will use some novel calculational approaches to                     understand the effect.",
