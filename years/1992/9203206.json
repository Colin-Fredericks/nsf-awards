 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of ecological specialization is a major theme                in evolutionary history.  The evolutionary consequences of such                 specialization have received considerable attention, but have                   rarely been studied using knowledge of phylogenetic relationships               of the taxa involved, a prerequisite for answering many kinds of                evolutionary questions.  This research will involve an                          investigation of the evolutionary consequences of trophic                       specialization in garter snakes (genus Thamnophis) using an                     explicitly phylogenetic approach.  The first part of the study                  tests hypotheses that certain traits (head shapes and visual                    characteristics) are adaptations for a specialized underwater                   foraging mode.  The investigation will provide an especially                    powerful examination of adaptive hypotheses by combining within a               phylogenetic context (1) comparative tests of the evolutionary                  association of head shape and visual traits with feeding mode,                  and (2) experimental analyses of trait function.  The second part               of the study will involve rigorous phylogenetic and statistical                 tests of the idea that specialist taxa are constrained in their                 subsequent evolution.  These tests will focus on trophic niche                  transitions among terrestrial specialists, aquatic specialists,                 and generalist garter snakes.  This examination of constraint                   will complement the tests of adaptation, because contraints on                  niche transitions provide the evolutionary boundaries within                    which the adaptive changes occur.",
