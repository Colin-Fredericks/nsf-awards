 "awd_abstract_narration": "3-D Electromagnetic Particle Simulation on the                               Solar Wind Energy Transfer into the Magnetosphere                               Recently developed particle code techniques and                                 faster computers have made possible have made                                   possible 3-D and fully have made possible 3-D and                               fully electromagnetic simulations.  These new                                   techniques will be applied to the global                                        interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's                                  magnetosphere to investigate energy transport                                   through the bowshock and magnetopause and on into                               the magnetosphere.  Evolution and configuration of                              the magnetopause is handled through dynamic                                     particle-field pressure balance.  Applicable plasma                             instabilities will be studied using the code,                                   thus complementing analytical theories of the                                   magnetopause.  Resulting nonlinear phenomena,                                   namely heating and diffusion of particle due to                                 excited waves, will be compared with relevant                                   observations.  The new 3-D electromagnetic (E-M)                                code is already operational and preliminary results                             show how the magnetopause is created.  Energetic                                solar particles enter the forward magnetic cusps                                and descend into the auroral zones.  The bunching                               of plasma due to kinetic instabilities is seen at                               the magnetopause near the equatorial plane.                                     Heating of both ions and electrons is observed and                              dawn-dusk asymmetry is also seen.  The same code is                             capable of simulating the effects of changes in                                 various solar wind conditions such as: wind density                             and velocity, electron and ion temperatures, cross-                             field flow component of the flow, and                                           interplanetary (IMF) strength and orientation.  A                               variety of diagnostics is ready to apply to code                                results, including novel 3-D graphics techniques,                               monitoring of excited waves by tranform methods and                             the measuring of diffusion rates.",
