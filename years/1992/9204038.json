 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is related to several areas of                       probability theory: the theory of symmetric diffusion processes                 and Dirichlet forms, stochastic differential geometry, and the                  analysis of heat kernels.  The principal investigator plans to                  extend the results of Carmona and Zheng about the small time                    asymptotics of the probability that Brownian paths visiting the                 sets of a given finite sequence.  These extensions will be used                 to solve several questions: the monotonicity of heat kernels                    associated to Newmann boundary conditions (Chavel's conjecture)                 for all times, the study of Riemannian manifolds with piecewise                 constant metrics via the precise path behavior of Brownian                      motions on these manifolds, and the study of general non-smooth                 Riemannian manifolds and in particular the Harnack's inequality                 by using the above concrete results and weak convergence.                            There have been a lot of studies about the propagation of                  heat on some geometric body with smooth surfaces made by some                   unitary material.  The situation becomes more complicated when                  the surface is not smooth or the body is made with materials of                 different thermal conductivities.  This research is aimed at a                  microscopic analysis of the latter case using probability theory.",
