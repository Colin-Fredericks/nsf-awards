 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plagioclase feldspars are abundant primary minerals in nature              and represent an important source of Ca and Na in noncarbonate                  systems.  Two phase intergrowths of calcic and sodic rich phases                (exsolution lamellae) are common features in plagioclase feldspars,             yet few studies have evaluated their role in the rates,                         stoichiometry and mechanisms of plagioclase dissolution.  The                   objectives of the proposed collaborative study are to (i) determine             the effects of exsolution lamellae on the rates and stoichiometry               of plagioclase feldspars, (ii) determine the effect of                          preferentially weathered lamellar phases on the interpretation of               data collected using surfaced sensitive spectroscopies such as                  x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and (iii) examine the                    potential role of exsolved phases in preferential release of Ca                 from plagioclase samples collected from well characterized                      watershed laboratories.  Collaboration among the principal                      investigators will combine expertise and facilities necessary to                accomplish these objectives.  Dissolution experiments will be                   conducted at pH 4 using batch pH stat, flow through cell, and                   column reaction vessels using plagioclase samples over a range of               an contents with and without exsolution lamellae.  In addition,                 plagioclase samples from watershed laboratories will be used in                 characterization and dissolution studies to evaluate the potential              role of exsolution lamellae in natural systems.  The surfaces of                reacted minerals will be characterized using scanning electron                  microscopy (SEM-EDX), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and                high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM-EDX,                    HRTEM-ED).  Results from this study will be used to model the rate              and stoichiometry of plagioclase dissolution as a function of An                content in minerals with and without exsolved phases.  Hypotheses               concerning the mechanisms of plagioclase dissolution and the                    preferential release of Ca relative to Si and Na during dissolution             will be tested for both laboratory and watershed weathering                     environments.",
