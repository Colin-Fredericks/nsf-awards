 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the time of Darwin on, the social insects have posed one of                the great puzzles of evolutionary biology.  Their worker castes                 are the prime example of reproductive altruism in the natural                   world, yet the process of natural selection is expected, for the                most part, to lead to reproductive selfishness.  How can evolution              lead to giving up reproduction?  The answer for social insects                  (and perhaps also to some extent for humans) turns out to be                    kinship.  Colonies of social insects are groups of kin.  Workers                don't reproduce, but they help relatives to reproduce and this                  permits selection for genes for working behavior.                                                                                                               However, we still don't understand what kind of balance is struck               between the interests of the individual and the interests of the                group as a whole.  The same evolutionary kinship theory that                    explains how cooperation can evolve also predicts that there may                be conflict within colonies.  This is particularly true if                      individuals can distinguish and aid their closest relatives in                  their colony, but it is not known whether they do this.  Drs.                   Strassmann and Queller will use DNA technology to answer this                   question.  They will use a class of genes called microsatellite                 genes.  Because these genes are both numerous and highly variable,              they can be used to make the necessary fine-level estimates of                  relatedness.                                                                                                                                                    Thus, Drs. Strassmann and Queller will determine to what extent                 social insect colonies really are completely cooperative entities,              or if they are in part cryptically contentious assemblies of                    individuals, each pursuing its own aims.  This will greatly                     increase understanding of the extent and nature of altruism in the              natural world.                                                                                                                                                  This project will contribute to the new technology surrounding                  microsatellite genes, which is important in many areas, including               all kinds of evolutionary studies, conservation genetics,                       forensics, and gene-mapping studies for agricultural and medical                needs.  Besides contributing to the training of postdoctoral and                graduate students, Drs. Strassmann and Queller encourage                        participation of undergraduates, high school students, and                      teachers who take the knowledge they gain back to the classroom.",
