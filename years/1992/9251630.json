 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arkansas College has created a computing laboratory consisting                  of a network of nine microcomputers located in the experimental                 physics laboratory, and the created a new experimental physics                  curriculum for first and second-year science majors.  The goal                  of these laboratories is to teach experimental physics and                      computer use in science concurrently by use of a thematic                       curriculum with special emphasis on the study of oscillatory                    and resonant systems using computer interfaced sensors.  Most                   important physical laws apply to oscillators, so the narrowing                  of breadth in the course is minimal, while the depth has been                   greatly increased.  The laboratory exercises used have been                     chosen in this way to focus the students attention on                           confirmation, analysis, and interpretation of results;                          therefore, we have eliminated many standard laboratory                          exercises which served only to demonstrate the correctness of                   material covered in the lecture.The motivation for this                         approach lies in the faculty's belief that teaching the                         experimental method in science is a most important task, and                    therefore the laboratory should not merely be used to support                   the teaching of theory.  Students must be able to observe and                   experience physical phenomena in a way that develops and                        enhances both their senses of observation and their reasoning                   ability.  The students use the computers to collect and analyze                 data, perform error analysis on the data, prepare graphical                     presentations of their results, compare their results with                      software simulations of the experiments and with calculations                   based on theory, and prepare their laboratory reports.",
