 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Public Radio is seeking to expand its coverage of                      scientific issues in two ways:  through the creation of a                       new Environmental Reporting Unit, and through the                               introduction of SCIENCE FRIDAY, a two hour call-in talk show                    dedicated to scientific issues.  Each of these projects will                    be supported by an extensive outreach effort targeted at                        local schools, community groups, science museums, and nature                    centers.                                                                                                                                                        Through the Environmental Reporting Unit, NPR plans to                          produce eight to ten half hour documentary reports per year                     on critical environmental issues.  Each of these reports                        will be available to listeners on cassette and will be                          accompanied by supporting documentation.                                                                                                                        The SCIENCE FRIDAY team will engage NPR's audience in a                         lively debate on questions ranging from nuclear physics to                      archaeology.  In addition, SCIENCE FRIDAY will travel to                        high schools and museums across the country and engage in                       question and answer sessions with students, teachers,                           parents and school administrators.  These \"on the road\"                         segments will be supplemented by live broadcasts from annual                    meetings of the National Association for Science (NAS) and                      the American Association for the Advancement of Science                         (AAAS).                                                                                                                                                         Through these efforts, NPR will be able to draw listener                        attention to the need for improved science and mathematics                      education, while helping listeners make informed evaluations                    of current public policy in these areas.",
