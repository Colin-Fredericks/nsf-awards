 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a           U.S.-Japan Seminar on Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of                     Membrane and Storage Lipids of Plants, to be held December 14-                  16, 1992 in Kona, Hawaii.  The co-organizers are Professor                      Christopher Somerville, Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State               University, and Professor Norio Murata, Department of Regulation                Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan.                  This seminar will provide a forum for representatives of the major              academic and industrial research laboratories in the United States              and Japan, as well as major academic research groups in four                    European countries, to exchange up to date information and explore              possible collaboration.                                                                                                                                         The significance of the topic of the seminar lies in the fact that              membrane lipid composition is thought to be a major component of                chilling tolerance in higher plants.  In addition, the composition of           dietary vegetable oils has significant health effects and the                   composition of non-food oils determines the utility of the oils for a           wide range of non-food industrial applications.  Recent advances in             plant molecular biology have raised the possibility of using genetic            engineering techniques to modify oil composition and the cold                   tolerance of plants by rational genetic modification of crop species            using cloned genes.  Since most of the research groups with                     expertise in both biochemistry and molecular biology are in the                 United States and Japan, their meeting in this seminar along with               some of their European colleagues should prove fruitful.",
