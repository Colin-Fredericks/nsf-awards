 "awd_abstract_narration": "When Escherichia coli cells exhaust a nutrient, they cease dividing             and enter a non-growing state.  When nutrients are restored, the                cells can resume growth quickly.  Even after several weeks of                   starvation, many cells in a culture retain this ability to resume               growth whn conditions become more favorable. Molecular analysis of              the events that occur upon entry into the stationary phase, during              prolonged starvation, and during the resumption of growth, have                 revealed some of the regulatory mechanisms that starved cell                    utilize in order to survive.  This work continues to expand our                 understanding of stationary phase physiology.  We will analyze the              regulation of transcription form two stationary phase-ducible                   promoters.  To study the starvation signal transduction pathway, we             will isolate conditional mutations that cause E. coli cells to                  express starvation-specific genes during exponential growth.  We                will also investigate the role of a novel starvation-specific                   histone-like protein, VTM, in maintaining the endogenous metabolic              activity of starved cells for resumption of exponential growth                  starvation.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This work addresses a fundamental question in the physiology of                 bacteria: how do bacteria respond to and survive periods of                     prolonged starvation.",
