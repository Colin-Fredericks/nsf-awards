 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retinoblastoma gene is one of the best characterized tumor                  suppressor genes.  The loss of Rb function has been correlated with             the etiology of a subset of human neoplasias such as                            retinoblastomas, osteosarcomas, small lung carcinomas, breast                   carcinomas, etc.  The Rb protein is also an important regulator of              normal cell proliferation and has been shown to bind DNA tumor                  virus oncoproteins, such as adenovirus EIA, papillomavirus E7 and               SV40 T antigen.  Thus elucidation of the normal role of Rb protein              and identification of the cellular targets of its interactions is               critically important.  Rb protein has been shown to interact with               cellular transcription factors E2F.  The interactions of Rb with                E2F are particularly significant as E2F has been shown to be                    involved in the transcription of several proliferation associated               genes.  The work described is based on the principal investigator's             recent observation that Rb protein in the from of a cellular                    complex, E2F-I, inhibits the DNA binding activity of the                        transcription factor E2F by forming an E2F/E2F-I complex.  In this              proposal: i) we plan to characterize the Rb associated proteins                 that cooperate with Rb to reconstitute the E2F-I activity.  ii)                 analyze the cell cycle dependent biochemical alterations of E2F-I,              which will enable us to correlate the growth suppressor function of             Rb with its regulation of E2F DNA binding activity.                             %%%                                                                             The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein has been shown to act as a                      suppressor of cell growth which suggests it is an important                     regulator of normal cell proliferation.  Rb has been shown to bind              DNA tumor virus oncoproteins (proteins which in mutated forms can               cause uncontrolled cell growth).  The elucidation of the normal                 role of Rb protein and identification of the cellular targets of                its interactions is a fundamental question in understanding cell                growth.  Rb protein has been shown to interact with a cellular                  protein E2F.  The interactions of Rb with E2F are particularly                  significant as E2F has been shown to regulate several cell growth               associated genes.  A recent observation is that Rb protein forms a              cellular complex, E2F-I, which inhibits E2F by forming an E2F/E2F-I             complex.  Proposed research involves:  i) characterizing the Rb                 associated proteins and reconstituting the E2F-I activity; and ii)              analyze the cell cycle regulation of the factor E2F-I, which will               enable the correlation of the growth suppressor function of Rb with             its regulation of E2F DNA binding activity.",
