 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program involves the analysis of                     magnetic field data acquired by the Swedish Viking and FREJA                    satellites and by the DoD HILAT, Polar BEAR, DMSP-F7, and TRIAD                 satellites.  We intend to use these data in correlation with                    magnetic field observations from the NASA AMPTE/CCE and MAGSAT                  satellites in studies of the earth's magnetospheric and ionospheric             current systems, both large and small scale, as well as magnetic                wave phenomena.                                                                      We propose to contrast the global current systems during                   active storm times vs. magnetically quiet times.  A remote sensing,             two-dimensional, horizontal current analysis has been performed on              the MAGSAT data and matched to equatorial CCE results.  These                   results are preliminary and we propose to complete, improve and                 apply this analysis technique to other cases involving dynamic                  circuits.  We propose to determine the full three-dimensional                   ionospheric-magnetospheric current system during northward                      interplanetary magnetic field conditions as well.  The most                     significant result and, also, remaining question is the confinement             of the northward Bz (NBZ) currents to above 80 degrees in the case              studied and the connection (or lack of connection) of the polar                 currents to the auroral zone current system for other cases.  We                intend to study the fine scale Birkeland currents involved in                   auroral acceleration processes, especially in the context of the                storm and substorm circuit.                                                          We propose to continue our analysis of shorter time scale                  disturbances involved in the transition to wave phenomena.  Some of             the wave field subjects to be studied include: global MHD resonant              and/or driven pulsations; local and remote particle-field cyclotron             interactions; multi-satellite MFE data analysis to study global                 perturbations caused by solar wind pressure variations; statistical             analysis of ULF waves from ground and spacecraft data; ULF wave                 propagation, including incoherent pulsation activity; and GOES and              CCE spacecraft conjunction studies of ULF events.                                    We intend to disseminate data and information by way of                    scientific journal publication, presentations, and collaborative                efforts with individual scientists and agency program as we have                done in the past.  We propose to incorporate the upcoming FREJA                 mission data into this analysis effort as we have done with                     previous magnetic field data sets.  The expanded FREJA data                     coverage will coordinate well with other programs, especially GEM               and the internation STEP programs, as well as provide a maore                   complete MFE data base.  The high resolution realtime data will                 advance our fine-scale as well as large-scale current studies and               the dedicated wave channels will improve our ability to evaluate                wave disturbance fields.",
