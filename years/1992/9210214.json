 "awd_abstract_narration": "To support various product engineering applications                        efficiently, product models need to be represented with higher-                 level geometric entitles, from which meaningful engineering                     information can be extracted.  The objective of this project is to              develop a representation scheme for product models based on form                features.  The intent is to provide a product model to support                  various product engineering activities through a central form                   feature decomposition that possesses intrinsic advantages                       applicable to a wide range of manufacturing process design                      activities.  The central form feature decomposition is to be                    obtained by automatic recognition of form features using a convex               decomposition called Alternating Sum of Volumed with Partitioning.              Geometric domain of product shapes that the feature decomposition               covers is extended to support practical parts by exploiting local               rounding operations.                                                                 The product model scheme to be developed must serve as the                 core of the integration of product engineering, from design to                  manufacturing.",
