 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a five year program that will develop twelve                    field tested, open-ended research projects that can be used                     by biology teachers as investigative science projects with                      first year biology students.  The research projects will be                     developed by biology teachers working with laboratory                           scientists at the North Carolina Research Triangle Park and                     in the Washington, D.C. area.  The National Association of                      Biology Teachers will coordinate the project.                                                                                                                   Twelve teams of two teachers will be paired with a scientist                    from a university or industry and work in their laboratory                      for three weeks during the summer of 1993.  During this time                    the team will work with the researcher to develop a simple,                     low cost,  open-ended research project that can be used in                      their classroom.  The teachers will gain hands-on experience                    with the procedures in the laboratory of the scientist and                      then field test the experiment with their own students                          during the following academic year and modify it as needed.                                                                                                     A special education teacher will work with the NABT staff to                    modify the projects for students with special needs, and the                    projects will then be field tested nationwide.  Input from                      the nationwide testing will then be used to modify the                          projects further.  They will then be compiled into a                            monograph which will be made available to biology teachers                      nationwide.  Project results will be disseminated through                       inservice workshops at national and state science teacher                       conventions and in local school districts.                                                                                                                      Cost sharing equals 16.8% of the NSF award.",
