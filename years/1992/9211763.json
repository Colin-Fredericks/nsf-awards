Krishnamurthy, Institute of Economic                                    Growth, University of Delhi and Lawrence Klein,                                 Department of Economics, University of                                          Pennsylvania.  India has a long and respectable                                 record in research work related to empirical                                    modeling and is currently working on the                                        construction of an econometric model that is                                    both comprehensive and flexible, capable of                                     reflecting the existing complexities of the                                     Indian economy and of anticipating developments                                 that may emerge in future years.  The model                                     will be maintained, revised and updated                                         continuously and used in forecasting and policy                                 analysis. It will consist of a core                                             macroeconometric model having components                                        reflective of the most vital growth factors in                                  the economy, as well as four mutually                                           interactive submodels for: 1) agriculture, 2)                                   industry, 3) public sector, 4) foreign trade.                                   These satellite models will be integrated into                                  the core model but capable of use in a stand                                    alone mode.  The major thrust areas will be: --                                 the strengthening of the segment dealing with                                   external economic relations, development of a                                   more efficient public sector capable of greater                                 surplus generation, and growth in agriculture                                   which is critical for satisfactory growth of                                    the whole economy.  The model will use time-                                    series data compiled by the Central Statistical                                 Organization, the Reserve Bank of India, and                                    other reliable data sources in India.                                           The proposed project will collaborate the                                       efforts of Indian econometricians with                                          researchers  at project LINK, University of                                     Pennsylvania.  Project LINK is an international                                 research  group that does statistical studies                                   of world trade and payments.  National                                          econometric models from many countries and                                      regions throughout the world are installed at                                   LINK as components of a total international                                     trading system.  The models are used for                                        studying world economic trends and                                              international economic policy.                                                                                                                                  Scope: This project will support research among                                 world class econometricians and contribute                                      to the development of a long overdue economic                                   growth model for India.  As a major economic                                    power, India ranks high as a candidate for                                      explicit modeling in the LINK context.  This                                    research will provide an international                                          perspective on economic tendencies and a means                                  for assessing their impact on India.  In                                        addition, a significant and well maintained                                     model for India will provide a useful tool in                                   domestic economic development planning.  The                                    proposed programme will be relevant for the                                     training of young researchers in model                                          building, macro-enonometric policy analysis,                                    data compilation, and specialized computer                                      work.                                                                                                                                                           The project is being funded under two grants:                                   University of Delhi, INT9211763                                                 University of Pennsylvania, INT9119327",
