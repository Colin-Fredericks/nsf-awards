 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Schaffner is examining theory structure and research                  strategies in molecular biology.  In order to develop a more                    general approach to these issues, he is first undertaking three                 detailed case studies:  a recent historical inquiry into the                    molecular explanation of the generation of antibody diversity;                  simple molecular learning mechanisms in Aplysia; and the genetic                control of the life cycle of the HIV virus.  These case studies are             intended to lead to a broader conceptualization of theory structure             and research strategies in molecular biology.  This                             conceptualization should include an examination of the conceptual               structure of theories, models, mechanisms, principles, and                      generalizations in molecular biology, and their relations to                    experimental results and new experimental technologies.  Professor              Schaffner is then considering ways in which these elements (e.g.                theories, models, principles . . .) change as science progresses,               and what dynamical factors drive such changes.  As part of this                 study, he is examining various heuristics for theory and model                  changes and the proposal and evaluation of laboratory experiments.",
