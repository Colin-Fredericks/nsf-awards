 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the processes which have been demonstrated for chemical                   vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond films, the radio-frequency                    thermal plasmas approach is one of the most promising in terms                  of high deposition rates, lack of contamination, and good film                  uniformity over large substrate areas.  The present work is                     directed at development of a fundamental understanding of the                   mechanisms of diamond-film CVD in an rf thermal plasma reactor                  and use of that understanding for definition of process                         conditions which will enable high-rate deposition of high-                      quality diamond films on various substrates of industrial                       interest.  Experiments will be conducted to characterize the                    effects of controllable process parameters on film properties                   and deposition rates.  On-line measurements of temperatures                     and chemical species concentrations in the boundary layer                       adjacent to the substrate and at the substrate surface itself                   will be obtained using optical pyrometry, laser-induced                         fluorescence, and gas chromatography of samples gathered with                   probes.  Analyses of the deposited films will be obtained from                  optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman                         spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.  A numerical model which                   specifically corresponds to the experimental reactor and                        conditions and which predicts film growth rates as a function                   of process variables will be developed in parallel with the                     experimental studies.                                                                                                                                           Diamond is a superlative material with respect to mechanical,                   thermal, optical, electrical, and acoustic properties.                          Deposition of diamond films on various substrates (various                      materials and shapes) is a rapidly growing field with a                         potentially huge market in such areas as machine cutting                        tools, abrasives, bearings, lasers, lenses/mirrors, and                         microelectronic devices.  The ability to produce uniform pure                   diamond coatings at high deposition rates is critical to                        future developments in this area.  This program represents an                   important step in exploration of the rf thermal plasma                          approach to such production, and will additionally advance the                  knowledge and technology base for other potential applications                  of rf thermal plasma CVD processes.",
