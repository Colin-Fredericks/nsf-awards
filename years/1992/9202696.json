The next generation of                                               supercomputers will require an increase in                                      speed.  Unfortunately, since the residual stress                                in the dielectric increases with the number of                                  layers, the reliability of the dielectric layer                                 based on current polyimides will decrease.                                      The increase in layers and the decrease in the                                  width of the circuit paths necessitates the use                                 of photosensitive polyimides which typically                                    exhibit a reduction in properties.  Thus, there                                 is a pressing need to 1) produce polyimides                                     with lower residual stress and 2) learn how to                                  optimize a mechanical design utilizing these                                    materials using structural analysis methods.                                                                                                                    First, DuPont will prepare a number of new,                                     non-photosensitive polyimides that have low                                     stress.  Then, DuPont, IBM, UMass, and                                          UNH will characterize the elastic, optical, and                                 electrical properties using several new and                                     several well established techniques.  These                                     properties will be used as input to IBM's                                       finite element model of the multilayer                                          dielectric to predict the stress level and hence                                the reliability of the new substrates.  The                                     effect of processing variables (heat, solvents,                                 etc.) on the critical physical properties will                                  also be determined.  Once a suitable range of                                   techniques and properties have been                                             established, DuPont will synthesize                                             photosensitive polyimides and the properties                                    will be characterized again.  Then, a model                                     substrate will be fabricated by IBM and the                                     thermo-mechanical performance will be                                           characterized by UNH.  The failure modes, if                                    any exist, will also be observed at UMass                                       using hot-stage optical microscopy.  This                                       combined interdisciplinary effort has been                                      made possible by the recent advances in                                         experimental methods to characterize thin film                                  materials that have been pioneered at UNH",
