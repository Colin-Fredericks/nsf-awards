 "awd_abstract_narration": "The kinetics of crystallization are, in general, controlled by two              competitive phenomena, the thermodynamic driving force, which                   forces the crystal/noncrystal interface forward, and the rate at                which the heat of fusion and any unincorporable components can flow             away from that interface.  Over a wide range of conditions, this                competition causes the interface to assume intricate patterns.  The             aim of the proposed work is to develop an experimental base and a               theoretical framework by which such pattern formation in polymer                systems can be understood.  This work will be directed at                       spherulitic crystallization in polymer blends and at the                        development of microstructure in melt-spun fibers.                                                                                                              An experimental program for quiescent crystallization will be                   carried out.  In this, both constrained (by forced movement through             a temperature gradient) and unconstrained spherulite-like growth                will be studied.  In both cases, microstructural parameters will be             measured and compared to model predictions.  Likewise, a study will             be made of the temperature and crystallite radius of oriented                   polymer fibers crystallized by running them through a temperature               gradient.  These will be compared to those of a model developed by              the principal investigator.  It is expected that the work will also             extend existing theory for pattern development in polymers.",
