 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a national need to produce capable molecular                           biologists as basic researchers, teachers and biotechnologists.                 More undergraduates--especially minorities--must be suitably                    educated and encouraged to continue as biology majors and to                    enroll in advanced courses in molecular biology.  To help                       accomplish these goals, we propose a number of approaches                       designed to increase academic success and interest in freshman                  molecular biology; to encourage student entry into the teaching                 profession; and to enhance the effectiveness of teaching                        assistants at SUNY-Binghamton as well as teachers from                          secondary schools and other colleges.  To address these needs,                  the freshman Cell and Molecular Biology courses is being                        reorganized and restructured to use historical and empirical                    approaches, to introduce cooperative learning and computer-                     constructed concept mapping, and to have laboratory classes                     that include more independent, student directed experiments.                    A training workshop and training manual focused on                              constructivist learning theory and practice is being developed                  for teaching assistants.  The effectiveness of the entire                       effort is being assessed with the help of an independent                        evaluator.",
