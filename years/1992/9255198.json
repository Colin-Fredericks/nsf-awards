 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"Scholars in Chemistry at Spelman\" will provide a                   comprehensive research and academic enrichment program for talented             minority women student interested in majoring in Chemistry or                   Biochemistry.  The first year 5 sophomores, 3 juniors, and 2                    seniors will be chosen.  Thereafter, students who have left the                 program, will be replaced with students at the sophomore level.                                                                                                 Each student's academic career will include enrichment activities               such as special weekly lectures, a visiting lecture series, seminar             participation, and professional conference attendance.                                                                                                          Two years of research experience with faculty mentors, who also                 serve as role models will culminate in a written thesis. A summer               of research experience before the junior year, as well as a summer              at an outside research facility will give scholars a strong mentor              in  her major on entry to the College.  This mentor may or may not              become her research mentor.                                                                                                                                     The College has established an Office of Science, Engineering, and              Technical Careers (OSETC) to assist in counseling, graduate school              contacts, and the application process.",
