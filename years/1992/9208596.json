 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anomalous deposition of alloys is defined by the less noble                     metal depositing preferentially to the more noble metal under                   certain conditions.  This project aims to understand the                        mechanism of anomalous codeposition in plating processes using                  experiments and mathematical modelling.  Previous work on the                   codeposition of nickel-iron suggests that change transfer in                    the monohydroxide species causes the anomaly; this work                         ascertains whether or not this mechanism can be extended to                     explain anomalous codeposition of the mutual alloys of nickel                   iron, cobalt, and zinc.  The effect of buffering the pH of the                  plating bath is also  investigated.  Mathematical modelling                     consists of two parts:  equilibrium calculations and one-                       dimensional diffusion modelling which includes the effects of                   buffering and of hydrolysis reactions.                                                                                                                          This phenomenon is most commonly encountered with the mutual                    alloys of iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc.  These alloys are                     widely used in electroplated films because of their high                        strength, hardness, and magnetic properties.  Electrodeposited                  zinc-nickel provides corrosion protection for steel; high-iron                  nickel-iron (such as Invar) is used where low thermal                           expansion is required including microwave guides. optics.                       laser housings, and printed circuit boards; ferromagnetic                       alloys such as cobalt-nickel, iron-cobalt, and nickel-iron are                  widely used in electronic and magnetic devices including                        computer memory, magnetic shielding, and magnetic recording                     heads.",
