 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hanna and Carbon coal basins of south-central Wyoming                  became structurally defined during the Laramide Orogeny.  The Hanna             Basin is unique among depocenters of the Rocky Mountain foreland                (within the province of Laramide-style deformation) in its thick                sedimentary accumulation (Upper Cretaceous through lower Eocene,>               32,000 ft) relative to its to its short map dimensions (24x40 mi).              In comparison with other Wyoming foreland depressions, the Hanna                Basin provides an extreme case in terms of rates of basinal                     subsidence, adjacent contemporaneous uplift, syntectonic                        deposition, and intervening episodes of major basin-margin erosion.             However, temporal constraints on the depositional and structural                evolution of the Hanna/Carbon basins are rudimentary.  Use of                   vertebrate fossils linked to described sections of the Ferris and               Hanna formations will provide the first detailed determinations of              (1) relative age relationships within the thick sequence of                     uppermost Cretaceous through lower Eocene strata, (2) rates of                  deposition, and (3) timing and estimates of magnitude of basinal                and basin-margin reverse-faulting and adjacent uplift.  A                       temporally controlled series of interpretive geological                         cross-sections, extending southward into the Hanna Basin from its               northerly, adjacent ranges, will be developed following completion              of surifical geological description allied with analysis of cobble              provenance.  Additional important research components of the                    Hanna/Carbon basin project include (1) paleogeographic and                      biostratigraphic interpretations of ubiquitous shark teeth                      collected from Paleocene fluvial sections of the Hanna Formation,               and (2) description and interpretation of vertebrate faunal changes             across the Mesozoic-Cenozoic boundary.  Knowledge derived from                  various elements of the project will allow, for the first time,                 quantitative comparisons of the greater Hanna Basin's evolution                 with other, better understood, Rocky Mountain foreland basins.",
