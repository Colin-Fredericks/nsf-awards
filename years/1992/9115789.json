 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this research program are to understand how              sensory information is coded and processed in the brain and how                 neural networks have been modified during evolution to produce new              behaviors.  More specifically, a primary objective is to understand             the functional significance of \"laminar\" organization in the brain,             i.e. many layers of cells.  The human cortex is an example of such              laminar organization.  To learn whether neurons of particular                   layers have different functional roles, their selectivities for                 specific sensory information and morphology must be determined.                                                                                                 Electric fish are well-suited for obtaining such information since              behavioral studies have already provided insights into this sensory             system and electric signals are easily produced in the laboratory.              Electrosensory information processing occurs within laminated                   regions of their brains and microelectrodes can be inserted into                neurons within these layers.  Such information will have general                significance to understanding how sensory information is processed              in laminated structures within more complex brains, as well.",
