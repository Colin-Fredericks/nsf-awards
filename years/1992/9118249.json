 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detailed experimental studies of the characteristic friction               distance Dc are needed to understand frictional instability and the             mechanisms of failure during earthquakes.  For bare rock surface                Dc is thought to represent the displacement necessary to change                 completely the population of surface contacts; an interpretation                supported by data showing that Dc scales with surface roughness.                In fault gouge it does not necessarily follow that contact size,                and thus Dc, will scale with surface roughness, since particle-                 surface contacts will be controlled by particle size as well as                 surface roughness.  The motivation for the experiments is the                   observation that surface roughness does affect Dc of gouge, even                after shear has localized.  Since this means that the surface                   roughness effect on Dc cannot be explained solely as a consequence              of contact size it raises the question of what controls Dc for                  sliding within gouge.  This project involves a systematic study of              the effect of surface roughness on Dc of gouge.  The work will have             two specific objectives: 1) to expand the database for the surface              roughness effect on Dc to roughnesses 10-100 times that of existing             data, and 2) to investigate the micromechanics of Dc in gouge via               detailed mechanical and microstructural measurements.",
