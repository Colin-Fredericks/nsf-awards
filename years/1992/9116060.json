Harkness; Title of                    Dissertation:  \"John Dee's Mathematical Philosophy and the                      Language of Nature.\"                                                                                                                                            The \"mathematization of nature\" is one of the major factors in                  the success of modern science.  The ability to use mathematical                 equations to describe the action of physical forces has allowed                 scientists to achieve unprecedented degrees of accuracy in their                predictions.  Yet why nature should act in ways that can be                     described mathematically is not at all obvious even today.                      Philosophical arguments continue about the \"reality\" of the                     relationships described in scientific theories.  But whether the                mathematical relations are \"real\" or not, it is clear that they                 are incredibly useful for science.  Ms. Harkness is examining                   John Dee's mathematical philosophy.  Dee was one of the first of                early modern natural philosophers who made the case for the use                 of mathematics in the study of nature.  Her study explores the                  connections between the mathematical philosophy of John Dee and                 the other facets of his natural philosophy to analyze the ways in               which mathematics became the dominant language of science during                the 17th century.  Drawing on manuscript and printed materials                  from 13 libraries in the United States and Great Britain, Ms.                   Harkness is examining Dee's intellectual corpus and is placing                  Dee's mathematical natural philosophy in the context of previous                and subsequent work on mathematics and the natural world.",
