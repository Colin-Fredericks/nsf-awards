 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crinoid skeletal elements are a rare component in modern                   seafloor sediment, but ancient crinoid ossicles are commonly                    abundant enough to be major constituents of marine rocks.  Thus,                the study of fossilization processes of separate ossicles is                    important for sedimentologists as well as for paleontologists.                       In order to determine the effects of in-place degradation of               crinoid ossicles, the elements will be glued to plexiglass plates               and fastened to concrete hemispheres on the seafloor.  Ossicles                 will also be glued to plexiglass rods buried vertically in the                  seafloor sediment to study the effects of burial.  These techniques             have already proven effective in a study of biologic degradation                over the summer months (March-September, 1991).  Infesting and                  encrusting organisms and their effects on the crinoid's calcite                 stereom are currently being studied using ossicles left on the                  seafloor for periods from 5 days to 6 months.  The proposed                     research will focus on the winter months, using the same approach.                   Transport of ossicles has not been observed directly in the                summer, but is expected to be a major part of the proposed                      research.  Dye will be released into the water, grains will be                  stained and monitored, and sediment traps designed to sample both               traction and suspended load will be used to measure ossicle                     transport directly and indirectly.  In addition, sediment samples               will be taken along transect from shore to shelf edge, and examined             for ossicles transported from their living sites.",
