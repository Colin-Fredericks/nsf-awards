 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor MaryAnn                  Jerkofsky, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular               Biology, University of Maine, to Japan for a cooperative research               project with Professor Tokuo Sano, Department of Aquatic                        Biosciences, Tokyo University of Fisheries.  The researchers plan               to undertake a study of herpesvirus and its relation to tumor                   cells in fish.  Dr. Sano has isolated two fish herpesviruses and                has demonstrated that each produces a tumor when injected into                  fish: a basal cell carcinoma for the YTV and a papilloma for CHV.               He has not grown the tumors in vitro nor characterized viral gene               expression in such cultured cells.  Professor Jerkofsky has prior               experience with the growth of viral-induced tumors in vitro and                 with characterization viral antigens present in such cells.  The                research will investigate the two potentially oncogenic                         herpesviruses in a system that may allow temperature to regulate                virus production and viral gene expression.                                                                                                                     The research results have the potential to offer new models of                  both herpesvirus pathogenesis and oncogenicity which could lead                 to better biological characterization of the viruses CHV and YTV.               The Department of Aquatic Biosciences at Tokyo's University of                  Fisheries has many ongoing fish tumor studies underway in its                   laboratories.  Professor Sano is a first-rate Japanese fish                     pathology scientist.  His experience, coupled with Professor                    Jerkofsky's expertise in the area of human herpes virology should               provide a fruitful collaboration.  It is expected that this                     collaboration will continue even after the formal agreement has                 terminated.",
