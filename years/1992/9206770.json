 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr.Michael Smith will                 conduct archaeological excavations at the Aztec-period site of                  Yautepec which is located in north-central Morelos, Mexico. The                 site, at the edge of the modern town of Yautepec consists of a                  large palace structure and 30 hectares of adjacent fields with                  traces of house remains. This is one of the only areas of a major               Aztec city anywhere in central Mexico where a district of houses is             available for excavation. The project itself has five major                     objectives: 1. The exposure of large horizontal areas of 3 to 6                 houses; 2. limited testing of another 15 or more houses; 3.                     establishment of a fine-grained chronology for the site by means of             ceramic seriation, stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates; 4.                       determination of the size and extent of the Aztec city by means of              a surface survey of the modern town of Yautepec; 5. synthesis of                the data in economic and social terms.                                                                                                                          Cities are important components of nearly all state societies and               archaeologists have long acknowledged the crucial role played by                urban centers in the origin and operation of states. Many of the                traits that distinguish states from simpler societies are also                  characteristics of cities and important political, economic and                 religious institutions are usually concentrated in urban centers.               Therefore in order to document and explain the development and                  organization of ancient states, archaeologists need to map and                  excavate cities. The Aztecs constructed one of the largest and most             impressive New World states. It was heavily urbanized yet very                  little is known about the nature of Aztec urbanism. Dr. Smith's                 project will help to solve this problem. His data have the                      potential to help resolve a number of issues involving urban                    structure, economic organization and the political processes which              characterized Mexico at this time.                                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to a large number of archaeologists and shed light             on how complex societies - including our own - arise and are                    maintained. This area is slated for urban development. Thus the                 site is threatened and research must be conducted quickly.",
