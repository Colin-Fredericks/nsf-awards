The aim is to                         improve mathematics and science education in K-8 public                         schools in three Central Florida counties.                                                                                                                      Thirty teachers per year for each of the 4 years of the                         program will participate in the Academy.                                                                                                                        Teachers will attend the equivalent of four semesters of                        courses, which will include mathematics and science content,                    pedagogical aspects of teaching mathematics and science and                     leadership training.                                                                                                                                            Teachers will be chosen in pairs from each target school.                       Follow up activities will include networking among the                          teachers in different schools and with the University                           faculty.                                                                                                                                                        Teachers will receive credits towards a Masters degree upon                     completion of the program.                                                                                                                                      Each teacher in the program will supervise and mentor an                        undergraduate education major.                                                                                                                                  Active and retired scientists will act as mentors in the                        schools.
