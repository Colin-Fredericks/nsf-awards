 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the application of two theoretical                        tools-successive linear combination algorithms and blossoming-                  to a variety of curve and surface schemes in CAGD (computer                     aided geometric design).  A successive linear combination                       algorithm is any algorithm that proceeds by taking successive                   linear combinations of (usually) pairs of points or vectors.                    Examples include the de Boor algorithm and Boehm's knot                         insertion algorithm.  Blossoming is the technique of                            associating with a polynomial curve or surface a multivariate                   multiaffine symmetric polynomial that contains information                      about the curve or surface.  The two tools are related, and                     have been applied previously to Bezier and B-spline curves and                  surfaces with great success.  Here these tools will be applied                  to many of the other curve and surface types-such as rational                   B-spline, Catmull-Rom, Chebyshev, and multivariate spline                       schemes-that are of interest to CAGD.  Successful application                   of these tools will result in derivation of new algorithms and                  new properties for these schemes, development of new surface                    schemes, simplification and unification of parts of the theory                  of CAGD, and ultimately in better practical tools for design                    and manufacture using freeform curves and surfaces.",
