 "awd_abstract_narration": "This undulator beamline will be developed, instrumentated,                      and operated at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) under the                      auspices of the Michigan/AT&T Collaborative Access Team                         (MATT-CAT).  The APS represents a very significant step                         forward for the future of materials research: for the first                     time it will be possible to carry out time-resolved studies                     of materials under real dynamic conditions.  MATT-CAT is                        conceived as a center for real-time x-ray studies which                         will operate as a joint university-industry initiative                          bringing together faculty and students at the University of                     Michigan, and research staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, to                      focus on the kinetic behavior of materials.   MATT-CAT's                        goal is to establish a center of excellence devoted to the                      structural kinetics of materials which will benefit from                        the interaction of physicists, chemists, materials                              scientists and engineers.  To accommodate this goal, two                        fully instrumented beam lines will be developed, one will                       have an undulator source, and the other a bending magnet.                       The undulator beam line is designed to achieve high                             resolution and will consist of a back-reflection                                monochromator, situated in the rear hutch, with the                             monochromated beam transported to a forward hutch.   Here,                      high-resolution analyzers and fast array detectors                              currently under development will be available for time-                         resolved scattering studies.  The extremely high                                brightness, collimation, and stability of the undulator                         beam will be exploited for new kinds of coherent                                spectroscopic measurements of non-hydrodynamic modes in                         solids and complex fluids.                                                                                                                                      This beam line will be available to the MATT-CAT members                        75-80% of the time, with the remaining time allocated to                        general users.  Technical staff will be employed in the                         construction of the beam lines, the day-to-day operation                        and upkeep of the instruments, and will assist users.",
