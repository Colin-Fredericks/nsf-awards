 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will establish a modern taxonomic base for studies             of biostratigraphy, biogeography, and evolution of the middle                   Cretaceous (Albian) faunas (predominantly ammonites) of the Pacific             rim of North America and will refine the biostratigraphic standard              of reference for this interval in the Cottonwood District of                    northern California.  A detailed standard of reference is                       prerequisite to an understanding of paleobiological problems of                 biofacies, biogeography and patterns of evolution, and for                      chronostratigraphy.  It is also needed for stratigraphic and                    structural problems requiring a high degree of biostratigraphic                 resolution.                                                                          Such a study would:  1) elucidate the microstructural,                     morphologic, and ontogenetic characteristics of many unstudied                  ammonite taxa; 2) would enable some evolutionary sequences to be                recognized and their patterns to be examined; 3) permit examination             of hypotheses of ammonite evolution proposed by German, Russian,                and French writers; 4) enable a refined correlation of the Lower                Cretaceous strata around the Pacific rim with the classical                     sections in Europe and with sequences originating in the Tethyan                seaway, e.g. Caucasus, Indian; 5) enable paleobiogeographic and                 biofacial interpretations some of which are now masked by                       antiquated taxonomy; 6) permit a better understanding of the                    history of the region and its faunas; 7) permit a more balanced                 view of the Cretaceous history of North America; 8) permit                      assessment of proposed mid-Cretaceous extinction events.",
