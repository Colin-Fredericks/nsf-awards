 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel method of net-form materials synthesis has been                    conceived and initial verification experiments have been                        successfully completed.  The method uses streams of highly uniform              droplets of molten metal which are deposited onto a substrate in                a controlled environment such as a vacuum or higher pressures of                selected gases.  The droplet deposition rate is controlled such                 that rapid solidification occurs leading to a net-formed material               with small grain size and high structural integrity.  By using                  novel droplet stream generation techniques the droplets are                     directed onto the substrate with very small angular and speed                   dispersions thereby making possible the synthesis of small detailed             parts.  Since the droplets are the same size (typically 30-150                  microns in diameter) and travel at the same speed, the absence of               pre-solidification droplets in the final product leads to a more                homogeneous, and thus higher quality part than is normally achieved             with other related techniques.  Since the solidification rate                   determines the structural integrity of the net-formed part, the                 droplet deposition rate, speeds, and sizes are parameters which                 will be varied in the study.  The homogeneity and grain structure               of the net-formed parts will be examined both optically and with                the use of an electron microscope, and their mechanical                         characteristics will be studied by subjecting formed parts to tests             in both compression and tension.                                                     The reduction of the proposal process to practice may allow                the rapid fabrication of parts directly from computer-based                     descriptions.  The resulting parts may also be produced with novel,             high strength structure.",
