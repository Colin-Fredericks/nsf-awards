 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves dissertation research by a student of                     cultural anthropology from CUNY Hunter College.   The project                   will study the production of TV programs in Shanghai in order to                understand the media's role in portraying symbols of modern                     Chinese culture.  Using ethnographic methods of participant                     observation and structured interviewing, as well as textual                     analysis, surveys and documentary research, the project will                    evaluate how some factors from the West penetrate the cultural                  consciousness of Chinese media producers while others are                       resisted or transformed.                                                              The study will help us understand how television programs                 influence local cultural identities with respect to the national                center as well as the international cultural centers.  This sort                of research is important as transnational influences become more                important.  Understanding how local intellectuals function as                   cultural brokers while trying to resolve their cultural identity                ambiguities between East and West will help members of the two                  culture areas deal successfully with each other.",
