 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to design and                    build a dynamic camera control system and processing hardware to                exercise high performance real time vision algorithms.  High                    performance is based on reformulating algorithms in log-polar                   image plane coordinates, which significantly reduces pixel count                and computations per pixel.  Capabilities of this system will                   include depth perception based on binocular stereo and optic flow               in dynamic environments.  This system can be duplicated as a                    testbed for vision researchers.  The binocular camera motion head               will be available as a self-contained module which can be                       attached to any processing architecture.                                                                                                                        Phase I has demonstrated a complete spectrum of image processing                algorithms formulated in log-polar coordinates, proving the                     feasibility and efficiency of such a system.  Orders-of magnitude               reduction in computational requirements suggest dramatic benefits               for robot vision in general and mobile robots in particular.                                                                                                    The proposed technology could improve the cost/performance ration               for robot vision systems by several order of magnitude.  This                   opens commercial niches unattainable by conventional Cartesian                  coordinate based computer vision.  Markets include autonomous                   floor cleaners, transporters, security robots, and service                      robots.",
