The model must be                                       capable of predicting the distribution of                                       surface complexes as a function of solids                                       concentration and pH and should incorporate                                     the effects of particle interactions on                                         sorption phenomena.  X-Ray absorption                                           spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy will                                   be used to determine the structure of surface                                   complexes as a function of solids                                               concentration in batch and recirculating                                        batch reactors.  The proposal leading to this                                   award was submitted in response to NSF 88-99                                    as modified by changes dated 09/19/91 to make                                   the Research Initiation Award announcement                                      consistent with changes in NSF 83-57 and                                        published as NSF 90-77.                                                                                                                                         Many environmental problems associated with                                     energy and raw material production require                                      reliable quantitative prediction of the                                         transport and dispersion of contaminants in                                     surface and groundwater systems.  Reaction of                                   contaminant solutes with mineral surfaces in                                    soils, sediments, and rocks typically causes                                    a portion of each solute to partition onto                                      the solids.  This sorption decreases solute                                     mobility, which must be accounted for in                                        transport models.  Results of this research                                     are expected to be used to formulate surface                                    complexation reactions and the resulting                                        model will be used to simulate the sorption                                     behavior of metal ions in column reactors                                       used in design of environmental pollution                                       abatement processes and systems.",
