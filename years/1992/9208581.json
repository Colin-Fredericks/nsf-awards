 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to provide a comprehensive                 empirical assessment of the \"lending\" channel of monetary policy                transmission.  According to the lending view, monetary policy                   matters not only because of its effect on transactions balances,                but also because of its impact on the supply of bank loans.                     Critical to the existence of a distinct lending channel is the                  condition that bank loans and other forms of credit, e.g., open                 market paper and trade credit, be imperfect substitutes for some                borrowers.  In other words, there can only be a distinct lending                channel if some borrowers are partially \"bank dependent.\"                                                                                                       The contribution of this project comes from a through examination               of both the aggregate and cross-sectional implications of the                   lending view.  Using aggregate data, the investigators test: 1)                 whether monetary policy can indeed move loan supply around; and 2)              whether these movements in loan supply in turn have meaningful                  consequences for investment in capital goods and inventories.  The              project uses micro data to determine whether the large inventory                swings typically seen in recessions can be attributed to monetary-              policy-induced changes in loan supply.  The project determines                  whether bank-dependent firms cut their inventories more sharply                 than do non-bank dependent firms in the wake of a monetary                      contraction.  Micro data is also used to study the responsiveness               of inter-firm trade credit extensions to monetary shocks.",
