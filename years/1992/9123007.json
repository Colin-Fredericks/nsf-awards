 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and empirical measurements suggest that much of the                    ocean's margin is net heterotrophic, that is, utilizing more                    organic matter then is produced by photosynthesis.  Seasonally,                 many continental shelves are dominated by autotrophic processes                 and may then export organic matter to the ocean's interior.  This               annual cycle of trophic status is largely the result of an                      interactive two-factor response by bacteria to low temperature                  and low substrate concentration.  Bacterial isolates from the                   Arctic Ocean, the Labrador Current, and the subtropical                         southeastern continental shelf all indicate greatly reduced rates               of growth when cultured at their annual minimum temperature and                 at low substrate concentrations, comparable to those normally                   present in seawater.  Little is known, however, about net                       metabolism in arctic marine communities.  Bacterial production is               very low during the early spring period when most primary                       production is within the sea ice, and it is higher in late summer               after the open-water phytoplankton bloom.  This understanding is                based on limited data, both seasonally and geographically.  This                project will result in an extensive concurrent data set on                      phytoplankton biomass, bacterial and microzooplankton abundance,                nutrient uptake (nitrate and ammonium), inorganic nutrient                      concentration, hydrographic variables, primary production,                      microbial secondary production, and microbial respiration in the                Arctic Ocean.  Knowledge of the autotrophy-heterotrophy stauts of               the arctic will be an important consideration for modeling the                  global carbon cycle and for predicting the effects of global                    climate change, as well as for understanding and modeling polar                 food webs.",
