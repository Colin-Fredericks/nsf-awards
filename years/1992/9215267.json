 "awd_abstract_narration": "Health care management is one of the most important research               topics in this country.  Planning activities at Arizona State                   University have developed a consortium based research Center                    program in addressing the health care management problems.                           The formation of this Center is based on the early work                    supported by the Western Network for Education in Health                        Administration.  The proposed Center program is                                 to develop an integration of industry, Arizona State University,                and the Western Network university consortium based on the NSF                  I/UCRC model.                                                                        The initial research agenda of Arizona State University's                  I/UCRC for Health Care Management will address the following                    topics:  1) Develop new ways to organize and manage patient care                units; 2) Changing relationships between physician and                          organization; 3) Implementing new approaches to managing quality                and clinical outcomes.                                                               The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues              with Arizona State University, Northwestern University, University              of Colorado, University of Washington, and U.C. Berkeley have the               knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                                         This I/UCRC Program is being coordinated with Dr. John                     Castellan, Program Director of Decision, Risk, and Management                   Science Program at the National Science Foundation.                                  The Program Manager recommends Arizona State University be                 awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.                  Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers               Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of                  renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which              the university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to             which the support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the                next period of this continuing award.",
