VELACS is                                     an NSF-funded coordinated study of the effect                                   of simulated earthquake loading on a variety of                                 model geotechnical structures, such as earth                                    dams and embankments, in order to investigate                                   the mechanisms of liquefaction-induced failure,                                 and to acquire data for the verification of the                                 various analysis procedures for the liquefaction                                problem.  The experiments are run on the                                        geotechnical centrifuges at the California                                      Institute of Technology, University of California                               at Davis, University of Colorado at Boulder,                                    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Princeton                                     University and Cambridge University, England.                                                                                                                   The \"Class A\" prediction phase of the                                           VELACS project involves making                                                  analytical/computational predictions before the                                 experiments are performed; then the                                             experiments are run, and the measured results                                   compared with the predictions.  \"Class A\"                                       predictions are analogous to \"single-blind\"                                     studies in medical research.  A workshop,                                       scheduled to be held at the University of                                       California, Davis, in September, 1993, will                                     compare the predictions to the experimental                                     results, and conclusions will be drawn regarding                                the effectiveness of the analytical/computational                               methods used.  Sixteen research groups from                                     around the world (nine in the U.S.; one in                                      Canada; three in Japan; and three in the U.K.)                                  are participating in this prediction exercise.
