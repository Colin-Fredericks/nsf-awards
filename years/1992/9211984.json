 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fisher will study                  tusk dentin laminations in a series of mammoths and mastodonts                  which lived between ca. 12,000 and 10,000 years ago in North                    America. Prior work by Dr. Fisher has shown that the tusks and                  cheek teeth of these species exhibit dentinal laminations that                  record details of individual life history. Successive orders of                 lamination represent annual, fortnightly and daily cycles in                    accreted dentin. Analyses of these patterns yield data on                       seasonal mortality, age, sex, growth rates, age at sexual                       maturity and calving. These factors are sensitive to the nature                 and degree of ecological stress to which the animal had been                    subjected and demonstrate predictable patterns of response to                   altered nutritional status and/or predation pressure. With such                 data Dr. Fisher will quantify these life history trails for the                 two species just before their time of extinction. He will compare               the results with data from extant elephants from a range of                     environments. On this basis he will determine the factors which                 led to the extinction of mammoths and mastodonts at the end of                  the Pleistocene.                                                                                                                                                It has long been known that the end of the last Ice Age saw the                 extinction of many species of animals in North America. While                   this fact is undisputed the cause has yet to be determined. While               some scientists argue that environmental change alone is                        responsible, others note that these major extinctions seem to                   coincide with the appearance of human hunter gathers in North                   America and believe that overhunting led to their demise. The                   data Dr. Fisher will collect allows, he believes, for a                         distinction between these possible causes.                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 paleoanthropologists with insight into prehistoric human behavior               and subsistence patterns. It will also shed light on the                        relationships between human predation, environmental exchange and               species extinction, a problem of major significance today.",
