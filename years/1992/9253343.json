 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the program is to enhance the effectiveness of                      high school physics teachers in their use of the computer in                    the classroom and laboratory both for instruction and                           computation.  This will be accomplished via two distinct but                    inter-related activities:                                                            * The evaluation of physics software for the use                                of all physics teachers.                                                        * A Teacher Institute for empowering leadership                                 teachers to use the software and achieve full                                   utilization of computers in the teaching of                                     physics.                                                                                                                                                   The software evaluation component will provide independent ,                    timely, reliable and comprehensive guides to currently                          available courseware for high school physics teachers.                          These reviews will be disseminated by publication in The                        Physics Teacher and by contributed presentations and                            workshops given locally and nationally.                                                                                                                         The institute will provide intensive hands-on activity in                       the use of the latest Microcomputer Based Laboratory(MBL)                       interfaces, spreadsheets and sample exercises, and                              courseware materials for classroom demonstrations and                           student assignments.                                                            Each summer two sessions will be organized with 12                              leadership teachers in each. The sessions will be of three                      weeks duration at the Physics Courseware Laboratory of North                    Carolina State University.  During the following year staff                     members will make two follow-up visits to the teachers high                     schools and the following summer the teachers will return to                    NCSU for two weeks of review and assessment.  A total of 48                     nationally selected high school teachers will be able to                        participate in this three year project. During the first and                    second academic years the leadership teachers will be                           expected to conduct a total of 4 workshops and to give at                       least one presentation at a professional meeting on the                         utility of computers to teach physics. It is expected that a                    total of about 2000 teachers will receive information about                     the utility of computers in physics instruction.                                                                                                                Cost sharing is equal to 17% of NSF funding requested.",
