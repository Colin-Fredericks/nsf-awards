 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop new numerical methods                        to model weak solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic differential                    equations derived from a set of conservation laws. Conservation                 form of the system is widely held as imperative for consistent                  numerical capturing of shocks.  In practice, while this may be                  true for flows dominated by strong shocks, other flow phenomena                 may be better modelled by different, not necessarily conservative               flow descriptions. In such cases, one may be prepared to                        sacrifice strict conservation in favor of a nonstrictly                         conservative model that describes better the dominant flow                      features. To be reliable, the model should generate acceptably                  small conservation errors. The investigator shows that                          propagating fronts is one such phenomenon. Capturing propagating                fronts by conservative models gives rise to oscillations and                    other inaccuracies near material fronts, and is in general                      unsatisfactory. These are not the common oscillations associated                with high order schemes, but rather a result of the simple wave                 model (i.e. eigenstructure) of the conservative systems. A remedy               is to use a nonconservative flow description, which offers a                    different eigenstructure.  It becomes exact near contact surfaces               and produces clean oscillation-free interfaces. Near shocks, the                model is not exact and conservation errors are committed. A                     technique recently developed by the investigator offers a cure to               this problem. It uses viscous perturbations that render the                     algorithm conservative to the order of numerical approximation                  and generate acceptably small conservation errors. The technique                has been successfully applied to computing propagating fronts in                1D.  The investigator will study several theoretical aspects of                 this nonstrictly conservative algorithm and its application to                  the computation of bubble dynamics in several space dimensions.                      The work of the project involves theoretical analysis and                  computer simulation of flows. These arise in physical phenomena                 involving mixing of fluids, the initiation and evolution of                     vortices, the ignition and evolution of chemical reactions in                   fluids, and the propagation of flames. The aim of the project is                to develop analytical and computational tools to enhance the                    understanding of the complicated physical phenomena involved.                   Insight gained this way will supplement experimental data, which                are often expensive, difficult or even dangerous to obtain. For                 example, wind tunnel simulations of space conditions in the upper               stratosphere are difficult and expensive to perform and may give                unreliable results; studying gun ballistics requires                            experimenting with strong explosions, which are both expensive                  and dangerous.  Potential impact of this project extends to a                   variety of industries including the space and aircraft industries               (design of space vehicles and of aicraft wings), marine industry                (design of boats with improved hydrodynamic properties, the                     effect of bubbles on submarine hydrodynamics, etc.) and the                     weapon industries (e.g., internal ballistics of guns).",
