 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the founding of the American Republic, patent policy has been              recognized as being critical for the economic well-being of this                country.  Yet there is a real tension on where the rewards for                  inventing should belong:  with the individual inventor or with                  companies that promote innovation.  In 1962, for example, Senator               McClellan, chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Patents,                      Trademarks, and Copyrights, raised the possibility of introducing               legislation to \"restore the patent system, in at least some                     measure, to its traditional role of rewarding the inventor, in                  order the better to carry out the constitutional objective of                   `promoting the progress of science and useful arts.'\"  McClellan                was worried that the rise of the corporate research establishment               had caused the employer to interpose \"himself between the                       individual inventor and the patent system, with the former                      appropriating the patent rights and the latter often being rewarded             by nominal monetary grants or other recognition.\"  Senator                      McClellan's concern remains an issue to this day.  In order to                  reach any conclusions about this issue, it is critical that there               be studies of the experiences of other nations with differing                   policies.  Dr. Gispen, with his study of patenting policies in 20th             century Germany, is examining one of the most interesting and                   important cases of contrasting policies.                                                                                                                        Dr. Gispen is looking specifically at the vexed relationship                    between German fascism and technology, specifically the policies of             the Nazi regime toward inventors and industrial scientists and its              efforts to steer and accelerate technological progress through                  social and patent legislation.  To place the study in the widest                possible perspective, Dr. Gispen is employing a long-term analysis              covering the entire first six decades of the 20th century.  He is               also providing a comparative dimension, contrasting German                      developments with conditions in the United States and other                     European countries.  The project's principal research technique is              historical-empirical.  He is analyzing both qualitative and                     quantitative published and unpublished sources concerning the                   social conditions of German inventors and the sociopolitical                    struggles about the reform of German intellectual property law                  between 1900 and 1960.  The project's goal is to gain a deeper                  understanding of National Socialist technology policy and of the                nature and evolution of Germany's technological culture during the              period studied.  This study will result in a better understanding               of the Nazi regime's place in the historical development of modern              Germany, the changing position of the German technical professions,             and the strengths and weaknesses of Germany's technological                     culture.",
