 "awd_abstract_narration": "The orientation and navigation behavior of vertebrate animals is                remarkable in its complexity and reliance on multiple,                          interacting cues.  The system enables animals to respond flexibly               to the variety of environmental conditions that may be                          encountered during a migratory journey.  This flexibility in                    behavior enables the animal to perform accurately in the face of                variability and changing availability of the cues upon which it                 relies.  Only in birds have the relationships among orientation                 cues been explored in detail.                                                                                                                                   How does a young bird come to possess a suite of compasses                      sufficient, on its first migration, to successfully determine in                which direction to fly?  Dr. Able will employ a developmental                   approach to this problem, hand-raising birds under controlled                   conditions in which their experiences with relevant orientation                 cues (earth's magnetic field, sun, stars, polarized-light                       patterns in the sky) can be manipulated.  In this way Dr. Able                  can delineate the interactions and calibrations that occur during               the development of compass-orientation abilities in the young                   animal.  As in most complex behavior, this development involves a               rich interplay of genetically-based predispositions and templates               with experience and learning.                                                                                                                                   The research will contribute importantly both to improved                       understanding of the development of complex behavior, and to a                  greater understanding of bird migration that will be crucial in                 efforts to conserve neotropical migratory birds.",
