 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 Chemistry Program, focusses on the use of lanthanide ion                        luminescence to investigate diffusion-enhanced energy transfer                  between lanthanide energy donors and inorganic acceptors. The                   objective is to develop an understanding of resonant exchange                   energy transfer previously shown to dominate these systems and                  of chiral discrimination in the energy transfer between chiral                  lanthanide and chiral inorganic ions.  Also to be examined are                  lanthanide complexes as intercalation agents for probes of                      double-helical DNA and as targeted MRI agents, further studies                  of the photophysics of sensitized luminescence for immunoassay                  analytical applications, and characterization of siderophore                    and model siderophore complexes of lanthanide ions.  Molecular                  mechanics/dynamics calculations will be used to direct the                      design of certain reagents, particularly in chiral recognition                  and DNA intercalation.                                                          %%%                                                                             This project is concerned with the use of the special                           luminescence characteristics of lanthanide ions that result                     from laser irradiation to examine a variety of chemical events                  and to develop improved methods that may have potential for the                 study of metal ion-protein and metal ion-DNA interactions, and                  ultimately for clinical analyses.",
