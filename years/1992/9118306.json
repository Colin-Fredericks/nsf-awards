 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to expand the analysis of a                   gene that is required for the initiation of trichome                            differentiation.  This gene, GL1, was isolated and initially                    characterized during the previous granting period.  It was found                that the predicted polypeptide encoded by GL1 is homologous to                  the Myb class of transcriptional activators.  Interestingly, the                gene appears to be expressed in stipules, which develop at the                  base of the leaves, but not in leaf primordia where trichomes                   develop.  This result suggests that GL1 may be involved in the                  production of a diffusible signal that activates trichome                       formation.  Experiments are proposed to confirm or negate the                   stipule-derived, trichome morphogen hypothesis.  The PI also                    examine the mechanism behind the reduction in trichome formation                that is found in plants that contain a 35S-GL1 gene.  Other                     experiments are designed to identify the sequences that mediate                 the temporal and spatial regulation of GL1, to begin to identify                genes that encode proteins that interact with GL1 promoter or                   that directly interact with the GL1 protein.  In addition,                      experiments are planned to determine if GL1 is regulated                        appropriately in other plant species and to begin the                           characterization of other members of the Arabidopsis myb gene                   family.",
