In its first                                     year the program will recruit 12 promising                                      students:  six entering freshmen, four                                          entering sophomores, two entering juniors and                                   zero entering seniors.  The key elements of                                     the program include the following:  early                                       socialization of students in a mentored                                         research experience with teacher-scholars who                                   are experienced in mentoring undergraduate,                                     especially minority, students in research;                                      networking and academic enrichment experiences                                  including informal discussions with minority                                    scientists; academic support services                                           including advising.  Each aspect of the                                         program will emphasize the importance of                                        networking, but the core of the proposed                                        program is early intervention with a focus on                                   the research experience.  Each student will                                     have the opportunity to select a faculty                                        mentor from the areas of cell and molecular                                     biology, cell physiology, cellular                                              biochemistry or photochemistry.  FUSE students                                  will work closely with faculty mentors on                                       individual research projects and are                                            encouraged to prepare presentations of their                                    research at local and national scientific                                       meetings.",
