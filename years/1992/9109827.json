 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goal of this research is to compare                              astrocyte-neuron interactions in the adult mammalian brain.  A                  long held theory concerning one of the roles of astrocytes is                   that they support neuronal structure and function.  One way in                  which this might be accomplished is by altering their morphology                to influence the chemical and physical communication between                    neurons by modulating dendritic arbors, synaptic contacts, and                  neuronal subgroupings.  Proposed experiments will use a model                   system in the brain where activity-related structural                           reorganization of astrocytes and neurons has already been shown                 to occur in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON).  The                     studies proposed in this application are to test the following                  hypotheses:  that SON astrocytes undergo 3-dimensional shape                    changes as a result of neuronal function; that SON astrocytes                   receive neurochemical signals from neurons that induce shape                    changes; that SON astrocytes send neurochemical signals to                      neurons to influence their shape at the appropriate times; and                  that newly proliferated astrocytes contribute to the                            3-dimensional restructuring of the SON.  Several methods that                   will include light and electron microscopy, fura-2 imaging (a                   measure of intracellular ionic calcium concentrate) of primary                  astrocyte cultures, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry will               be used to define the nature of astrocyte-neuron configurations                 and the conditions affecting changes in their morphological                     relationships.  These studies are important because although they               address basic mechanistic questions, they will lead towards                     understanding how the adult brain adapts to experience, and                     eventually may lead to an understanding of mechanisms of recovery               from brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as degenerative                    brain diseases.",
