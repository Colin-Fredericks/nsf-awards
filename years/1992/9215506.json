Gani Ilahude, Chief,                 Oceanography Division, Research and Development Centre for                      Oceanology, Jakarta, Indonesia, to visit the United States to                   plan, for a period of one month, with Dr. Arnold L. Gordon,                     Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Columbia University,                     collaborative research on Indonesian Ocean Circulation and                      Mixing.  The two collaborators also will finalize research                      reports on a 1991 research cruise and report their results at an                American Geophysical Union Meeting in San Francisco, in December                1992.                                                                                                                                                           The study of the throughflow of Pacific Ocean water into the                    Indian Ocean via straits in the Indonesian Archipelago is a                     matter of great scientific interest in gaining an understanding                 global ocean circulation.   The two collaborators are highly                    respected scientists who have outstanding records of research in                the field of this project.  The present project and the research                which they will plan will allow them to combine their talents for               mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives of                  the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                      increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                   engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through                the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                      techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.  Support of Dr. Gordon's participation  in this project                is provided through an award from the NSF Division of Ocean                     Sciences.",
