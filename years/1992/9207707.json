 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are engaged in ongoing research in set                   theory, descriptive set theory, topology, and analysis.  Part of                this research will be conducted by the investigators separately and             part will be conducted jointly.  A main line of research for                    Jackson continues the development of the structural theory for the              model L(R) assuming determinacy.  This includes pushing the current             theory further, as well as refining the theory at the projective                levels.  Jackson will also work on problems in other areas of set               theory.  The investigators will work jointly on problems in                     descriptive set theory, the theory of equivalence relations, and                problems both set-theoretic and topological in nature.  Some                    examples include the determinacy transfer problem at the odd                    levels, questions about metrizable continua with sigma-finite                   linear Hausdorff measure, and the existence of natural norms on                 K(X), the n-dimensional kernel of a complex metric space.  Mauldin              will also investigate some problems in the theory of random                     homeomorphisms, for example:  for one natural method for producing              circle homeomorphisms, do almost all homeomorphisms of the unit                 circle have periodic orbits?  Are there natural methods which                   produce homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers?                             Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the                 ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising               how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the               questions that can be asked about this structure.  Descriptive set              theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the                machinery of modern mathematical logic.  For example, a standard                construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting             of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the              Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing                        complexity.  One of the obvious applications of the theory is to                locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in             analysis, say the set of points at which a function is                          differentiable.  In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of              descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of               differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel                 hierarchy.  A central concern of the investigators are questions of             this character, i.e. questions which make logic relevant to the                 wider world of mathematics.",
