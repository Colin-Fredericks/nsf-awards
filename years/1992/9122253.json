 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project centers on theoretical and empirical models of the                 labor markets.  It builds on the large collection of research on                search models of the labor market.  Recent work in equilibrium                  search models has shown that monopsony arises naturally in search               models, with the degree of monopsony power depending upon the                   matching technology.  A simple model in which wage dispersion                   arises in equilibrium even with homogeneous workers and firms will              be considered.  With this model, the statistical issues arising in              estimation will be explored, using techniques recently introduced               in the partial equilibrium search framework.  Extensions to make                the model more realistic will be examined, and data from the Survey             of Income Program Participation and other sources will be fitted                to the model.  Three specific applications will be studied: 1) the              measurement of local monopsony power; 2) aggregate labor market                 dynamics; and 3) the public finance implications of Unemployment                Insurance changes on equilibrium labor market behavior.                                                                                                         This approach to the study of labor markets is particularly                     important because it provides a way of asking whether \"thin\" labor              markets have an effect on wages, and, ultimately, upon economic                 development in non-urban areas.  For example, planners in rural                 areas commonly argue that it is difficult to attract a skilled                  labor force.  This research provides the tools with which one can               answer this question.",
