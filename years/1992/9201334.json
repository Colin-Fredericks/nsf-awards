 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Chemistry Division, Rodriguez will                       explore, quantify, and document the effect of a liquid or solid                 medium on the static and dynamic optical properties of                          porphyrins as well as on other comparable large molecules such                  as laser dyes.  In this study, the dynamic and static optical                   properties of porphyrins in the vapor phase will be compared                    with those measured in the condensed phase using static and                     time-resolved methods that span the femtosecond- to second-time                 scales.  Properties of interest include vibrational dynamics,                   charge-transfer processes, and van der Waals interactions with                  condensed-phase media.                                                          %%%                                                                             Much of our present understanding of the behavior of large                      molecular systems is based on experimental data acquired on                     these molecules in liquid or solid hosts.  However, the                         interaction of the molecules with the host can modify their                     behavior, and little effort has been devoted to document the                    magnitude of these effects.  The results of these                               investigations under this Minority Initiation project will                      provide a framework for judging the effects of these media on                   various systems, including biologically important processes.",
