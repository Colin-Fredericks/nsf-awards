 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Northeast Missouri State                       University (NMSU) Science Division to establish an NSF-REU program.             During the summer of 1992 eight undergraduate students will be                  given financial support to allow them to participate in an                      intensive, full-time research experience.   As demonstration of its             strong commitment to undergraduate research, NMSU will provide a                number of commitments, including:  clerical support, free on-campus             room and board and a waiver of tuition and fees for 3 college                   credits to student participants.                                                                                                                                Students, 4 from NMSU and 4 from off-campus, and faculty mentors                will form a research team, focusing on the study of a single                    system:  grass/fungi endosymbioses.  Students will be selected                  based on their research potential and capability, their                         independence and motivation, and their professional goals.                      Discussions between student and mentor will form the basis for                  matching students to specific research areas.  Students will work               in research areas that range widely from chemical analysis of                   fungal alkaloids, to ecological implications for grasses of                     harboring a fungus, to effects of fungal alkaloids on insect and                mammalian consumers of the fungus.  The central focus will                      integrate study at different levels of biological organization and              will help foster unity and community among group members.  The                  program includes several opportunities for students to communicate              about their work, including a required oral presentation of their               findings, and is aimed to develop project ownership by the student.",
