 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal grant for theoretical study of electronic                     transport phenomena in disordered systems having strong electron-               electron interactions.  Effective field theoretic models will be                developed, and studied using perturbative techniques and the                    renormalization group.  Specifically, this research will center on              two problems in superconductivity and three problems involving                  metal-insulator and related problems in normal systems.  The issues             in superconductivity are the supression of conventional                         superconductivity by strong disorder and the possibility of exotic              superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems.  The work in             normal conductors is aimed at enhancing current understanding of                zero temperature phase transitions in doped semiconductors.                     %%%                                                                             This ongoing research project will study transport of electric                  current in several types of materials.  The unifying theme is that              the interactions between the charge carriers is strong.  Such                   materials are potentially among the brightest opportunities for new             practical application, and are little understood at the present                 time.  This project will investigate fundamental issues of this                 class of materials which will form much of the intellectual                     infrastructure for their future application.",
