 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical forests in Latin America are disappearing at a rate               higher than in any other region of the world.  The causes of                    deforestation vary with local conditions, but include conversion                of forest to agriculture or pasture lands, logging, and the                     expansion of human settlements.  One argument for preservation of               tropical forests is that local, regional, and global climates may               be altered by the loss of forest cover.  Forests act as climate                 regulators, influencing the nature and pattern of temperature and               precipitation.  Deforestation changes the radiation budget and                  microclimate of a local area, but the magnitude and spatial                     extent of the change is poorly known.  It is even less clear how                precipitation regimes may be affected.  Also, little research has               been conducted on the influence of tropical forests on local and                regional climates outside of the Amazon Basin, although the rate                of deforestation is greater in Mexico and Central America.  This                project will examine the microclimatic, local, and regional                     effects of deforestation in the Lancandon Forest of Chiapas,                    Mexico.  It will involve an analysis of historical climate data                 for the region, a synoptic-scale analysis of the regional                       climate, and a micro level study of local meteorology in forest                 and cleared areas to document the effects of deforestation.                          This project will contribute to an understanding of how                    tropical forests and climate interact, the geographical scale                   over which these interactions are important, and it will assess                 the implication of deforestation for agricultural and                           conservation policies in environmentally sensitive areas.",
