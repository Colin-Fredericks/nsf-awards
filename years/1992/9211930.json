 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to understand the                        relationships between leaping behaviors and the design of the limb              skeleton in living and fossil primates.  Leaping behaviors have                 been hypothesized to be an important component in the evolution of              modern primates.  This research will clarify form-function                      relationships in living prosimians by examination of mechanically               important aspects of leaping behaviors and limb longbones. Analysis             of captive galagine and lemurid leaping will be based on                        qualitative kinematic descriptions of videotaped locomotor                      sequences.  Mechanically sensitive aspects of limb longbones,                   including cortical bone cross-sectional area and geometry, will be              determined from measurements made on radiographs of museum                      specimens.  Form-function relations demonstrated in living species              will allow inferences of the locomotor adaptations of the earliest              modern primates to be made.",
