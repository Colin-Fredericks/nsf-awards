 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major assumption of classical economic theory is that production              is governed by constant returns to scale.  This assumption forces               us to ignore one of the central features of economic life in the                last two centuries: the large industrial firm whose size is based               on the economic advantages of large-scale production.                                                                                                           Economists have long held the opinion that efficiencies of large-               scale production were caused by indivisibilities, i.e., large,                  lumpy aggregates of capital -- assembly lines, railroad and                     telephone networks, oil pipelines, bridges -- whose economic                    advantages could not be realized at low levels of production.                                                                                                   Indivisibilities can be introduced into a linear programming                    problem by requiring that some or all of the variables of choice                be restricted to integer values; the resulting programming problems             are extraordinarily difficult to solve.  One of the major projects              of the present proposal is the development of a new algorithm for               the solution of the general integer programming problem, which                  seems, from preliminary experience, to perform exceptionally well               on classes of problems which cannot be solved by earlier methods.               The investigator will also attempt to provide an economic                       interpretation of this algorithm in terms of the internal                       organization of the large-scale firm.",
