 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the work of three researchers                          investigating several areas of broad mathematical interest and                  importance.  Some work will be conducted jointly while other will               be addressed by single investigators.  One can divide the studies               into three main themes: nonlinear partial differential equations,               wavelet analysis and complex function theory.  In the first,                    efforts will be made to explore how the one-dimensional quantum                 version of the inverse scattering methods which replace the                     classical action-angle variables can be applied to understanding                the corresponding higher dimensional systems.  Work is also                     progressing on the investigation of inverse geophysical problems                involving surface wave phenomena.  Progress on model scalar cases               suggests that analysis of the full system of equations can be                   obtained.                                                                            Studies of adapted wave form analysis, a collection of FFT-                like adapted transform algorithms, continues to discover and                    refine new orthonormal bases which decompose functions and                      operators into almost diagonal form.  The interplay between these               theoretical advances and the application to numerical signal                    processing has led to highly successful decomposition techniques                using entropy based stopping time searches.  The applications                   lead, in turn, to a host of new questions in harmonic analysis.                 One of these will be that of creating a new concept of                          theoretical dimension of a function designed to measure the                     number of parameters necessary to describe the function with wave               forms taken from a given library.  Studies on the fine structure                of harmonic measure also continue.  Here the goals are to find                  the asymptotic behavior of harmonic measure in a variety of                     settings.                                                                            Work will also be done estimating the length of level lines                of the Green's function on bounded simply connected domains.  It                is believed that level line length varies with the fourth root of               the value of constancy.                                                              Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                     expressing solutions.  Harmonic analysis focuses on the                         decomposition of functions into component parts which best                      reflect their oscillatory characteristics, while complex function               theory seeks to describe the geometric and analytic properties of               differentiable functions of a complex variable and their                        generalizations to higher dimensions.",
