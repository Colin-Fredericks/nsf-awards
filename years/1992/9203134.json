 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop algorithms for                     identifying a low-order phase-type distribution which matches,                  exactly or as nearly as possible, given specifications such as                  moments.  The motivation for the research is the extensive                      literature on stochastic models based on phase-type distributions.              Many of these models may be solved by straight forward algorithms.              If these are to be used in applications, then methods are needed                for specifying the phase-type distributions involved.  There is                 much research underway on fitting phase-type distributions,                     motivated by the algorithms available for them.  This research                  emphasizes fitting low-order distributions.  The reason for this                emphasis is that the size of the state space of a model, and hence              also the computational burden in solving it, typically depend                   multiplicatively on the orders of the phase-type distributions used             in the model.  Thus it is important to keep the order as small as               possible.  This direction in fitting phase-type distributions has               not been explored systematically to date.                                            The techniques are largely based on recent developments in the             theory of phase-type distributions.  Bringing these ideas to bear               on the practical problem of fitting low-order phase-type                        distributions is an important step in the development of the phase              methodology.",
