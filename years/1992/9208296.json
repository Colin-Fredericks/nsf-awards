 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research aimed at                      exploiting newly discovered relationships between the classical                 theory of quasiregular mappings and nonlinear elliptic systems of               variational equations.  Quasiregular mappings first appeared as a               modest branch of complex function theory (quasiconformal                        mapping).  The mappings are characterized geometrically by the                  property that they carry infinitesimal spheres into infinitesimal               ellipsoids.  In the second half of this century it was discovered               that these mappings proved to be fundamental objects in geometry,               such a Teichmuller theory, as well as to other areas of analysis.                     The present work focuses on how the Donaldson - Sullivan                  work on quasiconformal four-manifolds has led to new techniques                 applicable to questions in nonlinear partial differential                       equations.  One of the first objectives of this work is to                      understand what, if any, distinctions arise in the study of                     quasiregular mappings defined on even and odd dimensional spaces.               Some of the deeper new discoveries are only known in the even                   dimensional case.  Arguments based on Hodge decompositions and                  Cacciappoli type inequalities may yield additional information                  about odd dimensions.                                                                A second application of quasiregular mappings relates to                   vector-valued analogues of singular integral transformations                    consisting of matrices whose elements are Riesz transforms.  It                 is believed that the p-norms of these operators do not depend on                the dimension of the underlying space. Although it may be                       impossible to achieve exact values for the norms, work will be                  done in showing that the bounds are dimension-free.  To achieve                 this, a new technique called the complex method of rotation has                 been introduced which applies to a broad class of integral                      operators in estimating their mapping norms.                                         Finally work of a more geometric nature will continue on the               questions of the maximum dimension of removable sets for                        quasiregular mapping and how Hausdorff dimension is distorted                   under such maps.",
