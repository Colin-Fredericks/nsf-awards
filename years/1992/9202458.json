The goal  of this research is to better understand the interactive process of  human language use with a computer system.  The theory underlying  this research is that human-computer interaction, like human  communication, falls into a class of coordinated actions that  proceeds by the systematic exchange of evidence of understanding.   Two processes are examined:  a) entrainment, which is hypothesized  to influence lexical choice, and b) grounding, which is  hypothesized to set the level and placement of appropriate  feedback.  Psychological experiments will use simulated language  and voice interfaces to examine 1) what variables influence the  lexical choice people make and how such a system might adapt to  idiosyncratic language input, 2) what kind of text output should  the system generate to present itself as a coherent dialog partner,  and 3) what kinds of context-sensitive feedback should a speech or  language interface provide.  The goals are to contribute to the  design of adaptive user interfaces, to enable more robust error  handling, and to make natural language, command, and voice  interfaces easier for people to use.",
