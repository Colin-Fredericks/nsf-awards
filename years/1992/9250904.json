 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project encompasses the development of equipment and                       experiments for teaching the behavior of structures under                       dynamic loading conditions to undergraduate engineers.  The                     laboratory development augments the facilities available in an                  existing laboratory which is used to teach behavior of                          structures under static loads.  Tests begin with simple free                    vibration experiments demonstrating how dynamic parameters                      characterizing motion are measured, progressing through                         structures subjected to forced vibration caused by dynamic                      forces (e.g., wind loads) or base motion (e.g., by an                           earthquake), and application of vibration reduction techniques                  (e.g., by use of dampers and base isolators).  Small-scale                      structures will be used in most of the experiments, but in at                   least one experiment, the students will evaluate the dynamic                    performance of an existing prototype structure.  The overall                    objectives in conducting such tests include:  (1) enabling the                  student to understand dynamic structural behavior and related                   theories; (2) teaching the students the use of modern dynamic                   testing equipment and data acquisition facilities; and (3)                      serving as a motivational force and as a general enrichment of                  their educational experience.  Instruments will provide state-                  of-the-art experience and yet will be easy to use.  The                         experiments which can be performed are essentially unlimited                    and can be changed to meet changing curricular needs at no                      additional cost.",
