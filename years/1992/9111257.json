The ability                              to model devices beforehand permits better use of                               limited resources and increase the assurance that                               devices which are fabricated will operate as desired.                           However, not all important devices are easily                                   simulated on existing device modelling programs.                                Computer simulation programs for high speed                                     InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors are meager in                                   spite of the importance of these devices to optical                             fiber communications and to other scientific                                    applications.  A simulation program for high speed                              InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors will be created                                 using finite element methods.  The program will be                              designed to model the DC characteristics, initially,                            of these devices in any of the three spatial                                    dimensions and lay the groundwork for an                                        extension of the model to AC operation.  The                                    model will also permit the use of nontraditional                                materials in photodetector design.  The importance                              of the work will be enhancement of the ability to                               perform fast yet innovative research on these                                   devices.",
