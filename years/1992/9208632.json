 "awd_abstract_narration": "In large and evolving software systems, tools such as                       compilers, testers, and debuggers require that static                           information be maintained and updated.  Data flow analysis                      algorithms, which gather facts about use and definition of data                 in programs, are a major source of this information.                            Incremental update algorithms, which only calculate information                 affected by the program changes, avoiding total recalculation,                  efficiently provide consistent documentation for a large,                       evolving software system.                                                            In previous research, implementation of incremental                        analysis for C systems has been hampered by the imprecision of                  the known techniques for determining pointer-induced aliases.                   This research aims at developing more precise interprocedural                   analyses of C systems, based on the conditional analysis                        approach of our pointer aliasing approximation algorithm.                       Specifically, it is planned to:                                                                                                                                           o  optimize the interprocedural pointer aliasing                                   approximation algorithm,                                                                                                                                     o  develop a new, interprocedural modification side                                effect analysis algorithm for C-like languages and                              design other flow sensitive data flow analyses                                  (e.g., interprocedural reaching definitions, static                             program slicing),                                                                                                                                            o  build a second prototype incremental MOD analyzer                               for C systems and profile its performance on actual                             C systems, and                                                                                                                                               o  study issues involved in scaling up for                                         programming-in-the-large.",
