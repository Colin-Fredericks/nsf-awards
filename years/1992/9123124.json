 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new quantum mechanics, discovered, elaborated and interpreted               during the years 1925-28, radically transformed science and                     philosophy of the 20th century.  Dr. Beller is continuing her study             of the intellectual and psycho-social history of the quantum                    revolution.  This project covers two periods in the development of              new quantum physics and its philosophy:  the formative stage (1925              -28), which Dr. Beller is describing in terms of a network of                   dialogues; and the consolidation stage (after 1928), which she is               studying by focusing on the rhetorical aspect of the articulation               of the new quantum philosophy.                                                                                                                                  Dr. Beller has already studied many of the primary and secondary                sources in the history of quantum physics and has published a                   series of papers on this topic.  Under a previous grant, she                    devoted the academic year 1990-91 to this project.  Under this                  grant, she is continuing her study of the sources pertaining to the             consolidation stage of this research.  Her results will be of great             interest for both history and philosophy of science.",
