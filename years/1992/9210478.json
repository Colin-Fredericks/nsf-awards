 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of movement is accomplished by the coordinated activity             of many different brain nuclei, which are discrete collections of               brain cells or neurons. One system of brain nuclei that make                    important contributions to the function of movement in general is               the basal ganglia. Recently it has been shown that the basal                    ganglia help to control eye movements as well as other types of                 movements. Signals from the basal ganglia are known to project to               lower brainstem structures that control the detailed execution of               saccadic eye movements, which are rapid, ballistic-like eye                     movements that are made in order to rapidly change the direction                of gaze. Another pathway by which the basal ganglia can influence               eye movements is via a projection to nuclei of the thalamus. Such               signals are then propagated to selected parts of the neocortex                  where more complex aspects of eye movements are regulated. In this              award to Dr. Thomas Gardiner, signals transmitted to the thalamus               from the basal ganglia will be studied to understand the type of                controls that the basal ganglia has over eye movements via pathways             from the thalamus to the neocortex. Recordings of activity will be              made from neurons in thalamic regions which receive basal ganglia               input in relation to the performance of both saccadic eye                       movements, as described above, and pursuit eye movements, which are             the smooth, slow movements that allow visual tracking of moving                 objects. This work will contribute important knowledge about how                the central nervous system controls eye movements.",
