 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide critical operational support and                related scientific applications for TOGA/COARE using McIDAS (Man-               computer Interactive Data Access System) workstations.  The                     TOGA/COARE Intensive Observing Period (IOP) will take place in a                data sparse region of the far Western Tropical Pacific from                     November 92 through February 93.  TOGA/COARE must rely on satellite             imagery and global circulation model (GCM) analyses and forecasts               for making daily operational decisions during the IOP.  McIDAS is               the most advanced tool for synthesizing satellite imagery with                  thermodynamic and dynamic fields anlayzed by GCM and and regional               models.                                                                                                                                                              As part of this project, scientific and logistic support will              be provided during the IOP with two dedicated McIDAS workstations.              Most data will be obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology McIDAS in             Australia with some additions from the Wisconsin McIDAS through                 Internet.  McIDAS workstations will be placed at two key locations:             the COARE Operations Center in Townsville, Queensland, Australia                and in Honiara, Guadacanal, Solomon Islands, where critical                     operational decisions will be made.                                                                                                                                  Besides providing all available data, analyses, and forecasts              during the IOP, this project includes a series of pre-IOP and past              IOP studies.  The pre-IOP study will compare GCM analyses and                   forecasts to satellite imagery from the year before COARE to                    evaluate the models and assess forecasting skill.  The past IOP                 study will focus on summarizing the weather and cloud events of the             IOP and completing the GCM evaluations begun in the pre-IOP.  The               comparisons of analyses and model forecasts made during the IOP.",
