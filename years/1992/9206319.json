 "awd_abstract_narration": "The value of symmetry in mathematics is universally                        recognized as one of the great concepts used in the analysis of                 complex problems.  In nature as well as in abstraction, the most                symmetric choice for a solution often turns out to be the correct               one or the most favorable among all candidates.  Work to be done                on this project continues an extended program in the development                of a unified theory of symmmetrization deriving from a certain                  master inequality formulated and proved in 1974 (with antecedents               going back to the fifth book of Pappus, at least) .  Particular                 emphases will be placed on extremal problems from complex                       function theory, partial differential equations and                             quasiconformal mapping.  Examples include finding the best                      constant in Landau's covering theorem giving the best inequality                between the diameter of the image of a holomorphic function and                 its derivative at some point.  In partial differential equations,               work will be done in determining the shape of those domains of                  fixed diameter which minimize the heat kernel.  The distortion of               quasiconformal maps in any given direction is well documented.                  Very little is known on the limitations of how these maps can                   distort area.  Work will focus on this question.                                     It is axiomatic in mathematics that by asking the right                    questions, one is often led to the answer of a difficult question               with comparative ease.  Often right questions involve new                       insights into symmetry.  The purpose of this research is to                     continue expanding the scope of general symmetry principles which               have the potential for broad applicability.",
