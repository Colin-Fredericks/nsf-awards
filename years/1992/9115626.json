 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Paul F.              Lurquin of Washington State University and Drs.  Filippone and                  Penza of the University of Naples, Italy.  The objective of the                 project is to optimize gene transfer frequencies in a variety of                leguminous plants and to explore techniques for the production of               stably and homogeneously transformed plants from chimeric ones.                                                                                                 Leguminous plants are notoriously refractory to genetic                         engineering.  Failure to produce transgenic legumes is generally                attributed to the fact that fertile plants cannot be regenerated from           transformed callus cells growing in vitro.  The investigators have              developed a transformation procedure that does not require a tissue             culture step and allows recovery of large proportions of plantlets              chimeric for a transgene.  This procedure hinges on the                         cocultivation of isolated mature embryos with Agrobacterium                     tumefaciens followed by plantlet development on nonselective                    medium.  Specific staining indicated that large number of such                  plantlets contain a variety of tissues expressing the transgene.  The           two laboratories are essentially complementary, the Italian                     laboratory having a strong plant tissue culture and cytogenetic                 component, while the US laboratory is well versed in molecular                  and microbial techniques. Three graduate students are currently                 working on the project at Washington State University.  The results             of this collaboration will eventually improve the quality of pea,               lentil, and chickpea plants grown in the US; the technology will be             transferred to developing countries where cowpea and chickpea are               grown on a large scale (the Middle East and Africa), thanks to the              close links that exist between the Italian laboratory and IITA and              ICARDA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          //",
