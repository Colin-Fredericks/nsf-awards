 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron-dependent metabolic processes are central to nutrient                 uptake and energy transduction.  For open ocean phytoplankton,                  restricted iron availability may control the patterns and                       magnitude of primary productivity in surface waters.  This                      research will determine the iron use efficiencies for several                   ecologically important phytoplankton species.  The work will                    originally focus on a strain of Synechococcus.  Iron-limited                    continuous cultures will be used to obtain cells adapted to                     several iron-controlled growth rate.  Dr. Rueter will measure                   the total iron content and the distribution of the iron into                    several well characterized proteins that may control energy and                 nitrogen metabolism in these cells.  The work with Synechococcus                will lead to comparative studies with several other species,                    followed by direct competition experiments in iron-limited growth               conditions.  This work will provide an understanding of the role                of iron in phytoplankton metabolism in a parallel framework to                  that used by other investigators studying the efficiency of light               and nitrogen metabolism.  The efficient use of iron by individual               phytoplankton species is controlled by their strategies of                      regulation.  These strategies effect protein content and                        efficiency of growth processes and not only have competitive                    significance for those species but also help shape the community                structure of surface water ecosystems.",
