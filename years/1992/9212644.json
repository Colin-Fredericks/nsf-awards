 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to conduct the annual grantees conference of                the Division of Design and Manufacturing Systems.  By encouraging               interaction between the grantees of this Division, the Engineering              Research Centers Division and some of the grantees of the Computer              Information Science and Engineering Directorate, this conference                ensures that the individual researchers are informed about the                  ongoing activities of their colleagues.  An elimination of                      duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of                    cooperation may result from this activity.  An overall improvement              of efficiency of the research activity could be expected.  In                   addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time             to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective                 research community at the meeting, with feedback and input from the             National Science Foundation.  Finally, personal contacts with the               grantees and program officers in the Divisions should contribute                to clarifying many current problems in their work.                                   Principal investigators attending the conference usually gain              a one to two year lead on the information disseminated; this is the             usual time frame for materials presented at the conference to be                published in journals and other literature.",
