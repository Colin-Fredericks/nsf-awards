 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-institutional effort is proposed to obtain space-time              series of regional hydrological quantities reflecting climatic                  change scenarios.  The geographical areas to be investigated cover              central Arizona and the lower Platte river basin of Nebraska.  The              approach is based on an analysis of the occurrence, persistence and             transition probabilities of atmospheric circulation patterns.                   These patterns are defined daily as pressure surfaces using                     available and reliable data.  The proposed research consists of                 three phases.  In the first phase, a classification of circulation              patterns will be sought; each type of pattern is then related in                a conditional framework to local space-time precipitation, runoff,              temperature, and wind.  Temperature and wind are used to define                 regional drought indices.  Precipitation will be transformed into               runoff using relatively simple watershed models.  In the second                 phase of the research, available GCM outputs are used to define                 scenarios of possible daily time series of circulation                          precipitation, runoff, temperature, and regional droughts.                      Finally, the historical series of regional hydrologic events can                be compared to the various scenario predictions.  In the third                  phase of the research, the consequence of climatic change will be               analyzed by taking the example of the Great Salt Lake in Utah.",
