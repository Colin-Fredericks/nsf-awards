The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. Minami Yoda of Stanford to work with Dr. Heinrich                        Fiedler at the Technical University of Berlin.  Their research                  project involves development of techniques for the simultaneous                 acquisition of two-dimensional concentration and velocity fields for            application in turbulent water flows.  This technique will initially            be developed in a fundamental flow, the axisymmetric jet, to                    evaluate its accuracy and applicability.  They will then use their              technique to investigate the jet in counterflow, a new flow which is            of interest because it displays transition from convective to absolute          instability.  In both cases their approach will involve marking the             flows first with flueorescent dye to measure the two-dimensional                (passive scalar) concentration field, then with neutrally buoyant               particles to measure the velocity field, and finally with a                     combination of the two to acquire both fields at once.  The results             from this new technique will clarify the role of convective mixing              in turbulent free shear flows.                                                                                                                                  The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for twelve months.",
