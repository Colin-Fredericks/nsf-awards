 "awd_abstract_narration": "3 '-azido-2 ',3'-deoxyuridine (AZDU) has commercial potential as                a therapeutic agent in the treatment of AIDS.  At the present                   time it is produced via a complex expensive solution synthesis.                 The purpose of this Phase II SBIR research project is to                        investigate the scale-up potential of a solid phase synthesis                   procedure which has already been proven feasible in the                         laboratory under a Phase I grant.  The motivation includes                      substantial savings in production costs and an environmentally                  benign process with minimal waste generation.                                                                                                                   The process for the solid state synthesis progresses in four                    stages:                                                                              1. Activation of the functionalized polymer support                             2. Bonding of nucleoside to the resin                                           3. Conversion to polymer-bound AZDU                                             4. Product removal by hydrolysis with regeneration of the                          functionalized polymer                                                  Eventually production could be largely automated.  There is a                   potential that in lots of several kilograms, AZDU can be produced               by solid-phase technology for half of the cost required for the                 solution method.",
