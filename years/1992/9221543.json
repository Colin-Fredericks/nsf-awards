The                 connections to the two hospitals will be made via a 23 GHz                      microwave system.  The hub of the microwave network will be at the              University of Utah Health Sciences Center.  High-speed data                     communication services will significantly enhance the education and             research activities of faculty and students from the University of              Utah that work at these affiliated hospitals.                                        To provide high speed access (10 megavits per second) to the               NSFNET for researchers, clinical instructors and students at                    affiliated teaching hospitals in order to:                                                                                                                           1. Provide access to resources and services on the NSFNET for              faculty, staff and students at affiliated teaching hospitals.                        2. Extend access to integrated library system (ILS) services,              provide interinstitutional file and document delivery service.                       3. Distribute digitized images to medical student computer                 assisted instruction workstations located in the affiliated                     teaching hospitals.                                                                  4. Transmit digital modalities (CT, MRI and Digitized                      Radiographs) to support education of medical students and                       residents.",
