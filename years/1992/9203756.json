 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to develop methods from                   topology and apply them to representation theory of groups and                  automorphic forms.  The first part is a program to study perverse               sheaves from the micro-local point of view.  This includes an                   extension of the category of perverse sheaves to arbitrary                      homogeneous symplectic manifolds as well as the study of the mixed              and irregular versions of the theory.  The second part attempts                 applications to representation theory, in particular, geometric                 constructions of representations and micro-local study of                       characters of representations.  The third part is work on the                   geometric Langlands conjecture from various points of view.                          Groups are the natural algebraic structures to describe                    symmetry.  It is a classical method of understanding a group to                 realize (or represent) it as a collection of transformations of a               vector space.  The theory of representations has become highly                  evolved and even made itself indispensable in the study of quantum              mechanics, but it is by no means a completed theory and a closed                book.  The investigator is bringing to bear some of the latest                  topological and geometric methods in answering outstanding                      questions of representation theory.  Connections with other topics              in algebra and analysis are to be expected.",
