 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early transcription in the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Autographa             californica is directed by the host RNA polymerase II, while late               transcription depends on an a-amanitin-resistant, virus-induced                 polymerase.  The baculoviruses are increasingly important as                    expression vectors for producing large quantities of useful                     proteins.  An understanding of baculovirus gene expression will                 probably lead to better vectors.  In particular, an understanding               of the unique, a-amanitin-resistant, virus-induced RNA polymerase               would be especially valuable, since this is the enzyme that                     transcribes the cloned genes in baculovirus expression vectors.                 The immediate goal of this project is to map and characterize the               genes encoding this enzyme.  The specific aims are:  1. Isolating               viral mutants with lesions in the genes encoding the late-specific              viral RNA polymerase.  This will be accomplished in three steps:                a. Obtaining temperature sensitive (ts) viral mutants that are                  deficient in late gene expression, as evidenced by failure to form              non-occluded virions.  b. Screening these ts mutants for the                    inability to carry out a-amanitin-resistnt late transcription at                the non-permissive temperature in isolated nuclei.  c. Screening                the positive mutants from specific aim 1b for a ts virus-induced                polymerase by purifying the enzyme and showing that it is ts in                 vitro.  This would also demonstrate conclusively that this is                   indeed the polymerase responsible for late viral transcription.  2.             Mapping the mutant genes from specific aim 1c.  This will be done               by rescue of the wild-type phenotype with cloned fragments of the               viral genome.  3. Sequencing the mutant genes and their wild-type               counterparts to locate open reading frames and the lesions                      responsible for the ts phenotype.  In the unlikely event that we                cannot find mutants in the genes for the virus-induced RNA                      polymerase itself, the ts mutants we do isolate should be in the                genes for late-specific transcription factors.  These are also of               great interest, and will be mapped and sequenced.",
