 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program provides support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of                 the Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, on the                        reactivity of model complexes for dehydrosulfurization (HDS)                    catalysts.  Curtis will synthesize small cluster molecules                      consisting of two or three atoms of molybdenum, one to three                    atoms of a second metal, such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and                   two to four atoms of sulfur.  Their structural features will be                 examined and compared to their behavior in oxidation-reduction                  reactions.  Of particular interest are reactions involving                      abstraction of sulfur from organic molecules, particularly                      allyl sulfides.  Another reaction of interest involves olefins                  and hydrogen, since hydrogen is known to be involved in the                     desulfurization sequence.  Electrochemical studies, synthesis                   of organic molecules by desulfurization, and surface                            characterization of clusters when supported on alumina will                     also be included.                                                               %%%                                                                             Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is an commercial process that is                     promoted by catalysts prepared from molybdenum, cobalt, and                     sulfur.  It is used to remove sulfur from organic materials and                 is therefore important to enhancing air quality in industrial                   areas.  In this project, compounds which are models of the                      industrial catalyst will be prepared in an effort to understand                 the reactions which occur and perhaps improve the effectivess                   of the catalyst.",
