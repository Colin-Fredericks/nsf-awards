 "awd_abstract_narration": "The four senior investigators coordinate the work of a larger                   group, currently nineteen, representing at least a dozen                        colleges and universities.  During the first year of the                        project (1991-92), these nineteen met at a workshop at Colgate                  to present modules for teaching parallel computing concepts in                  various courses in the undergraduate computer science                           curriculum.  These modules are being revised and edited, and                    will be distributed for testing in courses in the winter and                    spring of 1992.  This award will continue this project from                     1992 to 1994.  Early in the summer of 1992, a second workshop                   to discuss teaching experiences and work on revising modules                    will be held.  The senior investigators will complete revision                  and editing of the modules based on the testing experiences.                    At the same time, plans for an appropriate channel for                          distribution will be formulated.  During 1992-93 and in the                     summer of 1993, the senior investigators will complete the                      extension of modules to cover different languages and hardware,                 and fill in gaps of coverage revealed by teaching experiences.                  The project will be completed with the publication of the                       modules in 1994.",
