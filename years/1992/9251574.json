 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the development of an undergraduate                         laboratory in fluid mechanics to support the Mechanical                         Engineering Program.  The grant provides the financial                          resources in order to purchase the following equipment:  (1)                    wind tunnels with manometer packages, probe packages and                        accessories to investigate Bernoulli's equation, and laminar                    and turbulent boundary layers; (2) NACA0020 airfoil sections                    with nineteen pressure taps to investigate the stalling angle                   of airfoils;  (3) hydraulic benches and accessories to be used                  to analyze venturi meters, flows through several different                      orifices, the impact of water jets; (4) piping systems with                     several different pipes and valves to calculate the energy                      losses present in such systems; (5) Reynolds number apparatuses                 to visualize laminar, transition, and turbulent flows; and (6)                  open water channels with accessories to investigate the                         hydraulic jump, flows over straight and vee notch weirs, and                    visualize flows around simple geometrical objects.  The                         laboratory will be an integral part of the MECE 3315 Fluid                      Mechanics course which is required for all mechanical                           engineering majors.  The laboratory illustrates the concepts                    covered in class.  Its main emphasis and effort is placed on                    gaining information from the experiments, experiencing the                      trials and tribulations of experimentation and not simply                       demonstrating physical principles.",
