 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Enhanced Science Learning (PESL) offers learning                        partners opportunities to engage in authentic scientific                        inquiry through apprenticeship.  Such inquiry is often                          enabled by dynamic interactions among learning partners in                      physical proximity.  Yet scientific and business practice                       using Internet and broadband services recognizes that not                       all partners necessary to an interaction can be co-located.                     Our vision uses new technologies to extend the collaborative                    \"reach\" of PESL to include diverse expertise among remote                       learners, teachers, and scientists.                                                                                                                             This work, in atmospheric sciences, extends collaborative                       media beyond asynchronous text-only email to shared                             workspaces and two-way audio/video connections that allow                       for collaborative visualization of science phenomena, data,                     models - What You See Is What I See (WYSIWIS).  Tools for                       local- and wide-area networked learning environments will                       enable highly interactive, media-rich communications among                      learning partners.  Research on these learning architectures                    will provide pedagogy and social protocols for                                  authenticating the science learning experience in classrooms                    and other spaces.  Greater motivation to learn and enhanced                     science learning in terms of more valid, performance                            assessments should result from students' participations.                        The next decade brings widespread, networked multi-media                        interpersonal computing.  This project will provide a                           blueprint to inform the effective use of interpersonal                          collaborative media for science education.",
