 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves population and behavioral studies of the                 superb fairy-wren, a species of bird that lives in Australia.  This             work will contribute to our knowledge about the biology of this                 species and the avifauna of Australia generally.  More important,               it will add to our understanding of evolutionary processes                      affecting reproductive biology and social behavior of nonhuman                  species.                                                                                                                                                        Superb fairy-wrens are interesting because they live in large                   social groups, the offspring from one generation remain in the                  territory and help the parents raise young in successive breeding               attempts, and social mates are often related to each other.  This               great potential for inbreeding among closely related individuals                appears to have been solved by fairy-wrens in what may be a unique              manner:  females in each group mate promiscuously with males from               other groups.  This research is attempting to verify and study the              mechanisms by which individual fairy-wrens avoid inbreeding and the             relationship between the species' mating system and the patterns of             morphology and plumage coloration.  As the research uses molecular              techniques in determining the patterns of mating, the work will                 also add to our knowledge of genetic variation within and among                 families in this species, and the use of DNA fingerprinting as a                means of identifying sires of offspring.",
