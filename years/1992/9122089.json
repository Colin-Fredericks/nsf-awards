 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research would study the implications of learning-by-doing in              production for theoretical models of industrial organization.  The              most common technological specification of learning-by-doing is the             learning curve hypothesis that a firm's unit cost declines with                 cumulative output.  A first research task is to study the strategic             implications of the learning curve in a dynamic model of duopoly.               The methodology is to characterize a symmetric Markov perfect                   equilibrium and evaluate its properties.  A second task is to                   derive implications for antitrust, trade, and patent policies.  A               third task is to reconsider the foundations of the learning curve               hypothesis, studying industrial organization implications of other,             more general, learning-by-doing technologies.  A final task is to               extend these models to investigate the equilibrium timing of                    production and deliveries when buyers as well as firms behave                   strategically.  This research departs from previous industrial                  organization research in several respects: (1) the theoretical                  model is new; (2) the analytical methods are different; and (3) new             questions are raised.  A longer term goal is to lay foundations for             empirical work.",
