 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintaining genetic diversity within an endangered species                 is an important goal of conservation biology.  However, the                     threat of disease to endangered plants has been neglected in past                                                                                               studies.  Disease may cause plant numbers to decline and\\or the                 disease may reduce the genetic diversity within a population.  An                                                                                               example is a white rust disease of the Menzies' wallflower,                     Erysimum menziesii, an endangered plant restricted to vanishing                 native dune communities along the northern California coast.                    Some populations of the plant suffer from the disease and,                      although the wallflower has been the object of extensive                        research, the destructive effect of the disease has not been                    investigated.  Both ecological and genetic studies are required.                                                                                                This research will closely examine the relationship between the                 wallflower and its disease to assess if disease has caused the                  plant to become endangered or is keeping the plant from                         recovering.  In addition, the genetic diversity within both the                 plant and pathogen populations will be measured for three years                 and this will provide an indication if diversity is being                       maintained during conservation or if there is any change in the                 genetic structure.                                                              Many aspects of this research are unique.  It is a collaborative                                                                                                effort between The California Nature Conservancy, a conservation                                                                                                management organization, and Michigan State University, a                       traditional basic research institution.  This partnership will                  provide needed cooperative effort between basic science and                     applied conservation.  By combining genetic studies with                        population monitoring, management options specifically for                      Menzies'wallflower will be addressed.  In addition, this approach                                                                                               will introduce a generalized strategy to assess the impact of                   disease on other endangered plants.  The results will provide the                                                                                               basis for future predictive mathematical models which can be used                                                                                               to evaluate how specific conservation activities would affect                   recovery.  From this, conservationists will be able to choose                   between management options.  Included with these applied aspects                                                                                                is the basic study of plant disease in natural populations.  This                                                                                               project will expand the discipline by introducing a new type of                 model system, one with different attributes than those currently                                                                                                under study.",
