 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to determine how reliably                   mtDNA can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of                    higher primates (monkeys, apes and humans).  The use of mtDNA to                study higher primate evolution rests on three critical                          assumptions: (1) that we know the rate at which the mtDNA of two                species diverge from one another; (2) that this rate is constant                over time and across different groups of species; and (3) that                  within a species, individuals have mtDNA that is more or less the               same.  The PI has begun to test these assumptions on a number of                Asian macaque monkey species and has found (1) large mtDNA                      differences between members of the same species, (2) rates of                   mtDNA divergence that vastly exceed the accepted rate of change,                and (3) divergence rates that vary among populations or species.                These findings suggest serious problems with the use of mtDNA to                reconstruct evolutionary relationships and date evolutionary                    events.                                                                                                                                                         Macaque monkey females never leave the group they are born in;                  the results may be related to this sedentary behavior.                          Therefore, the extent to which the problems already identified                  will be found in apes and humans is unclear.  The PI proposes to                investigate this by extending research to other macaque species                 and by performing similar sets of tests on the Asian leaf                       monkeys, whose females do not necessarily stay in their original                group.  This research will provide the first comprehensive                      assessment of the dynamics of mtDNA evolution in the higher                     primates.  Such information will ultimately lead to a better                    understanding of the evolutionary history of humans and their                   closest relatives.",
