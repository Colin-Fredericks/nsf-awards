 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop will focus directly on research topics of                 systems, models and feedback with applications to underwater                    robots.  Special emphasis will be placed on the use of recent                   advances in nonlinear and intelligent control theory in analysis,               synthesis, operation and control of underwater robots.  The use                 of nonlinear and intelligent control theory in flight control,                  satellite control, and robot control in both the United States                  and Italy was very successful in the last decade; this workshop                 will certainly generate important results in the modeling,                      control and operation of underwater robots.                                                                                                                     Because underwater robots and its control in both the United                    States and Italy is continuing to grow in importance.  This                     workshop will focus on the most timely and current subject of                   research.  The participants from both countries consist of                      leading researchers and they have already developed fruitful                    interactions through previous contacts.  Further collaboration                  would lead to deeper understanding of the important problems in                 the area.  So this workshop should benefit both countries and                   lead to building valuable international connections and achieving               international cross-fertilization of ideas.  It certainly will                  lead to the advancement of modeling, control, and operation of                  underwater robots.  In fact, we have received requests for                      participation in the workshop by well-known researchers from                    Europe and Japan.",
