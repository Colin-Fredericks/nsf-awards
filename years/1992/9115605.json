 "awd_abstract_narration": "The >20 um size fraction of marine phytoplankton sinks faster                   than smaller components and is an important size fraction to                    consider in global flux out of the euphotic zone through the                    oceanic water column to the sediments.  In order to understand                  the abundance and biomass of the >20 um phytoplankton in the                    equatorial Pacific, multiple opening and closing net collections                as well as water bottle samples will be studied through this                    program from the seasonal JGOFS EQPAC cruises. The priority will                be to 2 seasonal time-series cruises within 20 north and south of               the equator in the area known to have the greatest flux of                      material to the sediments. The netplankton will be  concentrated                from different strata by a multiple opening and closing new                     system deployed at depths chosen to complement a similar                        zooplankton sampling scheme as well as to concentrate                           phytoplankton from the upper surface layers and just below the                  euphotic zone in a depth region identified as very active                       biogeochemically.  The seasonal survey cruises will allow                       meridional interpretations of the larger phytoplankton from water               bottle samples and vertical net hauls.  The larger diatoms and                  dinoflagellates are excellent indicators of the different water                 masses encountered, and the life histories and vertical zonation                of the more heavily silicified diatom species found in equatorial               water will be used to test a possible relationship between degree               of silicification and growth-limiting conditions seen in higher                 latitude waters.",
