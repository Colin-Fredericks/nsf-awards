 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an expert system data acquisition and                     analysis program for teaching one-dimensional consolidation                     testing and triaxial shear testing in the undergraduate soil                    mechanics laboratory.  These tests are used to predict the                      amount of settlement that foundations will undergo and the                      factor of safety against foundation collapse.  Expert systems                   are powerful tools with many engineering applications.  The                     programs allow students to answer their own questions by using                  a mouse and clicking on the screen area hot spots to display                    and analyze a problem.  One of the objectives of the project is                 give undergraduates early exposure to this tool so that they                    may develop their own applications once they are part of the                    workforce.  This project connects data acquisition and computer                 equipment to existing laboratory equipment.  The equipment                      enables digital loads and displacements to be recorded and                      analyzed using the expert systems program.  The expert systems                  program uses color screens that depict sketches and equations                   relevant to the topics of consolidation and triaxial shear to                   assist students in learning these specific topics.",
