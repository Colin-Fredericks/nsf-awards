 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understnd the fundamental features              of ion induced surface reactions in focused ion beam                            microfabrication, and of the materials and surfaces that are                    produced by the resulting deposition or etching.  This will be                  accomplished by bringing to bear expertise from chemical                        engineering, materials science, and microfabrication technology.                In the case of the deposition, understanding of the basic process               is expected to point to ways of eliminating unwanted carbon                     impurities, for example, by the addition of a second, appropriately             reactive, precursor gas or an atomic beam.  Eliminating or                      significantly reducing the impurities in the deposited material                 would be a major breakthrough.  The reduced resistivity and                     increased density would  immediately make focused ion beam device               and circuit repair processes more effective and open the door to                new applications of maskless, resistless, patterned conductor                   deposition by projection ion techniques and to in situ processing.              %%%                                                                                     Ion induced deposition and ion assisted etching are new                 processes for material addition and removal.  Since ion beams can               be focused to extremely small dimensions (0.05 microns and below),              this permits material manipulation with unprecedented resolution                and flexibility and has spawned commercial applications in micro-               repair of integrated circuits and in microsectioning for fault                  diagnosis.  By developing a better understanding of the mechanisms              of these new processes, and by extending them to new materials, the             proposed research work aims to broaden the applications to the                  deposition of the original wiring of future ultrafast integrated                circuits.",
