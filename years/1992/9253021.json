 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary goal of the proposed research is to investigate an                    environment that historically has been subject to contamination by              heavy metals, and to examine the putative toxicological effects of              these heavy metals (particularly arsenic and lead) on samples of the            biota characteristic of the heavily urbanized and industrialized El             Paso/Cd. Juarez region in the northern Chihuahuan Desert.  Using                both the urbanized region and a study area remote from the urban                area as a control habitat, studies, using multidisciplinary, integrated         approach will be undertaken to (1) assess the extent of heavy metal             contamination in representative species and the distribution of the             contaminants through the food web, (2) analyze the capacity of                  microbes to metabolize the heavy metal contaminants and adjust for              them at the molecular genetic level and (3) investigate the putative            mechanisms of toxicity at the cellular level through experiments,               initially, on plant growth, mutagenic load and gametogenesis in                 microfauna.                                                                                                                                                     A second goal of the proposed research is to provide a stimulating              research/mentoring environment that will promote the entry of                   underrepresented minorities and women into biological sciences,                 particularly the rapidly to evolving field of environmental toxicology.         Students will have the opportunity to become involved in innovative             research from the ground up, by sharing in the responsibility of                designing experimental protocols, collecting and analyzing the data.            Students involved in the program will be encouraged to present the              fruits of their research at local and national meetings, providing them         with the opportunity to network with others in the field.",
