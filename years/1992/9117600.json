 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of proteins involved in photosynthesis point to an                      important pathway of fermentation which permits survival of                     cyanobacteria and algae under dark, anaerobic conditions.  Studies              of the soluble, low potential cytochrome c which is abundant in                 some cyanobacteria and algae suggest that this cytochrome links                 ferredoxin to hydrogenase in supporting the fermentation of                     carbohydrate reserves.  The hypothesis of cytochrome function to                be tested is based on data from enzymology and cell physiology.                 It must be confirmed by the techniques of gene deletion.  Studies               of the chemistry of catalyst interaction and of regulation of                   expression of the genes involved are proposed.  Different sets of               catalysts of this pathway were present in different compartments                of the cell.  The structure and function of these proteins will be              studied.                                                                                                                                                        There is evidence that a carotenoid protein may function to protect             cyanobacteria from photodestruction in bright light.  Experiments               are proposed to extend and clarify this hypothesis.                                                                                                             Cytochrome c6 may be a catalyst of both photosynthetic and                      respiratory electron transport.  We have found three isoforms of                this catalyst.  The PI will study the chemical basis for these                  forms and look for roles in distinct catalytic functions or in                  targeting to different compartments of the cell.",
