This laboratory                 course is unusual in that it is not concerned with a series of                  rigid experiments that is repeated each semester but rather                     deals with experiments periodically solicited from local and                    national industries.  Participating industries contribute                       state-of-the-art experimental problems plus the equipment to be                 investigated (usually part of their product line), and, in                      return, they receive a copy of the completed student laboratory                 report. The project will allow the expansion of this effective                  and successful course into the complex field of high speed                      dynamic measurements.  This enhanced laboratory experience will                 help to educate new engineers with up-to-date knowledge and                     competence with high-speed measurement methods.",
