 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this application Dr. Davidson proposes to capitalize on recent               discoveries made in our lab in respect to the molecular basis of                bindin-receptor interaction.  The species specificity of                        fertilization in certain sympatic sea urchin species depends on                 molecular recognition of the acrosomal bindin protein by egg                    receptor.  Previously he has cloned bindin mRNAs and compared the               bindin protein sequences from several species of sea urchin, and                we have recently identified specific short regions of the protein               that are apparently engaged in contact with the receptor, and that              are at least in part responsible for the species specificity of the             interaction.  Here he proposes a series of new experiments: i, we               will generate transgenic S. purpuratus expressing S. franciscanus               bindin to determine whether presentation of the bindin sequence per             se will promote interspecific fertilization; ii, he will also test              in vivo the functional significance of alterations in specific                  regions of bindin sequence; iii, he will determine the polymorphism             of the bindin/receptor interaction in S.franciscanus in order to                understand how speciation might have come about; iv, he will carry              out studies on the interaction of recombinant mutant bindin                     fragments with the receptor fragment recently described by Foltz                and Lennarz; v, he will investigate incorporation of exogenous                  bindin (and other) genes in growing spermatocytes in culture, and               determine whether transgenic spermatocytes can mature into                      functional sperm in culture.",
