 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past two decades there has been considerable                    progress in the understanding of the nature of matter through the               rigorous mathematical analysis of models which describe different               states of matter.  The more notable developments include (1) a                  thorough analysis of Thomas-Fermi and related semi-classical                    models for atomic and molecular systems, (2) analysis of the                    stability of matter, (3) verification of the correct asymptotes                 of the ground state of energy of atoms up to certain orders, (4)                proof of the finiteness of the maximum excess charge of atomic                  and molecular systems, estimates on the maximum excess charge,                  and proofs of asymptotic neutrality, (5) proofs of the existence                of the thermodynamic limit for Coulomb systems, (6) analysis of                 models in quantum and statistical mechanics, (7) analysis of such               quantum phenomena as the quantum Hall effect and the formation of               Cooper pairs, and (8) proof of the existence of the hydrodynamic                limit of Boltzmann's equation for interacting particle systems.                      This project will support a block travel grant to the                      Conference on the State of Matter to be held in Copenhagen,                     Denmark from July 30 to August 1, 1992.  The conference will                    provide an opportunity for newer mathematicians and scientists to               learn about developments at the leading edge of this branch of                  mathematical physics.",
