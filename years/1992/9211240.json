 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution grant to conduct                theoretical research concerning the static and dynamic scaling                  properties of a variety of surfaces which exhibit entropic                      roughening due to thermal fluctuations, but in the presence of                  quenched disorder (in the form of randomly distributed pinning                  impurities) can lead to wandering that is enhanced many-fold.                   There are a number of fundamental theoretical issues of great                   practical importance which arise from the delicate interplay                    between thermal and disorder-induced roughening.  This follows                  naturally from the fact that most experimental systems are to some              degree forms of ill-condensed matter; the smallest modicum of                   randomness having potentially drastic effects upon not merely the               critical properties, but the entire global structure of the phase               diagram.  Among the various manifolds to be discussed are                       individual vortex lines in ceramic superconductors, directed                    polymers in random media, and domain walls in impurity-stricken                 magnets.  A mapping via Burgers equation permits us to connect the              directed polymer problem to stochastic growth models such as                    ballistic deposition and Eden clusters.  Also considered are                    interfacial delocalization due to quenched disorder and impurity                controlled distortions of Abrikosov flux line lattices.                         %%%                                                                             Analytical and computational research will be conducted at Barnard              College on the effects of disorder on the general properties of                 surfaces and their manifestations in particular physical systems                such as polymers, superconductors and magnets.  The work will                   utilize undergraduates.",
