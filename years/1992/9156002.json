Class activities involve the                      active engagement of students in \"thought experiments\" and                      hands-on exercises in lab and field through the emphasis on the                 collection, consideration and use of scientific evidence and                    principles  in historical, political, economic, and cultural                    contexts.  The products of class assignments  require clear                     articulation of the problem and proposed solutions via both the                 written and spoken word.  Collaborative learning is featured.                   The goals of this approach are to a) show the connections of                    Science to our social institutions, b) promote critical                         thinking and communication skills, and c) recruit and mentor                    science students, while making science education more                           accessible to all students.",
