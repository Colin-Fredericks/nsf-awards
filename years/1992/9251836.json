 "awd_abstract_narration": "For several years, the undergraduate software engineering                       course at Carnegie Mellon University has revolved around the                    specification, design and prototyping of an ambitious real                      system such as an E-mail to FAX interface and an interactive                    city directory system including building directories, maps and                  bus routing information.  The process of organizing an entire                   class of some thirty students toward a single technical goal is                 itself one of the object lessons of the course.  This ILI                       funding will assist in moving this course to a new level of                     excitement, by providing a notebook computer with a wireless                    network interface to be used by each student.  Students will                    use the computers to  organize their group project and work                     collaboratively on its implementation.  The students will also                  implement their system on the network, opening the door to a                    limitless set of projects prototyping collaborative and                         personal productivity tools.                                                                                                                                    Three main benefits are expected from this project.  First, the                 students in the course will have a chance to work with                          technologies and applications that are at the cutting edge, but                 will soon be widespread.  Second, for that very reason,                         software companies may be expected to take a keen interest in                   these projects, which will in effect be doing rapid prototyping                 of new kinds of products, and will be eager to interact with                    the students as clients and technical advisors for the course.                  Third, the experiences will help to pave the way for other                      institutions to start similar programs, introducing their                       students to emerging consumer information technology, as                        hardware costs drop and wireless portable systems become                        ubiquitous.",
