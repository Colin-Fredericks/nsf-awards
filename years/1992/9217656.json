The goal of the research is to establish the                                    geochronologic, geochemical, and petrologic                                     framework from which important details bearing                                  on the tectonic and magmatic evolution of the                                   transition zone between the Main Ethiopian Rift                                 (MER) and Afar can be elucidated.  The                                          elemental and Sr isotope geochemistry will be                                   performed in-house by T. Chernet; the Nd and Pb                                 isotope work will be done by the PI, using the                                  facilities of the Department of Terrestrial                                     Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington.                                                                                                                  This type of geochemical and geochronologic                                     study is of great interest to the cooperating                                   institution, the Ethiopian Institute of                                         Geological Surveys, particularly from the                                       standpoints of gaining a clearer understanding                                  of the duration and thermal evolution of major                                  silicic volcanic centers and of gaining                                         valuable age and chemical information to aid in                                 ongoing geologic mapping projects.  Thus, the                                   information derived will assist their ongoing                                   efforts to harness the geothermal potential                                     associated with many of northern MER and Afar                                   silicic complexes.  It is envisioned that                                       collaboration between the PI and the                                            cooperating institution in Ethiopia will                                        continue well beyond this particular research                                   effort.  This project is relevant to the                                        objectives of the Science in Developing                                         Countries (SDC) Program with regard to                                          strengthening scientific and engineering                                        infrastructure in developing countries and                                      increasing cooperation between U.S. scientists                                  and engineers and their counterparts in                                         developing countries.",
