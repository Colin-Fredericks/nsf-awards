 "awd_abstract_narration": "Free living amoebae of the genus Naegleria were found to contain             a filterable agent (NACM, Naegleria amoeba cytopathogenic material)             that could destroy a variety of vertebrate cells in culture in a                highly distinctive manner.  After a delay of 4-6 days, a new                    product, detected by monoclonal antibodies made to NACM, developed              in the cytoplasm of the treated cells at a time shortly preceding               the rapid and complete disintegration of the entire culture. Active             products from such cells could be passaged on new cultures. The                 objective of this investigation is to identify by amino acid                    sequence the biologically active NACM and to use this identity to               determine the causal relationship between it and the new cell                   products.  The isolation methods include hydrophobic interaction,               gel permeation, and affinity chromatography, followed by                        preparative and analytical electrophoresis.  The identification                 methods include bioassay, determination of amino acid sequence,                 peptide synthesis and antibody production and use in immunoassays,              immunochemical identification, quantitation, and analysis.                      %%%                                                                             Essentially, NACM is a protein which, in some as yet unknown                    fashion, triggers in cultured vertebrate cells both the production              of more of itself (or a close homolog) and the specific death of                the cell.  Elucidation of the mechanism underlying the NACM                     phenomenon could have broad implications for biology.",
