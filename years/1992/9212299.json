This purchase                                            is part of a series of measures the                                             University has undertaken which will                                            establish a research program in the                                             field of lasers and nonlinear optics                                            at the Fairbanks campus.  The                                                   University has demonstrated a strong                                            financial commitment to the new                                                 program through the hiring of new                                               research faculty, the construction                                              of a new science facility, and the                                              purchase of laboratory equipment.                                                                                                                               This laser system is the last major                                             purchase necessary for the new                                                  nonlinear optics facility at UAF.                                               The facility will be housed in the                                              new Natural Sciences building upon                                              its completion in spring 1993.                                                  Optical tables, electronic                                                      instrumentation and a host of optics                                            hardware are already in place.                                                  Present inventory includes two                                                  Argon-ion lasers, a flashlamp-pumped                                            dye laser, a nitrogen laser, and a                                              nitrogen-pumped dye laser.  The                                                 Nd:YAG laser will provide a much-                                               needed source in the multi-megawatt                                             range that is absolutely essential                                              if we are to implement a research                                               and instruction program in nonlinear                                            optics.                                                                                                                                                         The Nd:YAG laser system will be used                                            as a coherent light source for a                                                number of different projects.  These                                            include development of new materials                                            and techniques for tunable optical                                              parametric oscillators and harmonic                                             generation, and optical combustion                                              diagnostics.  In addition, the                                                  system will contribute to ongoing                                               projects in thin film physics and                                               the study of airborne pollutants in                                             the Arctic.",
