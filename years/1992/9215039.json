The purpose of this award is to                                         support a three-person committee to oversee                                     the design of this simulator.                                                                                                                                   The committee members consist of a                                              geotechnical engineer having expertise in the                                   design, installation and operation of an                                        earthquake simulator having the same                                            operational principle as the one being                                          designed; a structural engineer with expertise                                  in the dynamics of structures, especially with                                  respect to statistical aspects of the analysis and                              performance; and a mechanical engineer                                          experienced in the design and analysis of                                       rotating devices, including motors and drive                                    systems.  The oversight involves technical                                      studies and selected experiments, some of                                       which are performed by the committee, and                                       some by the University of California at Davis.
