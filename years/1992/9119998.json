 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will deal with spectroscopic and kinetic                     evaluation of the generation of arylnitrenium ions. Although                    the initial phase of the project will involve the photolysis of                 anthranilium salts, it is expected that several new                             photochemical methods for the general production of                             arylnitrenium ions will eventually emerge. The study will                       center on the use of nanosecond laser flash photolysis, low                     temperature ESR spectroscopy, and molecular orbital                             calculations to provide unequivocal identification of                           arylnitrenium ions. A highlight of the work will be to define                   the spin-multiplicity of the nitrenium ions generated and the                   products formed from each spin state. The question of the                       existence of a singlet-triplet equilibrium will be answered and                 the consequences for final product distribution will be                         delineated. The role of arylnitrenium ions in DNA damaging                      reactions will also be investigated by trapping of                              arylnitrenium ions with guanine to simulate carcinogenetic                      reactivity.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This new grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                   work of Professor Daniel A. Falvey at the University of                         Maryland. The investigation will seek to analyze the reactivity                 of very short lived molecules called nitrenium ions.                            Nitrenium ions, which possess a nitrogen with a positive                        charge, have received little attention and yet represent a                      potential class of reactive species with widespread utility in                  chemical processes induced by light. By using an instrument                     designed to take snap-shot ultraviolet absorption \"pictures\" of                 transient chemical species which live a few billionths of a                     second, it will be possible to confirm the existence of                         arylnitrenium ions which have been implicated as the primary                    entities involved in the DNA damaging process of arylamines.",
