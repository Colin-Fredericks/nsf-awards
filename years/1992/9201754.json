 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of the Virgin Islands, a historically black                      university, requests support from NSF for connection of its                     campus network to NSFNET.  The connection would be made from UVI                to the organization supporting connectivity to the University of                Puerto Rico and from there to SURAnet, the midlevel network                     located in this region that will provide operations and network                 information services.  The award will support a 56 thousand bits                per second connection from the University of the Virgin Islands                 to the University of Puerto Rico.                                                                                                                               The University will benefit from the greater functionality and                  network speed available through this connection to be able to                   access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along                 with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                                                                                                       Students, instructors, and faculty researchers will benefit from                the link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the school to                  explore innovative educational resources.***",
