 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award is to support                      research whose objective is to understand how individuals                       formulate and make decisions about insurance as a form of                       financial protection against low probability but high consequence               events.                                                                                                                                                         Adults will be interviewed regarding three different insurance                  decisions.  The study is designed as a conceptual replication of                the well-known Kunreuther (1978) study of how people make hazard                (flood and earthquake) insurance decisions.  This involves                      testing models based upon Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) and                 information diffusion theories, that latter of which has been                   hypothesized to be descriptively more accurate.  The research                   objectives are to (1) test whether the information diffusion                    theory generalizes to other types of insurance, (2) determine                   whether SEU predicts better when improved response elicitation                  methods are used, and (3) determine whether people use consistent               strategies when considering different kinds of insurance.  In                   addition, the project will examine whether consumers' intuitive                 definitions of insurance (and its purposes), beliefs about the                  insurance system, and budget constraints predict consumers'                     decisions.",
