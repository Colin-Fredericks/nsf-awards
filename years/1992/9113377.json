The nature of this                          relationship appears to be different from cases of tonal                        dependence on consonants attested in other parts of the world.                  Furthermore, the connection between the initial consonant and the               tone pattern of a word is especially unclear in Musey because the               phonetic nature of many of the contrasting consonants is itself                 obscure.  This dissertation project will analyze the tone system                and investigate the relationships between consonant type                        fundamental frequency, and tone in Musey.  Fieldwork will be                    conducted in Northern Cameroon. The student will examine tone in                Musey and then construct and record the materials for a series of               acoustic, aerodynamic, and perceptual experiments.  The data                    collected will be analyzed in the field using portable phonetic                 instrumentation; supplementary analyses will be conducted at the                UCLA Phonetic Laboratory as well.  This study will provide a                    comprehensive analysis of the Musey tone system, with particular                attention given to consonantal effects on tone.  The phonetic                   experiments will determine the phonetic characteristics of an                   obscure consonantal contrast and examine the phonetic effects of                these consonants on fundamental frequency.  The phonetic analyses               will provide new data leading to reconsideration of the                         interdependence between phonetic and phonological effects of                    consonants on fundamental frequency and tone and the implications               for a theory of the synchronic and diachronic relationships                     between consonants and tone.",
