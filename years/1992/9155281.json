Located in science centers. museums and                      schools around the country. Learning Centers house equipment and                educational programming for hands-on training during a simulated                mission.  Scenarios use mathematics, science and problem-solving                skills to provide participants with simulated experiences of                    working in a space laboratory and a \"Mission control\"                           laboratory.                                                                                                                                                     Challenger Center requests assistance and partnership from NSF                  to develop, field test, implement and evaluate a new scenario on                the environment, \"Mission to Planet Earth\" scenario.  This                      project will involve collaboration of expert scientists,                        educators, Challenger staff, and science museum professionals.                  Annually more than 180,000 students and between 10,000 and                      15,000 adults will participate in the scenario at Learning                      Centers, using space as a format for learning about                             environmental issues.  Challenger is working on the preliminary                 planning stage between June and December 1991.  Two years of                    funding are requested from NSF beginning in January 1992.",
