 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science of global climate change and its impacts is dominated               by uncertainty.  Public policy decisions require near term                      scientific judgments, since the scientific facts will not be                    known for years.  This study conducts research on the elicitation               of expert judgment in the context of the global ecological                      impacts of climate change.  The study generalizes elicitation                   methods by asking experts to structure the issues, propose a                    model, and the give judgments about the important parameters of                 their model.  This approach gives the experts more latitude to                  express their views compared to prior work in expert judgment.  A               two-stage elicitation process is used to elicit the expert's                    views about: (1) the structure, the metric(s), and the value of                 key uncertain coefficients that should be used in framing the                   problem; (2) the reliability of key findings in their field of                  expertise and in other fields upon which their work depends                     (including the reliability of consensus reports); (3) their                     sensitivity to and ability to identify the potential sources of                 surprise; and (4) the amount of reduction in uncertainty (in                    their field of expertise and in other climate change related                    issues) that could be achieved with various amounts of research                 investment.  These elicitations will help us to define the                      character of uncertainties dominating climate change issues                     better, shed light on how the reliability of knowledge and                      research is gauged within the scientific community, and provide                 guidance on research allocations.",
