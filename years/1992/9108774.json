 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Wyoming will enhance the research                      competitiveness of over 30 investigators working in two                         research clusters:  (1) Ground Water Contamination: Detection,                  Prediction, Remediation; and (3) Basic Research in Fossil Energy                Science.  The clusters will form the core of a new Center for                   Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming.                 The Center will enhance Wyoming's human resources in S&E, its                   technological and economic development, and its fundamental                     science.  In addition,innovative programs for teachers and for                  all students, especially women and minorities, will enhance the                 development of Wyoming's young people.                                                                                                                          Because Wyoming has no major federal or industrial research                     facilities, the Wyoming EPSCoR improvement plan focuses                         primarily on the University of Wyoming (UW).  Interactions                      between UW, community colleges, public schools, and                             technology/economic development organizations are                               incorporated throughout the plan.  Primary objectives                           include:  (1) expansion of UW's capacity to conduct S&E                         research through reallocation of UW funds and positions and                     by enhanced state support; (2) an increased pool of S&E                         students through development of appealing interdisciplinary                     programs; (3) increased interactions between UW and the                         Western Research Institute through joint research; and (5)                      increased state awareness of the role of S&E research in                        Wyoming's economic development through enhanced interaction                     with established state boards and the executive and                             legislative branches of state government. Over the three-                       year award period the State of Wyoming will contribute $3.9                     million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.",
