 "awd_abstract_narration": "A member of the group of S-type lectins, variously known as                  CBP35, Mac-2, Laminin-Binding Protein, L-34, RL-29, etc., has been              shown to reside in the nucleus of mammalian cells.  This protein                was shown some years ago to be associated with a ribonucleoprotein              complex which was identified as hnRNP.  Pilot experiments will be               performed to address the possibility that the lectin is involved                in splicing of nuclear pre mRNA.                                                                                                                                The idea that a galactoside-binding lectin is involved in the                   splicing of pre mRNA is a highly speculative one, for which                     presently available evidence is thin.  If the proposed preliminary              experiments provide further support for the hypothesis, the results             would substantially alter current thinking in the areas of                      intracellular lectins and RNA processing.",
