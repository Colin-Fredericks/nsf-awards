 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant progress was made recently in defining the structure             of the highly polymorphic B-G antigens encoded within the major                 histocompatibility complex of the chicken.  It has been determined              that B-G antigens are a family of molecules, divergent members of               which are expressed on cells in several different tissues in                    addition to erythrocytes, including immune system cells.                        Determination of the sequences of some of the B-G family members                has revealed the structural basis of B-G polymorphism, including                the presence of hypervariable sequence diversity within an                      immunoglobulin v-like domain.  B-G cytoplasmic tails are made up                of heptad repeats of diverse sequence.  B-G antigens have been                  found on the epithelia in the gut, cells in the liver, thrombocytes             (highly phagocytic cells in birds), some lymphocytes, and cells                 within the stroma of the bursa and thumus.  The objective of this               project is to attempt to define the function (or functions) of the              B-G antigens in light of the newly recognized sites where B-G                   molecules are now known to be expressed.                                                                                                                        The B-G antigens have long been known as blood group antigens of                chickens.  Until recently, the B-G antigens were thought to be                  expressed exclusively on red blood cells.  They are now known to                be expressed in various cell types and tissues throughout the                   chick, at various stages of development.  Furthermore, they have                been shown through DNA sequencing work to have structural                       resemblance to immunoglobulin genes.  These new observations have               led to the hypothesis that the B-G antigens may play some role in               the chicken immune system.  The goal of this study is to explore                this hypothesis.  The results of this study have the potential to               shed new light on how the immune system of the chicken operates.",
