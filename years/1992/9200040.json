 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                     Experiences for Undergraduates Site at The Rocky Mountain                       Biological Laboratory.  Ten undergraduate students per year for                 three years, will be supported to participate in research focusing              on field biology studies.  The RMBL has a strong tradition of field             research and education, and has been providing undergraduate                    research opportunities for 64 years.  Each student will attend the              RMBL for 10 weeks.  Guidance will be provided in scientific design,             project selection and initiation, and project completion.  A ratio              of one supervising research mentor for each student will be                     maintained.  Students will be encouraged to participate in the many             research opportunities available at the RMBL, such as formal and                informal seminars, interactions with visiting scientists, and                   exposure to all levels of a field biology community.  The                       intellectual progress of each student will be monitored carefully               by the Program Coordinator and by each research mentor, as the                  summer proceeds and students move from relative dependence to                   relative independence in their research pursuits.  The RMBL is                  particularly proud of its success in educating women interested in              field biology, and in attracting senior female scientists.  Plans               for increasing minority student participation are included in this              award.",
