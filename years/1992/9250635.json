 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to revise and improve the                           curriculum of the sophomore, junior and senior year physics                     laboratory courses through the introduction of the                              microcomputer.  The program will address the need perceived by                  the UMass/Boston Physics Department to provide training to                      students in the use of a computer in making physical                            measurements, an essential skill to be mastered by physicists                   in today's technological society.  By integrating computers                     into the laboratory environment students will receive a hands-                  on, intuitive feel for the computer as a powerful tool                          available to supplement their experimental work.  The                           University of Massachusetts at Boston was established with a                    mission to serve the urban areas of Boston.  Our student body                   has a high percentage of disadvantaged students who do not have                 access to computers outside the university setting.                             Implementation of this program will provide them with the                       laboratory experience in computer use which is required for                     them to compete successfully upon graduation.",
