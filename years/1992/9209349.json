 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last few decades linear algebra has played a                    fundamental role in advances being made in the area of signals,                 systems and control.  The most profound impact has been in the                  computational and implementational aspects, where numerical linear              algebraic algorithms have strongly influenced the ways in which                 problems are being solved.  The advent of special computing                     architectures such as vector processors and distributed processor               arrays has also emphasized parallel and real-time processing of basic           linear algebra modules for these application areas.                                  This project is about numerical linear algebra and applications            in signals, systems and control, with special emphasis on                       implementation aspects on parallel architectures.  The focus is on              \"special matrix\" problems, i.e. matrices which are either sparse,               patterned or structured.  For such matrices appropriate definitions of          numerical stability and sensitivity have recently been introduced.              Numerical methods for the above application areas ought to be                   numerically stable in this restricted sense and at the same time ought          to exploit the structure of the matrices to improve computational               complexity and parallelizability.  This will be applied to challenging          problems in these areas such as target tracking, robust control and             model reduction of large scale plants.",
