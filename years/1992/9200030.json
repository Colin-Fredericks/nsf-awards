 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the present time there are two programs within the National                  Science Foundation (NSF) specifically dedicated to enabling                     students at undergraduate institutions to participate in research               activities.  They are the Research Experience for Undergraduates                (REU) Program and the Research Experience for Undergraduate Site                Programs.  The REU Supplement Program allows current holders of NSF             grants or cooperative agreements to submit requests to provide                  support for an undergraduate student, while the Sites Program is                usually run at fairly large facilities where the infrastructure is              large enough to absorb the number of students and staff-time is                 available to co-ordinate the program.                                                                                                                           This award will provide a mechanism of access to research funds to              undergraduates not currently reached by these existing programs.                The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will administer a program               of REU supplements to be made available to faculty who currently                do not hold grants from the NSF but who wish to involve                         undergraduates in their research activities.  Applications will be              made directly to the AAS for support of such students.  The AAS                 will review the applications and select a group of twelve faculty               who will, subject to the approval of the NSF, receive funds from                this grant to enable an undergraduate at their institution to                   participate in the research activities of the faculty member.",
