 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study will continue and expand upon work on Ordovician and             Silurian explosively formed volcanic ashes which occur both in                  eastern North America and northwestern Europe for the purpose of                resolving some fundamental questions concerning the origin and                  distribution of these ash beds relative to the closing of the                   Iapetus Ocean, and the effect they may have had on mass extinction              of marine biota.  The enormous database of geochemical,                         petrographic, stratigraphic and paleontological information                     provides a unique opportunity to understand the tectonomagmatic                 framework within which large quantities of felsic subduction-                   related ash was injected into the stratosphere and widely                       distributed across large portions of Baltica, Avalonia and                      Laurentia.  It is clear that major centers of volcanism changed                 along the margins of Iapetus from Ordovician to Silurian time, but              the timing and location of these centers is not well understood.                We will look particularly at what we now believe to be a single,                ultraplinian eruptive event which deposited ash on both continental             margins of Iapetus and may have been derived from the same arc                  source as the Ammonoosuc Volcanics of southern New England.                     Resolving these questions will provide new clarifying information               about the tectonic events affecting the margin of Iapetus.                      Further, we propose to evaluate the event-stratigraphic and                     biologic implications of these events by selected, detailed studies             of widespread Ordovician and Silurian K-bentonites using isotopic               ages, chemical fingerprinting, and faunal studies.  Recognition of              one or more ash beds of both sides of the Atlantic will be an                   important contribution to furthering trans-Atlantic stratigraphic               correlation of Ordovician and Silurian strata.  Finally, in an                  effort to provide more insight into the likelihood that dust clouds             of global proportions have deleterious and long-lasting effects on              major groups of organisms, we will examine the evidence for                     biological mass extinctions that may have occurred as a results of              these catastrophic eruptions.",
