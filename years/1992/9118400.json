 "awd_abstract_narration": "The architecture of aquifers is of key concern in hydrogeology             because it largely controls the transport of subsurface fluids.                 Although geostatistical models can describe some aspects of aquifer             heterogeneity, there is information about geologic processes and                environments that has not been accounted for using models of                    spatial correlation and connectedness.  Using sedimentary process               simulation, petrophysics, geostatistics, and groundwater modelling,             this proposal aims to develop a geologic perspective on aquifer                 architecture.  This simulation approach explicitly considers the                geologic processes which control the evolution of aquifers and                  their resulting patterns of heterogeneity.  The proposed work will              focus on alluvial environments and study local facies within them.              Large-scale sedimentary process modelling provides complete three-              dimensional images.  The effect of the alluvial architecture on                 groundwater transport will be analyzed using three-dimensional                  groundwater flow and particle tracking.  Transport through                      simulated aquifers derived using geostatistical models will be                  compared with those derived using geologic process simulation.  It              is the ultimate aim of this work to develop a unified approach to               describe aquifer architecture by combining large-scale information              developed from geologic process simulation with geostatistical                  descriptions of local-scale variability.",
