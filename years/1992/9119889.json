 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theory suggests that ecosystem stability is a function of               physical and biological complexity.  Frequent disturbances may                  reduce this complexity and thereby destabilize ecosystems, making               them more susceptible to future perturbations.  Theory predicts                 that ecosystems with large scale physical (i.e. geomorphic)                     complexity can effectively maintain structural integrity when                   impacted by catastrophic disturbances.  This project will develop               a quantitative model that links changes in ecosystem structural                 complexity resulting from disturbances, to stability.  Because                  streams are strongly influenced by landscape geomorphology and                  respond relatively quickly to disturbances, stream ecosystems                   will be used.  Disturbance-stability relationships will be                      assessed in terms of logging impacts, landslides, and floods on                 general stream ecosystem dynamics, with special emphasis on fish                population responses.  To address the importance of large and                   small scale physical complexity, the model will be hierarchically               structured (i.e. contain basin, stream reach, and channel unit                  scales), and focus on examination of logging impacts at the                     stream reach scale.  Hypotheses developed and evaluated with this               model should provide new insights into how geomorphic complexity                interacts with disturbance to structure ecosystems and set the                  stage for the success or failure of biotic components.",
