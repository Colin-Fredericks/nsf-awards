 "awd_abstract_narration": "The difficulty of adequately delimiting boundaries on the                  basis of deficient geographical knowledge is an acknowledged                    fact.  A number of considerations must be made in studies of the                simultaneous mapping of a boundary by two different agencies,                   raising the issues of the authority of maps, the relationship                   between ground truth and interpretation, and objective reality                  versus subjective elements in mapping.  This project will address               the role of maps and cartography in the original U.S.-Mexican                   Boundary Survey of 1849-1855.  Cartographic documents have been                 largely overlooked while most research interest has centered on                 the general political and cultural history of the boundary.  A                  comparative analysis of cartographic and manuscript archives in                 both Washington, D.C. and Mexico City will form the basis of the                research plan.  Maps produced by the two boundary commissions and               the commentaries on the mapping process in the reports of the                   commissioners will be compared for information bearing on the                   role of maps in the making of the U.S.-Mexico boundary.  Analysis               should indicate the approach of each commission to the boundary-                making task as well as determine each commission's methods of                   dealing with specific geographical problems.                                         This research should contribute toward redressing an                       imbalance in borderland studies by examining the Mexican                        contribution to the boundary issues involved.  It will also                     examine the role of an abstraction, the map, in the                             representation of reality, a political boundary.  Finally, the                  research will assess the potential of maps in boundary-making in                general and on our present understanding of international                       boundary issues.",
