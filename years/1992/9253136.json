 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project will involve both ground-based and                   space-based observations of two small solar system bodies, the                  main belt asteroid, 1 Ceres, and the planet-crossing body, 2201                 Oljato.  Past observations of both these bodies have revealed                   possible evidence of volatile activity.  1 Ceres is the largest main            belt asteroid, and formed in the inner solar system between Mars                and Jupiter.  Recent observations at one limb of Ceres have                     shown emission at 3085 A attributable to OH molecules from                      dissociation of water.  2201 Oljato is in a short-lived orbit which             crosses the planets Mars, Earth, and Venus.  There is dynamical                 evidence indicating that it may have evolved from a comet-like                  orbit, and ultraviolet photometric measurements from which a                    reasonable production rate of water can be derived assuming the                 flux is due to fluorescence of OH molecules.  Both these objects                will be observed again during the tenure of the investigator's visit            to place upper limits on the abundance and production rates of                  common cometary volatiels OH, CN, C2 and C3 using                               observational experiments that are designed to place the most                   sensitive limits that are technically possible on the abundance of              these species.                                                                        The results of this project will enable us to compare the                 nature of volatile activity on an object which originated in the inner          solar system, with one that quite possibly is derived from the outer            solar system.                                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    teaching undergraduate courses for both the Astronomy and                       Geology Departments; supervising undergraduate students                         carrying out research projects; presenting departmental colloquia;              participating in colloquia planning to increase the participation of            women in the series; and interacting with regional chapters of the              Association of Women in Science.",
