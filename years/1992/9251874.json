 "awd_abstract_narration": "A microcomputer-based laboratory for the introductory physics                   classes has been established.  In addition to computers,                        appropriate interfaces and software lab apparatus that can be                   used for a variety of computer-based experiments in the first                   semester of the courses have been purchased.  The project has                   been designed around a network of Macintosh computers.  The                     universal lab interface developed by the Workshop Physics                       project and the Tools for Scientific Thinking project are being                 used with appropriate transducers to input data from air track                  and rotational mechanics apparatus.  This project serves to                     introduce the students in these courses to what has become the                  main method for data acquisition and analysis in scientific                     work today.  In addition several experiments that previously                    were not in our program have been introduced.  Upperclass                       physics majors have been instrumental in evaluating equipment                   and experiment possibilities for these labs.  We plan to                        continue to involve them in the lab development.  Eventually                    the project will evolve to the point that computers will be                     used in some capacity in almost every lab.  Interactive                         simulation software is being made available for the students to                 model experiments and study effects, such as air resistance,                    normally not accounted for.  This equipment is being used                       mainly by students in the introductory labs, but when not being                 used in that capacity, the computers are available for the                      upperclass majors to use.",
