 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Charles Cobb will conduct two seasons of archaeological site                survey and excavation in the Mill Creek region of Southern                      Illinois.  The region is important to archeologists because it                  contains quarries for stone which was manufactured into hoes.                   Finds from numerous other sites demonstated that these prized                   objects were then distributed throughout the lower Ohio and                     Mississippi River Valleys.  Dr. Cobb will first conduct an                      intensive sample survey of the area to obtain information on the                variety, distribution and function of sites related to digging                  implement production.  In the second stage of the work he will                  excavate a small sample of sites to learn how actual production                 of the implements was organized.  Materials collected will also                 help to date the sites and shed light on the subsistence                        practices followed.  Recovery of exchange items such as non-local               flint, galena, shell artifacts and copper will provide                          information on trade networks.                                                                                                                                  Although they did not develop all the features commonly                         attributed to \"civilizations\", late prehistoric (ca. 900-1500 AD)               societies in the American Midwest developed a high degree of                    social complexity in which individual groups were bound together                into larger organized trade networks.  Archaeologists have                      postuated that a tight link exists between the development of                   social complexity, political centralization and control of trade.               Because Mill Creek contained such a valuable product, it makes an               excellent region to examine this issue.  Through his excavations                Dr. Cobb wishes to learn how the production of stone hoes and                   their exchange was organized and functioned at both a local and                 an interregional level.                                                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 insight into how complex societies were developed and maintained.               It will yield data of great interest to many U.S. archaeologists.",
