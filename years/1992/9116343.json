 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the tradeoff between failure-free overhead           and output latency in transparent distributed rollback-recovery.  This          tradeoff arises because, with rollback-recovery, output to the                  \"outside world\" must be delayed until enough recovery information is            recorded on stable storage to guarantee that if a failure occurs, the           system will never roll back to a state preceding the one from which             the output was performed.  The resulting latency can be reduced by              keeping recovery information on stable storage closely up-to-date               during failure-free operation, but at the expense of extra failure-             free overhead.                                                                                                                                                  The work includes an investigation of how rollback-recovery methods             based on logging can be extended to support nondeterministic process            execution, occurring, for instance, as a result of multithreading.              Nondeterministic events are recorded on stable storage, and are used            during failure recovery to replay the same events.  For example, by             recording the execution of synchronization primitives such as                   semaphores, one can support multithreading in which all access to               shared data is protected by these synchronization primitives.                   Checkpoints offer an alternative for processes for which recording              nondeterministic events is impossible or is too expensive.",
