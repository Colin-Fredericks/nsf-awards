 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of the mechanisms by which central pattern generating             networks are formed during development requires the study of model              systems in which both the motor responses and the behavioral                    patterns can be studied simultaneously. One important invertebrate              model system, which has been studied extensively, is the                        stomatogastric ganglion of the adult lobster; this structure                    controls stomach movements. In this award, Dr. Joseph Ayers will                study the development feeding behavior and how it is coordinated                with the development of the motor patterns of the muscles                       controlled by the stomatogastric ganglion nerve cells. The basic                hypothesis is that early larval motor patterns are simple and that              the more complex patterns and adaptive reflexes characteristc of                adult specimens are elaborated in these larval stages as the motor              apparatus takes form. The video motion analysis system and                      correlated electromyographic recordings will be used to determine               the overall temporal organization of feeding behavior in the larvae             and how it changes from stage to stage, as well as how the motor                patterns are affected by the type of food. This research will                   contribute fundamental knowledge about the development and                      generation of motor patterns that control important functions such              as feeding behavior.",
