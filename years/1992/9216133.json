 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a research effort presently funded by NSF a novel liquid-                    liquid extraction processes is being investigated, which                        capitalizes on the properties of partially miscible solvents                    with a critical point of solubility.  In this process the                       critical mixture, together with the solute to be separated, is                  first heated above its critical temperature, where it forms a                   uniform solution, and then cooled to the thermodynamically                      unstable region below the miscibility curve where the solvents                  separate into who coexisting phases.  This new process was                      shown not only to be feasible, but also to extremely                            advantageous, above all when dealing with systems that tend to                  emulsify or form stable dispersions.  For example, it can                       handle a fermentation broth without using a centrifuge, which                   is a technical breakthrough with far-reaching implications in                   bioseparation.                                                                                                                                                  The high efficiency of the new separation process is due to a                   phenomenon that has never been reported in the literature:                      when phases separation after quenching below the coexistence                    curve, coalescence is not only greatly accelerated, but it is                   much less sensitive to impurities of both solvents and solutes                  than during isothermal operations.  The coalescence times of a                  fermentation broth can be reduced by three orders of magnitude                  by using the new separation technique in place of the                           traditional isothermal process, in which cause the formation                    of stable dispersions and emulsions.  The proposed research                     intends to investigate this phenomenon of accelerated                           coalescence in detail, using light-scattering and photographic                  techniques, accompanied by an attempt to formulate a                            quantitative theoretical explanation.  The results of this                      study will be of both scientific and technical interest in                      understanding the general phenomenon of hindered coalescence                    in solvent extraction and will shed some light on the phase                     separation of partially miscible mixtures due to cooling or                     heating across the coexistence curve.",
