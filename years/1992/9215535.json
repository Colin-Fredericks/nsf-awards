 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to assist the support of an international symposium               on probabilistic structural mechanics and advances in structural                reliability methods during June 7-10, 1993, It is to be held in                 San Antonio, Texas, USA under the auspices of the International                 Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (UTAM). The aim of the               symposium is to appraise the state-of-the-art, exchange                         information and views, and set direction for new research. It                   will facilitate a dialogue between engineers and scientists                     working in mechanics and materials, structural mechanics,                       structural engineering and construction engineering, and will                   simulate new developments and areas of research in the field. The               symposium will result in an authoritative high quality                          proceedings volume which will serve as a basic reference on the                 subject of probablistic structural mechanics and structural                     reliability.***  //",
