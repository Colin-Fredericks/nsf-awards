 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, Professor of Anthropology               at the University of Chicago, Mr. Martin Giesso will collect data               for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze lithic materials                 derived from the Bolivian site of Tiwanaku. In past work he has                 collected surface artifacts from many areas of this large site.                 With National Science Foundation support he will continue this                  work and conduct limited excavation at a locale believed to be a                lithics production workshop. He will also analyze the large                     sample already collected. He will collect data on variations in                 areal density, raw materials and types of stone implements                      represented. He will also reconstruct the production process to                 determine the degree of standardization. This will permit him to                examine the issue of craft specialization and through it the                    degree of economic specialization at the site. Mr. Giesso will                  also conduct a geological survey to locate raw material sources                 and then use neutron activation to tie worked material to point                 of origin. These latter data also will shed light on economic                   organization.                                                                                                                                                   Tiwanaku is a large archaeological site located in the Lake                     Titicaca Basin of Bolivia. Given its size, monumental                           architecture and broad influence it may defined as a \"State\" and                as such is the earliest one known in South America. It's origins                may be traced to ca. 300 B.C. While archaeologists know that                    states arose at about this time in many parts of the world, they                still do not understand in the detail the economic and political                processes involved. For example it is not clear whether craft                   specialization played either a causal role or was a result of                   such centralization. Mr. Giesso's research will help to answer                  this question.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will produce                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of how complex societies such as our own arose and                were maintained and will assist in the training of a promising                  young scientist.",
