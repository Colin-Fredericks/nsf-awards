 "awd_abstract_narration": "How much and what kinds of inequality should a society have?               This is one of the most basic questions for comparative social                  stratification research.  This project will collect data on social              inequality from respondents to the 1991 General Social Survey (the              major data collection supported in the field of sociology) as part              of the International Social Science Program, a continuing annual                program of cross-national collaboration .  The 1992 social                      inequality module replicates and extends the 1987 social inequality             module which was fielded in 10 countries.  In 1992, data collection             is expected in 20 countries.  These data will form the basis of                 cross-national comparisons, cross-time comparisons, and intra-                  individual comparisons.  The social inequality module measures                  beliefs and perceptions regarding social inequality in general and              income differences in particular.  It examines 1) factors people                believe influence social mobility, such as parental background,                 education, personal qualities, and fixed personal attributes; 2)                reasons for social inequality, such as a reward for occupations                 with greater responsibility or requiring more education, elite                  domination, and exploitation; 3) beliefs as to what people earn in              selected occupations and what they should earn; 4) support for                  government measures to provide for social welfare and promote                   income levelling; 5) the degree of social conflict between classes              and economic groups; 6) inter-generational changes in occupation,               education, and standard of living; 7) what factors should determine             wage differentials; and 8) whether a respondent would personally                benefit from a measure to equalize income.                                                                                                                           The project will contribute high-quality data that will create             an unprecedented opportunity in the study of social stratification              for linking knowledge of employment contexts, asked as a part of                the 1991 General Social Survey, with information about inequality.              The data collection will also make a contribution in the context                of the growing internationalization of sociological research.",
