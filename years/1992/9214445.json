This building houses the basic sciences                              departments which are involved in conducting                                    research including the departments of                                           Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology,                                         Pharmacology, and the Division of Biomedical                                    Sciences.  These departments are responsible for                                85% of the research grants that are awarded to                                  Meharry Medical College as well as 90% of the                                   publications.  Together, these departments train                                56 Ph.D. graduates, 46 of which are African-                                    Americans.                                                                           This award will be used to renovate current                                space in the West Basic Science Building.  Funds                                will also be used to modernize the Recombinant DNA                              Laboratory.  In addition, funds will be used for                                addressing the heating and cooling problems within                              the building that make it difficult at various                                  times during the year to conduct laboratory                                     research.  These renovations will result in 6-10                                new laboratories which will be available for                                    faculty.  The expansion of this facility will                                   increase the opportunity to train talented                                      minority graduate students in areas where a                                     national need exists and for which Meharry Medical                              College has an outstanding record.",
