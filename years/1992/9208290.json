 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator continues research on cellular                  control systems and delay differential equations, focussing on                  three main topics.  The first area is an interdisciplinary study                done in collaboration with Dr. J.  W. Zyskind on the modeling of                initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli.  Using                       mathematical models, they attempt to explain which are the most                 important steps in the beginning of the DNA replication cycle.                  Several other regulatory processes for growing cells are                        examined, providing additional insight into cellular control                    systems and introducing new dynamical systems to study.  The                    second area of inquiry analyzes the stability region for a linear               differential equation with two delays.  Both analytical and                     numerical techniques are used to determine how the stability                    region varies with the parameters in this equation.  The                        stability region varies dramatically for even small changes in                  some parameters, so studying these anomalies is very important                  from a modeling point of view.  The final area of investigation                 examines mathematical models for erythropoiesis and                             thrombopoiesis.  Previous models have included two delays linking               this study to the previous one.  More recently, models have been                developed using either state-dependent delays or age-structured                 modeling.  The principal investigator has developed a new                       age-structured model that more accurately reflects the biology in               hematopoietic systems.  He will undertake mathematical studies to               determine the qualitative behavior of this model and to examine                 how it compares to models with either multiple delays or                        state-dependent delays.  Parameter identification methods may                   provide quantitative information for how these systems can become               unstable in certain disease states.                                                  The principal objective of this project is to develop                      mathematical models that correspond to known biological behavior.               The models will provide insight into the mechanisms that govern                 the specific biological problem.  DNA replication marks the                     beginning of the cell cycle in bacteria.  An understanding of the               controls underlying the cell cycle is important for other areas                 of research, including genetic engineering and cancer research.                 The mathematical studies provide support for certain biological                 experiments, suggest further avenues of experimentation, and show               how some biological theories are impossible.  The computer                      simulations of cellular processes require less time to perform                  than experiments and are significantly less costly.  However, it                is the interaction between the experimenter and the mathematical                modeler in this study that will be most important to the                        advancement in understanding the cell cycle.  Mathematical models               for erythropoiesis or red blood cell production can elucidate the               effects of certain changes in this complicated process that                     begins with simple undifferentiated cells in the bone marrow and                proceeds to mature red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout               the body.  The models may explain the mechanisms underlying                     certain blood diseases and suggest possible therapeutic                         procedures.  The models could aid in developing new procedures to               efficiently collect blood, which is significant for patients who                choose to provide their own blood supply for elective surgery and               avoid risks of HIV infection.  The work includes several novel                  mathematical techniques that will advance fundamental research                  tools available for future mathematical studies.  These tools                   will be applicable to a wide range of problems in applied                       mathematics.",
