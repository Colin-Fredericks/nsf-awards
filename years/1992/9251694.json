 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a closed-loop, servohydraulic system to                       enhance the quality of laboratory instruction in three required                 undergraduate courses in the School of Civil Engineering at the                 Georgia Institute of Technology: Materials of Construction,                     Physical Properties of Soils and Rocks, and Experimental                        Structural Analysis.  The equipment provides these classes with                 a state-of-the-art, computer controlled system capable of                       applying cyclic loads, and allows the students to perform                       critical and innovative experiments on conventional and                         emerging materials. The new experiments emphasize tests                         involving fatigue and cyclic behavior of conventional and new                   engineering materials such as plastics and high-strength                        fiber-reinforced composites.  Repair and rehabilitation methods                 and the testing of connections are included in the experimental                 program.  Students are also exposed to techniques for field                     testing of soils that are important to geotechnical site                        assessments.  The system is similar to state-of-the-art                         equipment that students will most likely encounter in industry                  after graduation.",
