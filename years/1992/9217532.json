 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Kirch, MS Julie Endicott, a                  graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, will                collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Working in conjunction              with her advisor she will conduct archaeological excavations on                 Mangaia, one of the Cook Islands. Excavation to date indicates that             Mangaia was settled by Polynesian peoples and developed a chieftan              level of society. To date however no villages have been excavated               and little is known about how households and larger settlement                  units were organized. MS Endicott will conduct large areal                      excavations of open terraces which contain habitation sites. Work               will involve the removal of overburden and careful exposure of                  habitation floors. The spatial distribution of artifacts and                    features will be recorded and artifactual, faunal and floral                    materials recovered will be returned to Berkeley for analysis.                  Sediment samples will be taken to provide information about                     depositional processes. Through this work MS Endicott hopes to                  elucidate the structural context within which household activities              took place, identify individual activities and note variation from              household to household.                                                                                                                                         Polynesian peoples have been the focus of intensive anthropological             study because of the extreme variation in social organization which             has been noted among different groups. Within a relatively short                time span Polynesians expanded from a Southeast Asian point of                  origin and populated many of the islands of the Pacific.                        Anthropologists believe that through comparison across island                   groups one can gain insight into the underlying processes of                    cultural adaptation and change. However to accomplish this goal one             must set present day groups into a broader historical context and               MS Endicott's work is directed towards this end. Very little is                 known about prehistoric organization at the important household                 level and this work will help to fill the gap.                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of how cultural diversity originates and is                       maintained. It will also assist in the training of a promising                  young scientist.",
