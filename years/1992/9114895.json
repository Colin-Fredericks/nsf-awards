 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis and design of structures for earthquake resistance                 requires reliable estimates of the ground shaking expected at the               site.  Current procedures for the evaluation of these seismic                   ground motion characteristics tend to be empirical and result in                estimates that are restricted to the particular earthquake and                  site for which they were developed.  The results of such analyses               therefore may not be suitable for general seismic response                      analyses of structures.                                                                                                                                         This research program addresses the task of establishing reliable               estimates for the description parameters that influence the                     seismic motions at a site.  The multitude of recorded earthquake                data at SMART-1 (Strong Motion Array in Taiwan-1) and the newly                 developed techniques for decomposing the motions into their                     dominant wave components is used for this purpose.  The analysis                of the dominant wave characteristics at the site for a number of                earthquakes provides a basis with which to evaluate general                     expressions for the stochastic characteristics of the seismic                   motions (power and cross spectral densities of the motions in                   three orthogonal directions, their rotational components and                    their spatial variability).  The development of attenuation                     equations that relate the stochastic descriptions of the motions                with the earthquake and site characteristics is being explored.",
