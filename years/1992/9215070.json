 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to develop the                                    materials and processing capabilities required                                  to fabricate an optical micro-switch for fiber                                  optic networks.  The switch consists of a                                       polymer channel waveguide fabricated on a                                       cantilevered micromechanical beam.  This                                        beam can be coupled to one of the two                                           stationary polymer guides using an electrostatic                                comb drive.  All three polymer guides are                                       coupled to fiber pigtails via V-groove                                          alignment.  The use of polymer waveguides                                       instead of fibers drastically reduces the                                       reduces the required motion for alignment                                       (and therefore the required switching power).                                   Micromechanics, in addition to producing the                                    switching action, makes fiber alignment and                                     packaging relatively straightforward.                                           Fabrication of such a device will require the                                   marriage of high aspect ratio x-ray lithography                                 fabrication and polymer processing.  The                                        micromechanical switch is fabricated in metal                                   because of its superior mechanical properities.                                 The optical waveguides are fabricated using                                     polymers whose optical properties can be                                        tailored for a variety of applications.  The                                    materials challenges to be addressed include                                    the tailoring of the mechanical properties of                                   electroplated metal films, the control of the                                   optical properties of polymers, and the                                         understanding of the long term reliability of                                   the materials used.  This device represents a                                   synthesis of polymer, x-ray lithographic, and                                   micromechanical processing.  The materials                                      and processes developed for this work will be                                   useful for a wide array of applications in solid                                state circuits, sensors and actuators, and                                      photonics.",
