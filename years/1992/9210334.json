 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project carries out research on the behavior of inventories                and unfilled orders.  The contributions of this research to this                line of work are important because unfilled orders play a very                  significant role in business cycles and in the overall volatility               of national output, yet there is relatively little empirical                    research on unfilled orders and there is no adequate theoretical                explanation of the reasons why unfilled orders and inventories are              positively correlated.  One would think that increases in                       inventories would reduce unfilled orders, but that is not what the              preliminary evidence shows.  The research builds on earlier work                on the stockout-avoidance motive for inventories in two main                    directions:  First, it extends the stockout-avoidance model to                  allow for strictly convex costs of production and inventory                     holding.  Second, it incorporates the joint determination of                    inventories and unfilled orders.  This is useful not only for those             industries in which orders data are available.  Many                            industries (most notably the automobile industry) are known to have             orders, but data on them are not available.  Consequently current               sales or shipments partly reflect unmeasured unfilled orders.  The              model developed will resolve this problem.                                                                                                                      The project also explores some new evidence of increasing                       marginal cost and extends the stockout-avoidance model to allow                 for it.  Because the model is not linear-quadratic, and it                      explicitly incorporates non-negativity constraints on                           inventories, this extension is non-trivial and leads to the use of              some numerical methods that may themselves be of independent                    interest.  Preliminary work focused on evidence related to the                  slope of marginal cost.  The extreme sensitivity of inventory                   behavior in the model to small departures from zero marginal cost               suggests that marginal cost may be very close to flat.",
