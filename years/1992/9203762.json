 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue work on the existence of                    definable counterexamples to the continuum hypothesis in the                    presence of strong axioms, the aim being to prove their non-                    existence.  This has already yielded rich dividends in both                     combinatorial and descriptive set theory.  He will also continue                work connecting amenable and non-amenable group actions with set                theory.  Furthermore, he will try to extend his previous solution               to the famous \"Marczewski Problem\" about Banach-Tarski paradoxes to             arbitrary non-amenable groups of homeomorphisms of Polish spaces.               This will provide an exact characterization of paradoxical                      decompositions of Polish spaces using sets with the property of                 Baire.  He will also investigate newly discovered connections                   between logic and set theory on the one hand and topological                    dynamics and ergodic theory on the other.                                            A famous paradox of measure theory, the Banach-Tarski paradox,             shows that ordinary intuition about volumes of sets in three-                   dimensional space is unreliable.  In particular, if the sets are                allowed to be sufficiently bizarre, certainly not anything that can             be drawn or easily imagined, then a solid ball in 3-space can be                dissected into a finite number of sets, and these sets can be                   rearranged and reassembled to form two solid balls, each congruent              to the original one.  An old question that had resisted numerous                attempts was whether the sets involved in such a paradoxical                    decomposition of the ball could have at least a minimal degree of               regularity known as the property of Baire.  Although not easy to                draw or imagine, non-measurable sets with the property of Baire do              arise in classical analysis and so are not considered so remote                 from reality as to be easy to ignore altogether.  The investigator              and a co-worker have defied widely held suspicions that such                    decompositions are impossible, developed some technical machinery               for treating this and related questions, and shown that such                    decompositions do indeed exist.  Other topics in pure set theory                and its applications will be considered.",
