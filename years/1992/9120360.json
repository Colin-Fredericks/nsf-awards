 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at the development and application of                 methods in optical rheometry to measure the dynamics and structures             of multicomponent polymer liquids when subjected to processing                  conditions.  Such liquids are characterized by dynamics associated              with specific structural constituents that should be separated to               properly understand the response of these materials to external                 fields.  This separation can refer to the isolation of the dynamics             as a function of length scales existing in the liquid, or                       associated with specific chemical components.  The former class of              systems would include phase-separated blends where the response of              the domain structure must be isolated.  Scattering techniques are               the obvious choices for these cases and for structural length                   scales in the range of 0.5 to 20 um, small-angle light scattering               and scattering dichroism will be used for this purpose.                         Spectroscopic techniques are required when the dynamics of                      individual chemical elements must be identified.  Infrared                      polarimetry and Raman scattering will be developed and applied to               single-phase polymer blends and melts.  The specific tasks that                 will be carried out are:                                                                                                                                        1.)  For miscible, single-phase blends, it is important to                      understand the composition and temperature dependence of the                    friction factors of the individual components.  An additional piece             of information that is required is the entanglement molecular                   weight as a function of composition.  To address these goals,                   infrared dichroism and a new technique, polarization modulated                  Raman scattering, will be used to spectroscopically identify                    specific chemical constituents.                                                                                                                                 2.)  In systems where shear can affect the phase behavior of a                  multicomponent system, both scattering and spectroscopic techniques             will be used to examine the structure over a wide range of                      structural length scales.  For systems with a dispersed phase,                  small-angle light scattering will be used to monitor the                        deformation of those droplets.  This will be carried out for                    systems where the viscosity ratio of the components making up the               mixtures is varied.  To examine the interactions that drive                     miscibility or phase separation, a new technique, two-dimensional               Raman scattering will be developed.  This method will offer the                 capability of measuring orientation correlations between distinct               elements comprising a sample.  Finally, excimer fluorescence will               be developed as a technique to probe interactions over extremely                small (10 angstrom) length scales.
