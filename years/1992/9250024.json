The                systemic change will be based on the Re:learning model of school-               based reform and will incorporate new content, pedagogy and                     assessment in mathematics and science.  The project will:                                                                                                       1.   establish a state-level Council of stakeholders to provide                      guidance and oversight for systemic change activities;                                                                                                     2.   establish regional technical assistance centers whose staffs                    will work directly with K-8 schools in implementing systemic                    change;                                                                                                                                                    3.   initiate staff development programs in approximately 90                         elementary and middle schools in each year of the program,                      with each school participating in a two-year program of                         summer and academic year staff development activities guided                    by the Re:Learning model of school-based change;                                                                                                           4.   assist in the development/dissemination of state standards,                     assessment systems, teacher licensure requirements, and                         staff development policies which are aligned with the                           standards being prepared by the NCTM, NSTA, and AAAS;                                                                                                      5.   support post-secondary curriculum reforms and community                         organizations initiatives which are consistent with (4)                         above;                                                                                                                                                     6.   encourage the engagement of resources and programs which                        support the other objectives of the systemic initiative;                                                                                                   7.   create the conditions needed to reduce the performance gaps                     typically associated with gender and ethnicity in math and                      science performance; and                                                                                                                                   8.   evaluate annual progress in meeting these goals.                            ***",
