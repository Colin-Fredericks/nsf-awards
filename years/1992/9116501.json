Professor Guo                 is conducting a study of non-adiabatic transition dynamics in                   the photodissociation of small molecules, including new                         three-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations of the                        photodissociation dynamics of alkyl iodides in the gas phase.                   Professor Guo's new approach treats the dissociation degree of                  freedom by a quantum wavepacket method while characterizing                     environment motions by classical trajectories.  The quantum and                 classical subsystems are coupled via the Ehrenfest scheme so                    that the wavepacket and the trajectory can be propagated                        self-consistently.                                                              %%%                                                                             Most chemical reactions can be adequately understood as                         involving reactant and product molecules in their ground                        electronic states.  However, there are many important                           reactions, including most processes that are initiated by                       ultraviolet radiation, for which the reaction process involves                  interaction between the ground and excited electronic states.                   A new theoretical method is being tested that should permit                     prediction of the probability of such processes and thereby                     contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of processes                  initiated by light.",
