 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide approximately half the funds needed                to acquire an automated X-ray diffractometer. The additional funds              necessary for this acquisition have been committed by the                       University of Wyoming. This instrument will be one of the central               analytical instruments to enable ongoing research in                            geochemistry,clay mineralogy, and clastic diagenesis within the                 Geology Department. It will also be used by faculty and students                engaged in studies of mineral assemblages in igneous and                        metamorphic rocks. Researchers in soil and environmental chemistry              are also expected to be users. This new automated instrument will               replace old diffractometers which are no longer capable of                      performing up to today's standards. This new diffractometer will                also make it possible to teach undergraduates and graduates in                  mineralogy and petrology courses with state-of-the-art                          instrumentation. A full-time experienced staff member will be                   responsible for instrument maintenance and will train and assist                users.",
