 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Myron Charles Baker of                       Colorado State University to the University of Western                          Australia to work with Dr. Michael S. Johnson on behavioral                     and genetic components of the process by which new species                      are created in birds.  Behavioral studies of song recognition                   by several species of Australian birds (the Fairy Wren multi-                   species complex) will be carried out by playback                                experimentation in natural populations.  These results will                     form the basis for further investigations of features of the                    reproductive communication used in mate choice and will                         provide understanding of the differing degrees of divergence                    among the several species and subspecies.  The researchers                      will conduct genetic studies as an extension of an ongoing                      research program in North America.  Tissue samples from two                     closely-related species of buntings, and their hybrids, will                    be taken by Dr. Baker to a biochemical systematics laboratory                   at the University of Western Australia to be examined with                      enzyme and molecular techniques.  The results will address                      the question of the nature of gene exchange in a pair of                        species that may be in the process of completing their                          isolation as a new species.",
