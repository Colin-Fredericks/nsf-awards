 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to provide training for 50                            Kindergarten teachers and assistants over a period of three                     years and to maximize the implementation of the new                             Kindergarten Science curriculum which was recently developed                    in the Carroll County Public School System.  This curriculum                    is based on a constructivist approach, and incorporates                         educational approaches which are suitable for young children.                   Teachers will be provided with the necessary content and                        process knowledge in science, and Kindergarten Instructional                    Assistants will be trained to ensure their role in                              successfully supporting science instruction in the classroom.                   A leadership team will be developed to provide support to                       colleague teachers and appropriate science inservice and peer                   coaching to new Kindergarten teachers coming into the school                    system.                                                                                                                                                         This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because of its plan to enhance in a substantive way                     the science teaching of all Kindergarten teachers in the                        Carroll County MD public school system, and because of its on-                  going plan to provide inservice to new Kindergarten teachers                    coming into the system.                                                                                                                                         Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 66% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
