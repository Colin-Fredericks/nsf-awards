 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial neural networks (ANN's) are a rich and interesting class             of nonlinear models developed recently by cognitive scientists.                 Although inspired by certain features of the neural architecture                of the brain, these models have considerable potential for use in               econometrics and economics because of their simplicity and great                flexibility.  Specifically, ANN models show promise as the basis                for nonparmetric estimation and for specification testing because               of their ability to approximate arbitrary elements of general                   function spaces to arbitrary accuracy.  Under previous NSF grants,              this project focused on establishing the mathematical and                       statistical foundations necessary for using ANN models in                       nonparametric estimation and specification testing.  The research               proposed in this accomplishment based renewal is to continue                    development of these foundations, to establish properties of ANN-               based nonparametric estimators, and to apply the resulting theory               to construct model specification tests.                                                                                                                         The areas in which mathematical and statistical theory will be                  pursued are two.  The first area is the establishment of degree of              approximation results for ANN models in Sobolev spaces.  The second             area is to obtain central limit theorems and invariance principles              for random elements constructed as partial sums of a dependent                  process (specifically, a mixingale process) in a Hilbert space.                 The application areas make direct use of the proposed theoretical               results to model learning by economic agents.",
