 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are one species in an ecological community.  The functioning             of the ecological community can strongly affect human well-being.               One approach to understanding an ecological community uses food                 webs.  Food webs describe who eats whom in an ecological community.             Food webs are important to human health and well-being because                  chemical and biological toxins are often concentrated, and                      metabolized energy is lost, in each predator-prey link of the food              webs.  The aim of the study is to show that the diverse structures              of reported food webs may be explained by a small number of general             principles, and to use these general principles to understand the               structure and dynamics of ecological communities.  An understanding             of food webs has practiced applications.  In collaboration with the             International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, the food              web of rice fields will be constructed and analyzed.  This study                may yield novel suggestions for improved biological control of                  agricultural pests and provides an opportunity to test basic                    scientific generalizations about food web structure.  A substantial             effort will be devoted to answering new questions of mathematics,               statistics, and computation raised by the study of ecology and                  populations.  There is intellectual leverage in developing                      mathematical tools for studying biological problems, because                    experience shows that concepts, models, and analytical techniques               developed in one biological setting are frequently helpful in                   others.",
