Thorium fluxes as measured by the sediment trap              will be compared with predicted thorium fluxes from the in situ                 scavenging.  To avoid historical problems with the interpretation               of single thorium profiles, an expanded experiment will be                      performed in which both the thorium scavenging through time and the             variability in space will be followed.  The new profiling technique             also averages the entire water column vertically, thus ensuring                 that any small-scale thorium minima in the profile will be                      quantitatively included.  This set of measurements will provide the             most unambiguous prediction to date of the thorium-bearing particle             flux that a sediment trap is predicted to collect.  If the sediment             trap measured thorium flux differs greatly from the predicted                   value, it will be able to be concluded that the trap does not                   quantitatively collect the particles that are responsible for                   thorium transport and thus may be unlikely to be accurate for other             particle classes as well.  If the values agree, it can be concluded             that the trap is accurate for the particles that transport thorium              and thus suggest that they may be accurate for other particle                   classes as well.  In either case, this experiment will demonstrate              a robust method for the calibration of sediment trap data in the                field that will be useful for other experiments on trap performance             (e.g. hydrodynamics).",
