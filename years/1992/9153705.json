 "awd_abstract_narration": "The immediate goal of this two year program is to provide                       20 high school science teachers from the New York area with                     practical experience in research in modern biology,                             biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, genetics and                             molecular biology so that they can transmit to their                            students knowledge gained regarding content, scientific                         method, and the excitement of scientific research. The                          program was created to develop a partnership in science                         education between high school science teachers and                              University faculty  and to encourage sustained associations                     between them. Participants in the program are committed to                      working in a Columbia University research laboratory for at                     least two consecutive summers. A major premise of the                           program is that affiliations of science teachers with                           research laboratories and practicing scientists will                            provide the teachers with a better appreciation of the                          excitement of scientific discovery, the tools and                               technologies of modern biology and chemistry, the                               trajectory of a scientist's career and the realities of                         working as a scientist.                                                                                                                                         Based on the knowledge and experience gained during the                         summer research experience, teachers are expected to plan                       and implement a series of activities in their schools                           during the following academic years. These activities may                       include inservice offerings, implementation of new student                      laboratory experiences, new curriculum projects, field                          trips to research laboratories, or other appropriate                            activities.                                                                                                                                                     An amount equal to 42.4 % of NSF cost will be provided as                       cost share.",
