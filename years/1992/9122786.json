 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the theoretical models of national economic growth                      developed in the last three decades have incorporated                           endogenously-generated human capital and knowledge capital, and                 thus have gone beyond the simple aggregate production function,                 introduced by Solow in the 1950s, which included only physical                  capital, raw labor, and exogenous technical change.  Numerous                   empirical cross-country studies of long-run economic growth have                been performed in the last few years, but they have accounted for               human and knowledge capital accumulation imperfectly if at all.                 This may have resulted in biased parameter estimates (especially                of the elasticity of output with respect to physical capital)                   and/or indirect and inefficient hypothesis testing procedures.                  This project investigates several important long-run growth                     theories using a cross-country data set that includes relatively                long (20-30 years minimum) series on education, R&D, intellectual               property and related variables for about 70-90 countries.  Use of               these data should permit substantially improved statistical                     inference concerning the economic growth process.",
