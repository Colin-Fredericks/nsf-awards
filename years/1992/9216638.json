Suitable environments have been identified and will be                     carefully analyzed for the presence of microhabitats the could                  sustain photoferrrotrophy.  These environments include iron-rich                                                                                                acid mine drainage areas, iron springs, and the sediments of                    shallow iron rich lakes.  The microhabitats will be sought by                   using                                                                           microelectrodes to find anoxic microzones that are exposed to                   light                                                                           and that are high in ferrous iron, low in sulfide, and of neutral                                                                                               or acidic pH.  Once suitable microhabitats have been found,                     samples                                                                         will be collected for microscopy, pigment content, and culture to                                                                                               attempt to isolate a photoferrotroph.",
