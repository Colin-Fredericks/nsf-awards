 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to produce a tool critical for                  further studies of soybeans:  a collection of large, cloned                     segments of DNA (P1 library) from two lines:  (1) an elite line                 (BSR101) which has superior genes at most loci and which is                     representative of the broader germplasm used for breeding; and                  (2) one which carries exotic genes, including those for resistance              to soybean cyst nematode (SCN), a serious pathogen.  Dr. Danna                  will screen the cloned DNA to identify segments that hybridize to               molecular markers tightly linked to the SCN-resistance loci.  The               cloned segments will be useful for obtaining new markers more                   tightly linked to these important genes and for eventual isolation of           the genes for transfer to other lines of soybean.  The P1 libraries             produced will be useful in addressing fundamental questions about               the soybean, including sequence organization of the genome and                  its evolutionary history from a wild ancestor species.                                The long term goals of this project are to contribute to the              fundamental understanding of the molecular biology and genetics                 of soybean and to facilitate the manipulation of soybean                        germplasm for crop improvement.                                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:  giving            guest lectures on virology; teaching an undergraduate seminar                   course on \"Women in Biology,\" with both an historical perspective               and a focus on contemporary biologists; arranging for guest                     lecturers, who will also present departmental seminars; organizing              an informal discussion group for women in the biology department                to provide a framework for \"networking,\" and to provide                         counseling and mentoring for women students.",
