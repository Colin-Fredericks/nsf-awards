 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of                           experiments which are being incorporated into an instrumental                   analysis laboratory manual which emphasizes bioanalytical                       determinations, includes standard laboratory practices, and                     incorporates an ordering of experiments that is related to                      actual steps in problem-solving.  The project centers around                    improving the instruction which is involved in instrumental and                 physical measurements courses which are usually offered in the                  third or fourth year of study.  The problems common to such                     courses which this project is working to overcome include                       insufficient emphasis on bioanalytical experiments, an order of                 topics covered that is based on the complexity of a technique                   rather than the steps followed in problem-solving, and pedagogy                 that is overly biased toward illustration of a measurement                      concept at the expense of standard laboratory practices.",
