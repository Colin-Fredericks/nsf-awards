 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is purchasing a modern Fourier                         Transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer to catalyze a major                      revision of laboratory and lecture courses in all of the                        sciences.  This instrument is used to introduce basic                           spectrometry to students, particularly those in teacher                         education programs, who presently are not exposed to this type                  of analysis.  At the upper division level, the instrument                       allows for fast, simple, and highly accurate analysis of a                      variety of processes and compounds.  Courses affected include                   general, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry; as well as                 courses in instrumental and chemical analysis, and introductory                 physics.  As part of the Department's ongoing involvement in                    local pre-college education, the instrument provides for                        workshops and advanced laboratory experiences for both teachers                 and their students, and the development of new approaches to                    teaching science in middle and high schools.",
