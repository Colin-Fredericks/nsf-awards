 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this request for an International Travel Grant is                to help offset the costs involved in enabling four (4) members of               the American Physiological Society (APS) to attend and participate              in the Inaugural Congress of the African Association of                         Physiological Sciences (AAPS). The venue for the Congress will be               Nairobi, Kenya from September 21 through 2, 1992.                                                                                                               All four individuals have been specifically invited to participate              in the Congress by either the Secretary-General of the AAPS, Dr.                K.O. Adeniyi of the University of Jos in Jos, Nigeria, and/or the               Congress Chairman, Dr. John Ibu, also of the University of Jos. The             letter of invitation to Dr. Daniel Richardson, the PI of this grant             proposal, is attached. Letters to the other three invited                       individuals can be produced if their specific rolls in the Congress             are provided in this proposal.                                                                                                                                  The purpose of the AAPS Congress is to provide a forum for                      scientists from the African countries to interact with their                    International counterparts. The Congress will consist of invited                lectures, research symposia and a considerable number of education              workshops. As such the interactions between American and African                physiologists is expected to lead to the formation of joint                     scientific and education projects that would be executed in Africa              with the aim of fostering biomedical science teaching and research              in African nations. According to K.O. Adeniyi, AAPS Secretary-                  General, one potential benefit of such interactions is that they                would help to stem the tide of scientific brain drain from these                regions.                                                                                                                                                        The invited American physiologists are expected not only to present             lectures on their invited topics, but to participate in the                     organizational aspects of the congress as well. For the most part               the latter will take the form of chairing symposia and/or                       workshops. Finally, the Americans are encouraged to interact with               young members and help direct them towards achieving greater                    heights in science and education. //",
