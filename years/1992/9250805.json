 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CSULA Department of Physics has initiated a new approach to                 upper-division laboratory instruction by developing an                          integrated sequence of four courses.  The key feature of this                   program is that the students utilize skills learned in computer                 interfacing and experimental methods to design and assemble the                 apparatus they will use for a final independent experiment on                   the optical properties of thin film semiconductors.  Our goal                   is that each undergraduate develops laboratory literacy in the                  skills that they will need in order to be able to work                          independently on research projects in either industry or                        graduate school.  This project provides equipment for a major                   experiment in this program.  Interfacing equipment such as                      stepper motor controllers, IEEE and A/D converters allow                        students in the first two courses to determine experimental                     parameters and design control and acquisition programs.  The                    spectrometer, power supplies, lock-in amplifiers and deposition                 rate monitor allow students in the following two courses                        optically to analyze thin film semiconductor samples using the                  data control and analysis systems determined in the first                       courses.  A previous pilot project has indicated the potential                  success of this method.",
