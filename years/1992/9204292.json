 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will work on three projects.  The first is a              continuation of work with Mladen Bestvina (U.C.L.A.) on                         automorphisms of the free group.  They hope to prove a                          classification theorem for subgroups of polynomial growth                       automorphisms and thereby complete the proof of the Tits                        Alternative for Out(Fn).  Secondly, the investigator hopes to prove             that there are no minimal homeomorphisms of the once punctured                  plane, which would answer a question of Besicovitch and of Herman.              Finally, the investigator, in collaboration with Bruce Kitchens                 (I.B.M.), will explore the relationship between two natural                     definitions of topological entropy for homeomorphisms of non-                   compact spaces.                                                                      The topology of surfaces is a highly developed subject,                    addressing properties which remain invariant when a surface is                  stretched or twisted without tearing it, so-called rubber sheet                 geometry.  The theory of dynamical systems is another highly                    developed subject, addressing questions about transformations of a              space into itself, such simple things as rotations of spheres, but              also far more complicated transformations.  For transformations of              surfaces, the topology is intimately involved and says a great deal             about what kinds of transformations are possible.  Extracting this              information by combining the topology of surfaces with the theory               of dynamical systems is a sophisticated endeavor which forms a                  large part of this project.",
