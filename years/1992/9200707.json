 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies of chloroplast DNA variation in the                       Asteraceae have resolved many systematic issues at higher taxonomic             levels.  However, major problems persist in resolving tribal                    relationships and the monophyly of the subfamily Lactucoideae.  An              expanded examination of chloroplast DNA variation in the Asteraceae             is proposed using comparative restriction site mapping of 10                    enzymes and DNA sequencing of two genes (rpoC2 and ndhF) from                   representative species in all currently recognized tribes in the                family.  These new data will be combined with those from previous               chloroplast DNA studies to address both phylogenetic and molecular              evolutionary questions.  Integration of molecular and morphological             data will produce a comprehensive phylogeny and classification of               the Asteraceae.  Fine scale restriction site and gene mapping will              enable the first direct comparisons of the phylogenetic utility of              restriction site mutations in coding and noncoding regions of the               chloroplast genome.  Similarly, the availability of DNA sequences               of three genes (rbcL, rpoC2, ndhF) will provide much needed                     comparisons of the usefulness of different chloroplast genes for                phylogenetic studies in angiosperms.  Statistical analyses of                   restriction site and sequence data will be used to examine the                  patterns and rates of sequence evolution in the chloroplast genome.             Identification of heterogeneity in the location of restriction site             mutations will provide valuable information for character analysis              in future molecular systematic studies in the Asteraceae and other              angiosperm families.  Furthermore, new insights will be gained into             the rates and patterns of nucleotide substitutions within and                   between coding and noncoding sequences from three chloroplast genes             with different functions and locations in the chloroplast genome.",
