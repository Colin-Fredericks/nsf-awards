 "awd_abstract_narration": "The James Entomological Collection at Washington State                     University is one of the largest University collections of insects              in the country.  The Collection is representative in all major                  groups of insect orders and contains approximately 1.25 million                 specimens.  It is especially strong in Diptera (flies), Coleoptera              (beetles), Lepidoptera (moth and butterflies), Hemiptera (bugs),                and Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) and maintains a collection of type             material.  Begun in 1892, the holdings of the Collection are of                 significant historical as well as scientific importance.  It is one             of the few collections which can provide specimens from the Pacific             Northwest and thus serves as an important regional and national                 resource.                                                                                                                                                            The Collection has moved to new facilities (December 1992)                 which were actually designed as a collection room with adjoining                offices and library.  The addition of new drawers , cabinets, and               pinning trays, will provide adequate housing for specimens which                are now stored in substandard housing.  Funding also allows us to               house our material in a single style of drawer (USNM) for the first             time in the history of the Collection and, because of the                       efficiency of the new drawers, eliminates the problems of on going              pest infestations and the constant need for fumigants.  The                     addition of technical help allows for the transfer of specimens                 form the old housing to the new with only a minimum disruption to               the day-to-day activities of the Collection.  Washington State                  University agrees to fund 30% of equipment (housing) costs.",
