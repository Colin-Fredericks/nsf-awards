 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop models which                  consider the possibility of future innovations while taking                     acquisition and replacement decisions.  In particular, the research             focuses on a capacity expansion and replacement model wherein a                 sequence of technological breakthroughs are anticipated but their               magnitude and timing are uncertain.  A firm, operating in such an               environment, must decide how much capacity of the current best                  available technology to acquire to meet the future demand growth.               It must also determine whether to replace any of the older vintages             partially or completely, with the focus on obsolescence rather than             deterioration as the motive for replacement.  Such decisions are                of the essence in electronics and other industries characterized                by rapid technological change.                                                       This research also considers the interaction between product               life cycles and manufacturing flexibility in a rapidly changing                 market.  This work is motivated by the economic analysis of                     investment decisions in flexible assembly lines for automobile                  assembly.  The advent of future generations of products lead to                 obsolescence of dedicate transfer lines.  Flexible lines, on the                other hand, can process successive generations of product.  The                 high investment required in flexible assembly line is weighed                   against the reduced obsolescence of such lines.",
