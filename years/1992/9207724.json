 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike most animals which have individuals with separate male and               female sexes, plants exhibit a great range in breeding systems.                 Most plant species are hermaphroditic with male and female function             in the same flower, but many other species, including a number of               important crop plants, have separate male and female flowers on the             same plant or consist of populations of separate male and female                plants (dioecy).  Many different hypotheses have been proposed to               explain the diversity of breeding systems in plants and the                     evolution of dioecy.  One major argument suggests that dioecy has               evolved to avoid inbreeding depression.  Inbreeding depression                  occurs when closely related individuals mate and the resulting                  offspring show reduced vigor and ability to reproduce.  If                      inbreeding depression is a factor, then one should expect to find               both high levels of inbreeding self-pollination occurring as well               as high levels of inbreeding depression in populations that are                 evolving dioecy.  Although there have been many theories proposed,              very little empirical data on this question is available.  We are               examining the role of inbreeding depression in the evolution of                 dioecy in the Hawaiian plant genus Schiedea.  This group is                     apparently evolving dioecy and exhibits a range of breeding systems             in very closely related species.  This research is of special                   urgency because many important intermediate species from the                    fragile Hawaiian ecosystems are near extinction because of habitat              destruction, grazing introduced by herbivores and competition with              introduced plants.  Knowledge of factors promoting changes in plant             breeding systems has many potential breeding applications to                    practical problems in agriculture and forestry.  Inbreeding                     depression is well known to influence yield in many economically                important crop plants, such as corn.  Knowledge of factors causing              dioecy may lead to greater ability to manipulate sex ratios in                  plants and is of tremendous value where yield depends upon the                  production of fruit or seed by  the females as is the case of many              crop species.  Understanding the basis of unisexaulity will also be             important in production of hybrid strains, since female individuals             are easily hybridized without the necessity of time-consuming                   costly emasculation of hermaphroditic flowers.",
