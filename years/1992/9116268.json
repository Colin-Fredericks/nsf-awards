 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) will study dynamic and                     stochastic scheduling (allocation), synchronization                             (coordination), and concurrency aspects of communication systems,               especially those related to networking, multi-accessing, and                    service integration.  He will acquire a basic theoretical                       understanding of how these issues emerging at the level of                      elementary operations, affect the macroscopic performance of                    communication networks.  Based on that he will address the design               (synthesis) of efficient operational schemes (protocols,                        policies) for the optimization of networks with respect to                      criteria concerning throughput, message delays, blocking                        probabilities, fairness, load balancing, and reliability.                            In addition, the PI will create a unified framework                        emphasizing rigorous mathematics for studying basic prototypical                models, extracted from various practical situations involving                   scheduling and synchronization in communication networks.  New                  powerful queueing models will be developed to capture essential                 features of concurrency and synchronization, extending classical                queueing theory and allowing the systematic analysis of the                     dynamics and performance of protocols.  Real-time scheduling and                resource allocation schemes will be studied in a natural                        stochastic framework.   In cases where the relevant optimal                     scheduling algorithms are of high complexity, the focus will be                 on exploring simple (low complexity) scheduling schemes of                      operations to improve the performance.  Other aspects of dynamic                scheduling will also be examined, if necessary by simulation.",
