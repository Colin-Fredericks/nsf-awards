 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Dr. Walters will compare cellular mechanisms within             the same neurons contributing to 3 classes of long-lasting                      alteration.  These alterations, which have generally been                       considered separately in different biological preparations by                   different laboratories are: 1) adaptive responses following injury              of a neuron's axon, 2) hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons                 (functionally equivalent to neurons in mammalian pain pathways)                 during persistent nociceptive sensitization (\"hyperalgesia\"), and               3) aversive learning and memory.  Dr. Walters will be using                     electrophysiological, pharmacological, and morphological methods,               to characterize functionally identified neurons in an invertebrate              preparation to address the following questions:  First, does axonal             injury induce long-term changes in excitability, synaptic                       transmission, and morphology in functionally diverse neurons?                   Second, how do alterations induced by axonal injury compare to                  activity-dependent alterations that have previously been linked to              learning and memory.  In addition, how do injury-related and                    learning-related effects interact?  Third, is long-term plasticity              induced by axonal injury initially triggered by the interruption                of retrograde axonal transport of trophic factors, or do the axonal             triggers involve elevation within the axon of known signals for                 neuronal plasticity such as the second messengers calcium and cAMP?             Fourth, do cAMP and calcium in or near the cell body of the neuron              contribute to the triggering of long-term plasticity during both                learning and cellular reactions to axonal injury?  These                        investigations may reveal basic mechanisms of plasticity that                   appeared early in evolution and which may be involved in memory,                regeneration, and chronic pain-like states.***//",
