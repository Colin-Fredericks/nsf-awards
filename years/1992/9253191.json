 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project SEED is a four week summer workshop for middle                          school teachers that focuses on the use of inexpensive                          materials to teach the basic concepts and principles of                         physical science.                                                                                                                                               The core of the program is a manual of over 150 experiments                     and a kit of supporting demonstrations.  In addition to                         workshop sessions visits to local research and industrial                       facilities and talks by Northeastern University research                        faculty are included.                                                                                                                                           Teachers who have participated in SEED workshop will then                       receive two years of leadership training(PRO-SEED) to                           prepare them to conduct in-service activity based workshops                     in their own school districts. This after school program of                     \"teachers teaching teachers\" will be named EX-SEED.                                                                                                             An additional component of the project is to train retired                      scientists to act as Science Resource Agents(SRA'S) within                      the schools(RE-SEED)                                                                                                                                            Over the 46 months of funding 48 leader teachers, 16 peer                       teachers and 70 retired technical professionals will be                         taught.                                                                                                                                                         Additional features of the program involve the use of:                          * Live interactive telecasts distributed by Massachusett's                      Corporation for Educational Telecommunications(MCET)                            satellite network to EX-SEED leaders and participants prior                     to each EX-SEED workshop.                                                       * Museum-style corridor exhibits to be distributed within                       the schools for students.
