 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most chemical analyses of atmospheric particles are carried                out on bulk samples.  However, particle by particle variations in               composition strongly influence atmospheric transformations,                     visibility degradation, and the fate of particulate pollutants.  In             addition, knowledge of the microscopic mixing characteristics of                combustion products is essential to understanding particle                      formation in combustion.  With the development of computer-                     controlled scanning and x-ray detectors which measure elements as               light as carbon, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) has a great             deal of promise for this application.  However, more development                work is needed to assure that the elemental analysis accurately                 reflects the composition of the aerosol.                                                                                                                             The goal of this research is to obtain accurate single                     particle analyses of atmospheric aerosols with an electron                      microscope.  Monodisperse aerosols of known composition will be                 used to 1) conduct studies of electron beam damage to major                     components of atmospheric aerosols, 2) test methods to reduce beam              damage, and 3) validate existing quantitation methods.  The                     potential of the SEM for measuring carbon will also be assessed.                The techniques developed will be used in the future to identify the             elemental characteristics determining the uptake of water by                    aerosols.",
