 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports John C. Davis and several colleagues and                    students of the Energy Research Center of the University of Kansas              to collaborate in geological research with Jan Harff and others of              the Mathematical Geology Department of the Central Institute for                the Physics of the Earth, Potsdam, Germany.  The two groups have                been independently engaged in improving methods for regional                    geological modelling while working locally to model the North                   German depression and the Western Kansas shelf.  They are now                   combining their fundamentally different modelling approaches to                 produce a new and stronger modelling process, based on three-                   dimensional regionalization.   A further and more significant                   objective of their collaboration is to produce computer software,               running interactively on a graphical computer workstation, that can             easily be used for the regionalization and modeling of any                      sedimentary basin.                                                                                                                                              Three-dimensional regionalization is a quantitative process that                seeks to divide a sedimentary basin into discrete parts that are                simultaneously as homogeneous and distinct as possible in their                 characteristics, and also as geographically compact as possible.                The resulting subdivisions can then be treated as discrete entities,            greatly simplifying both static and dynamic modelling of the basin.             There is increasing need for improved methods of basin analysis in              order to locate energy and water resources and to predict fluid                 movement for environmental purposes.  Implementation of this                    greatly enhanced method of basin analysis in software operable in a             workstation environment will have a substantial impact beyond the               field of sedimentary geology.                                                                                                                                   A further contribution of this collaboration is that it links                   fundamental concepts of geostatistical theory with computer                     methodologies that have been developed relatively independently in              the Eastern bloc and in the West.  The valuable developments in                 this area of quantitative geology by scientists of the former socialist         countries of Europe and the USSR (including Dr. Harff and his                   group at Potsdam) are not widely known.  Basically, the \"eastern \"              approach focused on the discovery and description of discontinuous              aspects of geological structures and processes, while \"western\"                 researchers have tended to focus on the continuous aspect of                    geological properties.",
