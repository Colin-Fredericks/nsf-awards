 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with using aqueous biphasic salts                    composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and an inorganic salt to                  separate dissolved metal ions. When PEG and salt are added to                   water, the solution separates into two distinct layers; one                     phase is rich in PEG and the other in salt. Metal ions                          dissolved in this system preferentially dissolve in the PEG                     rich phase, and hence ion separation can be effected by simply                  dissolving polymer and salt in a metal-containing aqueous                       stream, and then separating the phases. The variables which                     affect the metal partitioning are the pH, salt selection, PEG                   concentration, temperature and distance from the critical                       point (i.e. the polymer/salt composition at which two phases                    first appear).                                                                                                                                                  Several critical areas are proposed for study:                                  (i) In previous research, the PI has demonstrated in a series                   of batch experiments, that technetium in the form of TcO4- can                  be extracted into the PEG rich phase using carbonate (K2CO3)                    and sulphate ((NH4)2SO4 without the need of a complexing                        agent. The PI intends to study this novel result further, and                   to build on this discovery by finding a method to strip the                     metal ions from the PEG-rich phase and complete the separation                  process. Several methods will be tested including ion                           exchange, and oil-water batch extraction with  the PEG as the                   aqueous phase.                                                                  (ii) Optimize particular biphasic systems (SO42-,CO32-, PO43- or                alkmaline media) for the selective removal of Tc or Cr (in the                  form of CrO41-).                                                                (iii) Base-Side extraction of alkali and alkaline earth metal                   ions from synthetic waste solutions of high alkalinity and                      high nitrate concentration.                                                     (iv) Biphasic systems for the removal of toxic metal cations                    using inorganic anions to form extractable complex anions of                    metals.                                                                         (v) Organic separations in biphasic systems                                     (vi) f-element extraction using a combination of aqueous                        biphase and water soluble extractant.",
