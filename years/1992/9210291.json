 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues surrounding the social security system in the U.S. have                  generated a large volume of academic research as well as wide                   public discussion.  When the system was first started, the main                 public policy objective was to provide funds for consumption                    during old age.  Since then, economists and policy makers have                  raised concerns over the adverse effect of social security on                   private saving, its negative impact on the labor supply, the                    incentive it creates for early retirement, and the overall impact               on the lifetime welfare of individuals.  The purpose of this                    research is to develop and calibrate a dynamic, stochastic                      general equilibrium model to address issues like these concerning               the social security system.  The focus will be to estimate the                  quantitative impact of the social security system on lifetime                   welfare and on the capital stock under lifetime uncertainty,                    liquidity constraints, and individual income risk.  Numerical                   methods will be used to solve a finite horizon, dynamic                         programming problem and to computed competitive equilibria of the               model.  This research will result in useful new insights about                  designing an optimal social security system.",
