 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to design, prove, and implement             efficient distributed algorithms to perform a variety of network                computations securely and with high fault-tolerance.  The security of           interactive and distributed computations is a natural and extremely             relevant issue to the current, highly interconnected world.                     Computations distributed among several interacting processors provide           greater reliability and security than centralized computations, which           are prone to failure and malicious attacks.  Large networks can employ          redundancy to correct errors, and it is easier to ensure - and more             reasonable to believe - that a majority of processors are correct than          that a particular processor remains absolutely invulnerable.  The goal          is to replace centralized computers (name servers or authentication             servers, for example) by fast, interactive computations that obviate            the need to trust a given host.                                                      The project will prove the protocols secure and fault-tolerant             using a new set of formal methods the researcher has developed to               define and prove security in distributed systems.  These formal                 methods capture intuition clearly, provide concise and modular proofs,          and have already been demonstrated useful in finding flaws in                   seemingly secure (and even published) protocols.                                     The project's standard of efficiency is stricter than just                 requiring polynomial or polylogarithmic upper bounds.  The researcher           is implementing the protocols to judge their efficiency, to                     demonstrate their utility, and to determine the factors that are                relevant in an applied setting.",
