The 200 kev Hitachi HF-2000 field emission,                   analytical transmission electron microcope to be installed at the               Microelectronics Research Center at Georgia Institute of Technology             is a cutting edge instrument that combines state-of-the-art high-               resolution capabilities with excellent analytical capabilities.                 Multidisciplinary materials research has emerged as a high-priority             area of emphasis of both research and education at Georgia                      Institute of Technology over the past decade.  Lack of such an                  instrument however has been a major limiting factor in the breadth              and depth of the current and planned materials research program.                Provision of this modern, research-grade TEM will facilitate the                conduct of major research studies on a broad range of materials                 systems and structures.  It will be made available throughout the               Institute and utilized at four different levels: (a) by long-term               professional microscopists responsible for operation, training, and             collaborative research with faculty PI's; (b) by long-term student              microscopists requiring TEM as a central part of their research;                (c) by short-term student users for educational as well as data                 acquisition purposes; and (d) as a service to provide essential                 research data to PI's and students.",
