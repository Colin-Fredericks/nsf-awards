 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now widely accepted that stress conditions lead to an                     increase in the frequencies of mutation measured by selection.  The             question now raised by the \"Directed mutation\" issue is the                     specificity of the changes induced by particular stress regimes. To             answer this question, it is necessary to characterize all DNA                   changes regardless of whether they facilitate growth under                      selective conditions.  This can now be done by PCR technology.  PCR             makes it possible to examine specific regions of the genome                     following stress and detect novel DNA structures, even if they can              not be selected by growth. Initial results demonstrated that a                  specific class of DNA rearrangement mediated by the Mu phage                    transposable element did not measurably occur under normal growth               conditions but were easily detectable at relatively high                        frequencies under selective conditions.  Use of PCR will now allow              detection of the frequency and time of occurance of such genetic                rearrangements with and without the selective techniques that are               usually required for measuring mutation rates.",
