 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported on a previous NSF grant has demonstrated that               the development of craniofacial systems in placental and                        marsupial mammals is characterized by large scale changes in                    relative rate and timing.  Specifically, the development of the                 central nervous system and skeletal system are both dramatically                slowed in metatherians relative to eutherians, however, the                     development of the muscular system is greatly accelerated.  These               results confirm hypotheses that suggest metatherians possess                    specific developmental adaptations to the requirements of their                 life history and suggest, somewhat surprisingly, that the                       development of craniofacial systems is quite plastic.  In the                   current project these results will be extended in two major                     directions.  First, craniofacial development will be examined in                other mammalian species to ask whether the variation is limited                 to characterizing the two largest mammalian groups, eutherians                  and metatherians.  Second, preliminary studies on the cellular                  and molecular bases of the developmental patterns observed will                 be initiated and the development of the nervous system will be                  examined in detail.                                                                  This study will combine comparative information with data on               gross, histological, cellular and molecular processes to allow an               integrated approach to craniofacial development.  The results                   obtained will address specific and significant problems  on                     mammalian biodiversity and provide opportunities to examine the                 mechanisms of and constraints on developmental patterns.",
