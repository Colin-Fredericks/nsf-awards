 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research project (with McPhail) on                the media coverage of demonstrations in Washington DC in 1982 and               1991.  Newspaper stories and television news have become a common               source of evidence for describing and interpreting the intensity,               duration and political content of public protest.  There is wide                suspicion, however, that media coverage of such events are a                    non-random selection of all demonstrations taking place.  It                    therefore becomes important to understand how media institutions                select from the vast range of actual events.  This study will                   compare data from the demonstration permit application records of               all police agencies that require protestors to obtain permits with              local and national print and electronic news stories about                      demonstrations.  The study will focus on demonstrations in                      Washington DC.                                                                        This study is important for two reasons.  It will improve our             understanding of how and what newspapers and television news select             to cover in the news, and it will provide researchers with much                 better knowledge about the potential bias of evidence based on                  newspaper and television sources.",
