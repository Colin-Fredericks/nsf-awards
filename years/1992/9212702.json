 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long term work in Dr. T. H. Dunnebacke's laboratory, provocative              but generally ignored, has shown that an agent from amoebae of                  Naegleria gruberi induces generations-delayed death of vertebrate               cells in culture, and that these dying cells in turn produce an                 agent that causes death of other vertebrate cells.  This remarkable             phenomenon has been confirmed, and it has been shown that the cell              death has features characteristic of apoptosis.  The first goal is              to complete and carefully document these new observations.                      Dunnebacke has purified the agent from amoebae, and has identified              it as a protein, which has been partially sequenced.  The plan, in              collaboration with Dunnebacke, is to use her information to clone               the Naegleria gene that encodes the protein, to sequence and                    characterize this gene and its product, and to determine whether                the isolated protein is responsible for the biological activity of              the agent.                                                                                                                                                      These studies should make this phenomenon a paradigm for future                 investigations of: 1, the mechanism by which a protein induces                  generations-delayed apoptosis; 2, how a protein from an amoeba can              lead to the production, by dying vertebrate cells, of a product                 with similar biological activity, as well as the nature of the                  vertebrate product; and 3, possible therapeutic applications of the             protein.",
