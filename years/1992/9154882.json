 "awd_abstract_narration": "McNeese State University will initiate a three-week, residential                Young Scholars project in Engineering for 20 students entering                  grades 10-12; the project will be repeated each year for a second               set of 20 students.  The program will take place in June and July               at McNeese State University and at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterway              Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi.                                                                                                                   At Vicksburg, a three-day coastal engineering workshop will                     introduce students to the theory and practice of coastal                        engineering.  At McNeese, studies will consist of field work,                   physical modeling and classroom instruction with field work taking              place at two beaches on the Gulf Coast, where students will survey              and measure beach profiles.  On campus, students will design, build             and test models of coastal protection systems in a large wave tank.             A physics laboratory course will reinforce concepts of velocity and             acceleration, densities of materials and behavior of waves.                     Classroom instruction will be given in coastal engineering, coastal             geology, computer applications, ethics of engineering, career                   counseling and technical writing.",
