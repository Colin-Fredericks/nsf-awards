Sources              of radiation (ionizing and nonionizing) affect all Americans, play              a significant role in many scientific and technological segments of             American society, and are ubiquitous in our natural environment.                The Director of the Office and Science and Technology Policy                    (OSTP), who is also the Chairman for FCCSET signed the Charter                  creating the CIRRPC in 1984. CIRRPC complements the radiation                   research and policy activities of the 18 federal member agencies.               Each agency contributes financial support to the operations of                  CIRRPC.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Current activities of CIRRPC include review of the literature on                the possible health risks to humans from exposure to low-frequency              electric and magnetic fields and coordination of radiation risk                 assessments and the review of radiation protection standards.",
