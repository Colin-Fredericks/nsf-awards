His co-hosts will be                                   Mr. Toshiaki Ohashi, AI Technology Department,                                  Computer and Communication Research Center and                                  Mr. Akira Maeda, Technology Research Group,                                     Research and Development Planning Department.                                   The research will include a study of the                                        techniques for evaluating the impact of demand                                  side management (DSM) in the Japanese Electric                                  Utility Industry.  They will be dealing with                                    the modeling of uncertainty related to demand                                   side management activities.  These                                              uncertainties originate from the unknown                                        customer response to the DSM programs, and                                      their willingness or unwillingness to maintain                                  interest in the program under less than ideal                                   conditions.  An attempt will be made to model                                   such uncertainty using the \"pairwise                                            comparison\" technique that Professor Rahman has                                 applied in other fields of electric power                                       engineering.  Once such quantitative measures                                   of uncertainty are available, they will be                                      applied to a generation expansion model to                                      examine the impacts of DSM on capacity needs.                                   A new technique to model the load duration                                      curve will be investigated which will                                           facilitate the representation of DSM impacts on                                 peak load, load factor and energy consumption.                                  This will provide an analytical method to study                                 the impact of DSM on capacity requirements.  In                                 the past, iterative methods have been applied                                   to study these impacts.  An analytical method                                   would result in faster solutions with higher                                    accuracy.                                                                                                                                                       The research has a comparative value and should                                 also provide a potential methodology with which                                 to evaluate DSM programs prior to their                                         initiation.  The research may also result in                                    useful analytical techniques that are                                           fundamentally different from presently used                                     demand management evaluation methods.                                           Professor Rahman is knowledgeable in a wide-                                    range of topics related to power systems                                        engineering.  He is well-published in the area                                  of power systems planning and is familiar with                                  the power industry in Japan.  TEPCO is the                                      largest electric utility in Japan, and it is                                    the largest privately owned power company in                                    the world.  It serves 22 million customers with                                 a peak demand of approximately 50,000 MW making                                 it an ideal utility in which to carry out                                       direct load control studies.  A successful                                      development of the proposed methodology could                                   be used to evaluate the impact of some new DSM                                  programs in the U.S. electric utility industry.                                 It is expected that this collaborative effort                                   between the researchers will continue even                                      after the formal agreement has terminated.  It                                  is also expected that a number of publications                                  will result from the project.",
