Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Enzyme-Substrate                          Complexes                                                                                                                                                   2.

Staffanes                                                                                                                                  4.  Studies of Cyclo and Linear Borophosphazane Oligomers and                       Polymers                                                                                                                                                    5.  Topological Stereochemistry and Design and Synthesis of New                     Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals                                               %%%                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the eludication of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in such areas as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
