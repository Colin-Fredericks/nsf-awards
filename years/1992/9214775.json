 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine goodness-of-fit tests for                       multivariate data modeled using distribution-free or                            nonparametric models.  The small sample behavior of test                        statistics based on spacings will be investigated using Monte                   Carlo methods and will be compared to limiting distribution                     theoretical results.  By constructing statistically equivalent                  blocks, test statistics can be extended to the multidimensional                 case.                                                                                When trying to represent an underlying explanatory or                      descriptive model for real multivariate data, a crucial                         difficulty is to determine when a postulated model is adequate.                 The fewer the mathematical assumptions made initially, the more                 difficult in general to be sure that the model does represent the               important features, but not any artifacts of a particular sample.               Some mathematical theory has been developed for the case of an                  arbitrarily large sample; some theory has been developed when the               data is assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.  This               project will examine tests of model adequacy when the samples are               not extremely large and at the same time the distribution cannot                be assumed to be normal.  The work will concentrate on multi-                   variate observations.",
