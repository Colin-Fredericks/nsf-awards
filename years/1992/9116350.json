 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanics of accretionary wedge growth along deep sea                       trenches is a fundamental problem in  plate tectonics. Although                 models exist which predict seafloor shape, sparse information                   exists on the geometry of deformation structures, strength of the               accreting sediments, or shear resistance along the base of the                  fault zone which controls underthrusting. It is well recognized                 that fluids play a crucial role in sediment accretion,                          deformation, diagenesis, and metamorphism in accretionary zones,                but study of fluid pathways and timing of dewatering have just                  begun. The importance of fluids in controlling the strength of                  rocks and shear resistance is recognized, but little data exists                to investigate these properties spatially or temporally.                                                                                                        The present project will conduct a high-resolution three-                       dimensional seismic reflection survey of the accretionary prism                 offshore Barbados in the zone of initial off-scraping,                          underplating and deformation of sediments. The objectives are to                characterize the structural geometries, and identify fluid                      pathways in the frontal part of the accretionary prism. The                     seismic data will be constrained by an extensive suite of other                 geophysical data, as well as the results of previous ocean                      drilling in the region. Results from this project will be used in               planning additional drilling in Barbados.",
