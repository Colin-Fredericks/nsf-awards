 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Museum of Connecticut (SMC) proposes a three-                       year exhibit project called The State of the Environment.                       This cost-effective project will serve over 500,000 citizens                    a year by producing two permanent exhibits - 2400 sf for SMC                    and 400 sf for SMD's Roaring Brook Nature Center -- and                         eight traveling exhibits for use primarily in connecticut's                     Priority schools.  These innovative exhibits use highly                         accurate sculptural relief maps which are animated by laser                     graphics and responsive to visitor inquiries through a                          research-calibre database containing vast information on                        Connecticut's environment.  Thorough evaluation will help                       SMC design visitor experiences that make map-database                           interaction attractive, easy to use and understand, and                         educationally satisfying.  State accredited teacher                             workshops will give educators a firm grasp of database                          capabilities prior to its use in the traveling exhibits for                     schools.  Traveling exhibits will support goals in                              Connecticut's NSF-funded Statewide Initiative.  Teacher's                       Guides will facilitate in-dept investigations for high                          school science lessons.  These exhibits will provide hands-                     on experiences with professional tools for environmental                        research, show how environmental maps are made, teach basic                     principles of environmental science, and provide-in-depth                       information about the ecology of an entire state.",
