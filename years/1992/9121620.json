 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal MAX '91 plans to study solar activity during the                   period of solar maximum 91-94 with emphasis on coordination of                  observations from existing facilities, as well as from new                      balloon, rocket and ground-based instrumentation.  Alan                         Kiplinger has acted in the capacity of Max '91 Coordinator and                  has conducted three major worldwide campaigns in the last few                   years.  He supported several rocket flights, and set up a near-                 real-time solar computer data base at NOAA's Space Environment                  Laboratory.  The investigator proposes to continue to carry out                 coordination of the Max '91 program during the remainder of solar               maximum by operationally supporting several new major campaigns,                rocket and balloon flights and \"target of opportunity\" campaigns.               This support includes distributions of Campaign Announcements                   with planning information,as well as Campaign Summaries which                   provide plots and lists of solar activity and compilations                      observations conducted worldwide.  The Coordinator also proposes                to continue to develop new products and data bases which can be                 used by and distributed to the scientific community.  An example                is development of a digital archival system to capture  5,500                   digital images per day from the five fulltime U.S.A.F. SOON                     observatories located around the world.  These data should become               a significant cornerstone of observations for studies of flares                 triggering, flare build-up and energetics, as well as active                    region evolution.                                                               A vigorous pursuit of independent research by the Coordinator has               proven to be beneficial to Max '91 as well as to his long-term                  research goals.  Accordingly, a variety of studies with the High                Speed Ho Camera system also are proposed.  These studies include                new observations of impulsive flares in pursuit of electron time                of flight effects.  Other proposed studies include optical                      observations of formations of active filaments, microwave spike                 bursts and an upgrade of the system to obtain measurements of                   linear polarization in flares with a temporal resolution of 0.4s.",
