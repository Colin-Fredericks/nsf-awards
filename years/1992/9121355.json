 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation focuses on  diel vertical migration by                  salps (pelagic tunicates) in the vicinity of the Bermuda Atlantic               Time Series Station.  Salps are efficient grazers on                            phytoplankton and other particulates; they are widely distributed               and sometimes occur in dense populations.  Several species                      migrate vertically, some as far as 800 m, while others are                      restricted to surface waters.  Recent work in the Subarctic                     Pacific and near Bermuda has revealed intriguing new features to                these migrations, which do not seem consistent with traditional                 theories for the advantages of migration.  Salps in the Pacific                 make shallow migrations, but stop feeding while at the surface                  during the night.  This behavior is believed to relate mainly to                spawning and fertilization.  Recently salps have been observed                  to consistently appeared at the surface at different times of day               - morning, afternoon and night.  This apparent migration is also                inconsistent with the usual explanations.                                            Dr. Miller and collaborators will investigate the behavior                 of this extremely important group of pelagic herbivores.  They                  will test two, non-exclusive  hypotheses for the migratory                      patterns observed:  1) migration optimizes feeding at food-rich                 depths, or temporally partitions food among spatially co-                       occurring species; 2) migration concentrates salps at the                       surface and synchronizes spawning and fertilization.  The                       investigations address basic questions of adaptation and ecology                in migrating zooplankton, reproductive physiology of salps, and                 competition and niche separation.  They are also critical for                   calculations of the role of grazing and migration by salps on                   vertical fluxes of particulate and dissolved nutrients.",
