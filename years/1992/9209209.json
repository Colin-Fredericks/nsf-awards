 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of the project is to develop multilayer composite               coatings on carbide tool inserts for high speed machining of steel              and cast iron.  Nonequilibrium processing using laser physical                  vapor deposition will be employed.  A multitarget, high vacuum                  chamber with facilities to maintain selective environment and in-               situ process the coatings has been designed and constructed.                    Titanium carbide will be deposited on tungsten carbide tool insert              to form and initial adherent coating.  Multilayer composite                     coatings will be developed.  Laser parameters, thickness and number             of the layers of the coatings will be optimized to achieve high                 quality coatings.  The coatings will be characterized using modern              analytical techniques to determine second phase formation,                      interdiffusion, segregation, and epitaxial nature of the interface.             Mechanical properties of the coatings will be evaluated.  The                   coated tools will be tested in high speed machining to determine                the wear and failure mechanisms.                                                     The project should lead to the development of coatings for                 cutting tools with improved wear resistance which should allow                  increased productivity in machining.",
