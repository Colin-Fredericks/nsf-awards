 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS) on                behalf of its member institutions, proposes to establish an IHETS               Data Network.  The proposal requests partial funding for                        participation in NSFNET through a connection with CICNET, the                   regional network attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as             partial start-up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and                 operating support to facilitate the fullest possible participation.             The educational institutions that will participate include:                     Anderson University, Ball State Univ., Butler Univ., DePauw Univ.,              Earlham College, Franklin College, Hanover College, Manchester                  College, St. Joseph College, Taylor Univ., Univ. of Evansville,                 Univ. of Indianapolis, Univ. of Southern Indiana, Valparaiso Univ.,             Vincennes Univ., Vincennes Univ., and Wabash College.  The network              will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access              for a broad variety of entities engaged in education and research.              This cooperative network will provide gateways to regional,                     national, and international networks and will be consistent with                their standards.  It will further the institutions' work in                     enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated              workforce, accessible training opportunities, and research and                  development partnerships.  Another goal of the network is to                    facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between              institutions, including those outside the state.  The universities              need greater functionality and network speed to be able to access               supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being             able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty             research will benefit from the link.  This is also a unique                     opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational                   resources.",
