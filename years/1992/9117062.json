Arockiasamy,                         Department of Ocean Engineering, Florida Atlantic                               University, to pursue with Dr. N. E. Shanmugam,                                 Department of Civil Engineering, National University of                         Singapore, for a period of 24 months, research on the                           behavior of stiffened steel plates subjected to the                             combined action of in-plane and lateral loading in                              offshore structures.  Simplified methods will be                                developed for predicting the behavior of ultimate load                          carrying capacity of stiffened plates supported in the                          longitudinal direction or both in the longitudinal and                          transverse directions.  Orthotropic plates will be                              analyzed using the energy method with an approximate                            deflection function.  The effects of parameters such as                         plate width to thickness ratio, flexural and torsional                          properties of stiffeners, aspect ratio of stiffened                             plates, and the relative magnitudes of lateral and in-                          plane load on the behavior of stiffened plates also                             will be studied.                                                                                                                                                The proposed analytical and experimental investigations                         will lead to a greater understanding of the behavior of                         stiffened plates under various load conditions and will                         contribute to the formulation of improved design                                recommendations for offshore structures.  These                                 recommendations, based on experimental and analytical                           work, will replace the empirical formulae currently                             being used for stiffened plates commonly adopted in                             ship and offshore structures.  This project will                                provide for the PI access to ongoing research at the                            National University of Singapore, where the                                     experimental research will be done.  Both collaborators                         will be engaged in the analytical investigations which                          will be carried out at Florida Atlantic University.                             The collaborators are highly respected engineers who                            have published extensively in the field of the                                  research.  The present project will allow them to                               combine their talents and the resources of their                                respective laboratories in cooperative research on a                            problem of mutual interest and potential benefit to the                         United States and Singapore.  This project is relevant                          to the objectives of the Science in Developing                                  Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of                          cooperation between U.S. and developing country                                 scientists and engineers through the exchange of                                scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques                           and through collaboration on problems of mutual                                 benefit.",
