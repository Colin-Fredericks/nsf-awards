 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is               in the general area of Computational Chemistry.  Global                         optimization plays a key role in molecular computations in                      computational chemistry.  Due to the large size of even modest                  molecules, these methods must contend with countless local minima.              Clever algorithms have been developed that sample parameter space               to reduce trapping in local minima, but these fail by providing                 statistical rather than guaranteed solutions.                                                                                                                   There is a class of algorithms that for certain functions                       guarantee that a global minimum has been found.  These methods                  achieve this remarkable result using interval arithmetic.                       Interval global optimization has been known for some time, but has              never been applied to systems as large as those encountered in                  computational chemistry.                                                                                                                                        This project will identify how to modify the functions encountered              in computational chemistry such that interval global analysis                   applies.  It will also explore the parallel programming techniques              necessary to scale the calculations up to the huge sizes demanded               by molecular mechanics calculations.",
