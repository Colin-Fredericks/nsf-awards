Conventional FLCs readily form low-                                             light-loss polar films in a wide                                                range of thicknesses, and have been                                             demonstrated as optical waveguides.                                             The new X(2) FLCs combine the                                                   processibility of conventional FLCs                                             with thermodynamically stable NLO                                               susceptibility of useful magnitude.

Key questions                                            which will be answered in this work                                             include the following: 1) What is                                               the intrinsic director structure in                                             the capillary tubes--is the                                                     polarization vector field polar, and                                            how can it be controlled? 2) What                                               are possible phase matching schemes                                             for FLC-cored optical waveguides?                                                                                                                               FLC alignment in capillary tubes                                                will be examined experimentally, and                                            the effect of FLC material                                                      parameters such as liquid crystal                                               phase sequence, helix pitch, tilt                                               angle, and capillary tube                                                       preparation on alignment                                                        characteristics will be determined.                                             Using director alignment                                                        information, second harmonic                                                    generation processes will be                                                    accurately modeled by solving the                                               wave equation with position                                                     dependent relative permittivity and                                             nonlinear polarizability.
