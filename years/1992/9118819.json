 "awd_abstract_narration": "When animals eat, digest and assimilate a protein-containing meal,              nitrogen atoms in the form of ammonia are produced as waste.                    Ammonia is a very potent toxin to the central nervous system, so                it must be rapidly removed from their bodies.  In fish and other                water-dwelling animals, the surrounding water is a virtually                    limitless sink for this ammonia, so nitrogen waste is simply and                rapidly removed to the water as ammonia.  Land-dwelling animals,                however, not being immersed in water, have the need to conserve                 water, so they cannot readily remove ammonia as such.  They                     transform ammonia to urea, which since it is less toxic to the                  central nervous system, can be stored in higher concentrations                  before being eliminated in a concentrated urine which conserves                 water.  Transforming ammonia to urea diverts energy from other                  bodily functions (e.g., growth, reproduction, etc.), so in an                   evolutionary sense making urea is not a trivial investment.  We                 have discovered a higher teleost (bony) marine fish, the gulf                   toadfish, that unexpectedly makes and excretes urea.  This grant                will allow us to study why and how this phenomenon occurs and its               ecological and evolutionary significance.  In addition to enhancing             our basic knowledge in this area of physiology processes, these                 studies may at some point provide information useful to practical               developments in aquaculture and environmental management.",
