 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the integration of source coding,                  channel coding, and modulation.  The first part of the problem is               to map the samples of the source into a code that minimizes the                 distortion and tries to maximize the minimum distance between                   code words.  The second part of the problem is to find a suitable               modulation scheme that is matched to the code and uses the                      bandwidth efficiently.  Performance measures that reflect the                   performance of an overall system are developed.  The performance                of combined source and channel code using permutation codes,                    which have been used independently for source coding and for                    channel coding, will be considered.  Initially permutation                      modulation is considered in the design and analysis of the                      combined system.  Next two approaches are considered for coded                  modulation: signal sets derived from generalized (optimal                       constant weight codes), and the use of combinatorial and                        geometric structures to generate signal sets enabling the                       realization of multi-dimensional modulation schemes through                     frequency, phase, and amplitude shift keying, or combinations.",
