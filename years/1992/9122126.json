 "awd_abstract_narration": "A set of seven proposals and two supplement requests was                   submitted for participation in an international marine atmospheric              chemistry experiment.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition in the             eastern North Atlantic during June 1992, is a multinational effort              designed to improve our capability for studying cloud-chemistry                 interactions and the air/sea fluxes that affect them.  The specific             goals of the MAGE atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX                     include:  1) develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying                chemical and meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using                ships, balloons, and aircraft; 2) develop and test new techniques               for estimating trace-gas and aerosol fluxes across the air/sea                  interface by comparison with traditional approaches; 3) evaluate                the impact of marine and continental aerosols and the formation and             dissipation of stratocumulus clouds; 4) compare the impacts of                  natural and anthropogenic sulfur, halogens, and hydrocarbons on                 marine aerosol chemistry; and 5) use a multinational, multi-agency              field experiment as a means for addressing tropospheric chemistry               issues.                                                                                                                                                              In this MAGE proposal, the PIs plan to conduct measurements of             SO2 and DMS and measurements of DMS fluxes from the ocean surface               to the atmosphere, and to investigate the sources of cloud                      condensation nuclei in the cloud-topped marine boundary layer and               cloud condensation nucleus production associated with marine                    clouds.  The proposed measurements will be obtained from the                    University of Washington Convair C-131 research aircraft, and the               proposed studies will be closely coordinated with simultaneous                  studies (involving shipboard, ground-based, and airborne                        measurements) of ocean-atmosphere interactions to be carried out as             part of the multi-agency ASTEX program.",
