 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor John R. Sabin of the                              University of Florida and several of his graduate                               students to collaborate in theoretical materials research                       with Professor Jens Oddershede of the Chemistry                                 Department of the Odense University, Denmark.  Both                             research groups are highly productive and recognized for                        their expertise in quantum chemistry.  They share an                            interest in understanding the physical process of energy                        deposition in matter by swift, massive particles.  The                          Florida group offers strengths in the theoretical aspects                       of this question, while the group in Denmark has                                particular strengths in the experimental and theoretical                        aspects.  They propose a series of theoretical and                              numerical studies related to molecular stopping in                              several systems.  In particular, they will investigate                          the moments of oscillator strength distributions in small                       molecules, and also apply a less rigorous approach to                           calculate stopping cross sections in larger systems.  In                        both cases, a good deal of experimental data exists that                        has not been examined for theoretical significance.                                                                                                             The interaction of swift, massive particles with matter                         is a field with implications for such diverse studies as                        detector design and dosimetry, target design for the                            light ion beam fusion program, radiation therapy in                             medicine and ion beam implantation of impurities in                             solids.  The proposed collaborative work will be the                            first consistent theoretical study of energy deposition                         processes in molecules.",
