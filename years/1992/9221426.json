 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is proposed under the Small Grants for Exploratory                Research program and focusses on the environmental and cultural                 determinants of human fertility.  It is becoming increasingly                   apparent that many variables such as subsistence behavior greatly               affect fertility and demography and that cross-cultural studies are             of major significance in teasing apart the factors involved.  The               primary objective is to assess the feasibility of a full scale                  project concerning the reproductive ecology of three native groups              in South India.  The three groups involved would allow the                      comparison of groups living in the same physical environment but                practicing different subsistence patterns as well as the responses              to culture change. The investigator needs to assess the verbal and              written reports as to the subsistence adaptations in these                      populations and to verify that these three groups will allow the                appropriate comparisons.",
