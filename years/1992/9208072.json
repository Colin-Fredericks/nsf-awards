 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue to study the dependence of                  topological invariants of the complement of a union of hyperplanes              in complex n-space on the combinatorial structure of the associated             arrangement.  Invariants to be studied include the homology of the              universal abelian cover, the higher homotopy groups, the homology               of the Milnor fiber, and the cohomology ring.  These will be                    described in terms of the underlying matroid, the oriented matroid              and its generalization to non-real arrangements, and the bounded                complex.  The results will be applied to unsolved problems                      concerning the matroid stratification of the Grassmannian, the                  homology classification of hyperplane complements in terms of                   combinatorial invariants, the combinatorial structure of free                   arrangements, and the factorization properties of the Orlik-Solomon             algebra.  The initial focus of this research will be on                         complexified arrangements in dimension three.  The main topological             tool is the 2-complex model T of the universal cover constructed by             the investigator.  The structure of T is determined in a simple way             by the complex of bounded faces of the real part of the                         arrangement.  On the one hand, this facilitates a geometric                     analysis of the second homotopy group.  At the same time, this                  universal cover complex yields an algebraic description of the                  homology of abelian covers in terms of modules over polynomial                  rings.  The study of free arrangements will center on the various               notions of formality introduced by the investigator and his co-                 workers.                                                                             The complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes in n-space is              just the collection of chunks into which n-space falls when cleaved             by a number of (n-1)-spaces.  This seemingly innocuous structure                has called forth a surprising amount of heavy machinery from                    various parts of algebra and topology and led to some gratifyingly              attractive analysis and general combinatorial principles.  Although             the work is theoretical and leads to rigorous proofs, at                        intermediate stages it is useful to experiment and test examples.               Some machine computation is indispensable at this point,                        particularly using such symbolic manipulators as Cayley, for which              a Sun SPARCstation is available to the investigator.",
