 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one day workshop on USA/German Collaboration in Research and                  Education:  Chemical Engineering, is proposed to be held in                     conjunction with the 1992 Spring meeting of the American                        Institute of Chemical Engineers in New Orleans.  The workshop                   is in conjunction with a similar workshop proposed by                           Professor Fletcher of Texas A&M mechanical engineering.  The                    goals of the workshop are to survey existing academic chemical                  engineering programs and to catalyze a dialog among members of                  the US chemical engineering academic community directed toward                  documenting existing mechanisms for US/German student                           exchanges in cooperative education and research, while                          obtaining input from the involved community regarding                           impediments to collaborative German/US exchanges.  The                          workshop will initiate an exploration of new methods for                        enhancing collaborative projects.  The products to this                         workshop and accompanying final report will include:  A                         catalog of current US/German interactions; a tabulation of                      current successful and ideal models for US/German academic                      cooperation; identification of structural impediments and                       possible solutions to cooperation; plans for encouragement and                  implementation of US/German cooperation.  The report of this                    workshop will be widely distributed.                                                                                                                            It is the intent of the workshop to sensitize participants and                  readers of the final report to the international nature of                      chemical engineering so that of chemical engineering programs                   throughout the United States will be encouraged to participate                  in exchange programs to develop the cultural skills necessary                   to interact well with German trained engineers throughout the                   world.  The German University education and research system                     emphasizes close collaboration with industry.  US students and                  faculty will gain insight into the German view of engineering                   and may be better able to help their US companies to be                         competitive in foreign markets.  These students should be able                  to work more effectively for US companies overseas, or (in the                  US) for German companies with subsidiaries in the US, and feel                  equally comfortable in these different environments.",
