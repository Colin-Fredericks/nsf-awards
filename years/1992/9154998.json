This summer program consists of course work and field trips which               will integrate marine science, mathematics and computer science.                The Great Bay Estuary and the Isle of Shoals will be the sites of               field trips on which participants will perform a variety of                     measurements to contrast and compare fresh water, salt marsh, mud               flat and rocky coast environments.  The measurements by each                    student will be intercompared and also compared to baseline data.               Participants will be taught the computer and mathematical tools                 necessary to take and analyze data and to make valid                            interpretations.  The investigation will be motivated by ecological             problems in the area.  Students will live part of the time with                 faculty in mathematics and science.  There will be four one-day                 workshops during the academic year, one of which will be a one-day              mini-experience for 75 students who were not chosen for the summer              program.",
