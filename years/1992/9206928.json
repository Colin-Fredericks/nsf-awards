 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators undertake research in three areas of                     approximation theory: wavelet analysis, multivariate splines and                wavelets, and radial basis functions.  In the study of wavelets,                beyond the mathematical analysis a major focus is on applications               to real-time (or on-line) time-frequency analysis.  Hence the                   investigators study the analysis and algorithmic and                            computational aspects of spline-wavelets and non-orthogonal                     wavelet packets.  In particular, they will design a                             predictor-corrector algorithm along the line of the Kalman filter               to implement the spline-wavelet decomposition without truncation                and to take care of noise processes such as white noise.  The                   research on multivariate splines also extends to the construction               of multivariate wavelets using box splines.  One of the most                    difficult problems is the study of minimum supports that give                   rise to reconstruction sequences with minimum length.  Again a                  predictor-corrector algorithm will be implemented to avoid                      truncation of the decomposition sequences. \"Radial basis                        functions\" is a tool that allows fiting both regular and                        scattered data by continuously differentiable functions. Certain                matrices associated with interpolation and approximation                        processes arise in connection with the data fitting.  The                       investigators will study the \"stability\" of these matrices.  They               also consider various aspects of the question of how rapidly the                approximating surfaces approach the underlying surface from which               the scattered data are sampled as the number of data points                     increases.                                                                           The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or                       functions as well as their spectra into different frequency                     components and then studies each component with a resolution                    matched to the appropriate scale.  For example, given a signal,                 one is interested in \"cutting\" up its frequency content with                    local time-information.  This is similar to music notation, which               tells the player which notes to play at any given moment.                       Wavelets, wavelet transforms, and wavelet packets help in                       analyzing signals and data.  Wavelet analysis is useful in data                 reduction, which already has been applied to high-definition T.V.               Using wavelets, the investigators aim at decomposing and                        reconstructing signals as simply and accurately as possible.                    Another aim is to represent the underlying processes generating                 scattered data by means of \"simple\" radial functions.  This                     allows one to analyze and extrapolate data, which is important                  for artificial learning devices.",
