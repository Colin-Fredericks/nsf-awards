 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many coastal species, a critical platonic larval stage is               spent in the waters of the inner continental shelf, the most                    shoreward few kilometers of the shelf where depths are typically                less than 30 m.  Our knowledge of the parameters of the shelf                   where these planktonic larvae live is meager.  Physical processes               which strongly influence the biology, such as sediment transport                and the stratification and circulation of inner shelf waters, are               poorly understood.  A major goal of this study is to obtain                     synoptic, moored, long-term measurements of biological, physical                and sediment transport parameters at the same time and space                    scales.  The field program is aimed at gaining insight into the                 processes that may control the successful dispersal and                         settlement of planktonic larvae of organisms living in near-shore               sandy sediments.  The study is designed so that critical                        disciplinary, as well as interdisciplinary questions can be                     addressed.  The basic hypothesis guiding the research is that                   planktonic larvae of organisms living in the intertidal zone (or                in very shallow water) exploit the circulation of the inner shelf               to control their cross-shelf transport.",
