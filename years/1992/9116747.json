 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor Michael Cusanovich,                          Department of Biochemistry and Vice President for Research,                     University of Arizona, and Professor Hideo Akutsu, Department of                Physical Chemistry, Yokohama National University.  The project is               a multidisciplinary approach to elucidating in molecular terms the              properties of cytochromes c3 in order to understand its unique                  electrical properties.  A major goal will be to use studies on                  electron transfer in solution to understand the electrical properties           of cytochrome c3 adsorbed on metal substrates and in films.  New                insights into intramolecular electron transfer will be obtained.  It is         anticipated that these studies will develop possible applications of            cytochrome c3 as a bioelectronic device.                                                                                                                        In this collaboration, the U.S. group, which also includes Professor            G.S. Wilson of the University of Kansas and Professor Therese                   Cotton of Iowa State University, will focus on the solution                     properties of cytochrome c3 (redox and ligand binding kinetics),                site-directed mutagenesis, electrochemical characterization of the c-           type cytochromes on electrode surfaces and in films and SERS                    studies of orientation of cytochromes on solid surfaces.  The                   Japanese group will measure microscopic and macroscopic redox                   potentials, the properties of c-type cytochromes adsorbed on                    electrodes, site-directed mutagenesis, NMR analysis and x-ray                   crystallography of cytochromes c3.",
