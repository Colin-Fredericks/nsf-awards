 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins r-protein) is                    translationally regulated during the differentiation of mouse                   myoblasts into fibers and in a wide variety of other organisms                  and cell types.  Elucidation of the mechanisms controlling r-                   protein synthesis will greatly enhance our understanding of                     eukaryotic ribosome formation and add to our knowledge of                       eukaryotic translational control.   The translational                           regulation of r-protein synthesis is due to the interaction of                  factors with structural motifs within the 5'untranslated region                 of r-protein nRNAs.  A major aim of this proposal is to                         determine the secondary structure of the 5'end of purified L32                  and S16 r-protein mRNAs and determine the structure of these                    same mRNAs when they are assembled into 45S subpolysomal mRNP                   or polysomes.  This will be accomplished using chemical and                     enzymic Probes specific to single or double stranded RNA and                    crosslinking agents.  If similar secondary structures are                       detected in L32 and S16 r-protein mRNA, their importance for                    translation will be evaluated by making compensating and                        noncompensating changes in the stem sequence and then assaying                  the effect of these changes on translation.  Another major aim                  is to identify and characterize the factors binding to the 5'                   end of r-protein mRNAs as these may regulate the translation of                 r-protein mRNA.  It will be determined whether these factors                    are different from factors binding to the 5' end of efficiently                 translated mRNAs and determine whether their activity changes                   during myoblast differentiation.   This will be addressed using                 gel mobility shift and UV crosslinking techniques.  The last                    major aim is to isolate and characterize the S16 45S sub                        polysomal mRNP using centrifugation, gel electrophoresis and                    biotin-strepavidin chromatography, and to determine the RNA and                 protein composition of this subpolysomal mRNP  Analysis of the                  structure of this mRNP should determine if the 45S subpolysomal                 mRNP is a storage particle or an intermediate in the                            translation initiation pathway.                                                 %%%                                                                             Ribosomes translate mRNA into protein and therefore play a                      central role in cellular metabolism.  The ribosome content of                   eukaryotic cells is therefore highly controlled to insure that                  cells have a sufficient number of ribosome to support growth                    and development.  The proposed experiments should enhance our                   understanding of eukaryotic ribosome formatioin and control of                  translation.",
