 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for instrumentation t perform                                measurements of fluorescent lifetimes using both the                            established technique single photon counting (SPU) and a new                    and novel method which we termed 'Time-Resolved Fluorescence                    Lifetime Imaging' (TRFLI).  The system consists of a                            Ultrafast CW Nd: YAG pumped dye laser and a mode-locker,                        second and third harmonic generator units; an inverted epi-                     fluorescence microscope with infinity-corrected optic;                          microchannel-plate photomultipler tube; high-speed, gated                       image intensifier coupled fiberoptically to an integrating                      CCD camera, with necessary control units; digital delay                         pulse generator, delay units,  time-to-amplitude converter                      with bias amplifier and multichannel analyzer; and on-stage                     specimen controllers for temperature and atmospheric gases                      (  O 2 & CO2).  The requested laser has a minimum 1.3 ps                        pulse width, a repetition rate of  76 MHz and usable                            excitation wavelengths from 350-846 nm.                                                                                                                         Primary uses of this system will be to measure fluorescent                      lifetimes in living cells of fluorophores or fluorophore                        conjugated cellular components on the living cells.  This                       information will then be used to determine with temporal and                    spatial resolution molecular interactions amongst cellular                      constituents, using resonance energy transfer and time                          resolved emission spectra, monitor membrane lipid order                         (fluidity) using time resolved emission anisotropy,                             detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical specimens and                     measurement of cytosolic free Ca2+ using Fura-2, Fluo-3, or                     Rhod-2 lifetime analysis.  The use of Fluo-3 or Rhod-2  will                    also allow the use of caged compounds and laser scanning                        confocal microscopy.  The TRFLI System will be a unique                         instrument integrating state-of-the-art advances in optical                     microscopy, low-light video detection and 2-dimensional                         lifetime image analysis and which does not exit anywhere                        else in the country.",
