 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project, sponsored by Beaver College, will                      provide a four week summer programs for thirty teachers each                    year to learn the basic science concepts of modern psychology.                  Topics will include psychology, sensation, perception,                          learning, memory and cognition.  In the project teachers will                   learn how to set up laboratory experiments, carry out                           classroom demonstrations and learn statistical principles to                    illustrate psychology concepts to their students.  By the end                   of the summer the teachers will have developed lesson plans in                  each topic area and will be given curriculum materials which                    can be used upon returning to the schools.  the follow-up                       portion of the project includes presentation of teaching                        modules at regional workshops and classroom visits by project                   staff to aid in the implementation of the new materials into                    the classroom.
