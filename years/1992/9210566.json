 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a study of variable surface proteins of                 Neisseria. The investigator has identified proteins called pilins,              which are different in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. These             proteins show antigenic and phase-specific differences, which will              be studied further. Clones have been isolated, and the genes will               be investigated. Undergraduates will be involved, and a RUI                     application is anticipated.                                                     %%%                                                                             This proposal is to study differences between surface proteins                  called pilins on pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of the                   bacterium Neisseria. The genes for these proteins appear to be                  expressed at variable times during the bacterial life cycle; this               will be further investigated why the proteins differ between the                pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.",
