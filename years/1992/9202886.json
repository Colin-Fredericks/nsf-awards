 "awd_abstract_narration": "This focuses on the development of procedures which integrate                   modern dynamical systems theory and analytical/numerical                        techniques to characterize the dynamical behavior of systems with               strong local nonlinearities. The emphasis will be placed on                     nonlinearly coupled rotor/structural systems such as high speed                 aircraft engines. Strong local nonlinearities in rotor systems                  are manifested in dampers, clearances, fluid interactions, rubs,                and others. The systems may be subjected to single or multi                     frequency excitation due to rotating imbalance in single, or                    multiple shaft and/or geared systems, respectively. General                     procedures will be developed for determining the system's                       multiple, periodic and quasi-periodic responses, their detailed                 bifurcations and routes to chaos.  Low order rotor models will be               constructed to study the nonlinear mechanisms by which the                      regular and chaotic behavior of the systems influence their                     performance. Of particular interest is the effect of internal                   resonances on that behavior. The research will yield reliable                   methods and procedures which will contribute to the fundamental                 understanding of nonlinear phenomena in systems with strong                     nonlinearities. The methods will be generalized to efficiently                  treat large order rotor systems to aid in their simulation,                     design, testing and monitoring; and for future developments in                  experimental and analytical studies.*** //",
