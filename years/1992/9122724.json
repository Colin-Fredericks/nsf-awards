 "awd_abstract_narration": "Institutional investors now hold over half of US equities,                 and most of this money is managed by professional money managers.               Although progressively more of that money is put into index funds               -- a strategy suggested by standard finance models -- the                       majority is still managed actively.  That is, money managers                    allocate money between stocks and bonds, and choose individual                  securities within both groups.  Despite the important role played               by professional money managers in financial markets, there has                  been relatively little research on money management so far,                     particularly on institutional money management.  This project                   studies the behavior of institutional investors and the impact of               their trading on stock prices using three data sets.  The first                 data set covers 769 pension funds and gives their quarterly                     portfolio holdings over 1985-1989.  The second data set covers 37               very large money management firms and gives their daily trades                  during 1986-1988.  The third data set covers 143 open end mutual                funds and gives their annual performance during 1965-1984.                                                                                                           The project addresses empirically the following broad                      questions:                                                                      1.  How prevalent are particular types of investment strategies                 among institutional money mangers?  Are managers consistent over                time in following a particular strategy?                                        2.  What is the nature of the agency relationship between fund                  sponsors and managers, and how does it affect the trading                       strategies of the funds?  In particular what is the role of the                 trading horizon, of the compensation arrangements, and of                       relative performance evaluation?                                                3.  How does excess demand by institutions affect stock prices?                 Do institutions herd?  Based on the strategies they follow and                  their herding tendencies, are institutions likely to have a                     destabilizing influence on stock prices in the sense of moving                  them away from fundamental values?",
