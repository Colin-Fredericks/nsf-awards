 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulatory mechanisms utilized for the control of                      expression of the rudimentary gene of Drosophila melanogaster will              be examined with a combination of genetic and molecular approaches.             The underlying hypothesis is that there exist a number of trans-                acting regulatory genes which interact with the rudimentary gene to             produce the developmental program of gene expression. The tissue-               specific control regions within the 5'end of the rudimentary gene               will be more precisely mapped and characterized. Fusion proteins                will be isolated and used to generate antibodies to the wild-type               mod(r)1 and mod(r)2 proteins. These antibodies will be used to                  determine the tissue distribution and the cellular localization of              the wild-type proteins. Additionally, the antibodies will be used               for the characterization and purification of the gene products.                 Lastly, the null phenotypes and normal functions of mod(r)1 and                 mod(r)2 will be determined. Mutants which have deficiencies and                 have a null phenotype will be isolated and characterized. cDNA's                will continue to be isolated and sequenced in an effort to                      determine the biological function of these genes.                               %%%                                                                             An understanding of the many ways in which genes are regulated so               that the precise developmental pattern of a living organism almost              invariably occurs is critical to our insight into life processes.",
