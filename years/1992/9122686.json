 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines a class of social dilemmas in which groups                of players are asked to share a resource pool whose size is not                 known.  Rather, the size is sampled randomly from a probability                 distribution which is common knowledge.  Each member of the group               requests a share of the resource; individual requests are granted               only if the total group request does not exceed x.  Experimental                evidence shows that as the uncertainty about the resource size                  increases, people increase their requests thereby increasing the                probability that their requests will be denied.                                                                                                                 Six experiments will be conducted to study several variables of                 interest in such situations including the amount of uncertainty                 about the resource, the number of iterations (possible requests                 from one individual), the value of public and secret information,               and speed of feedback concerning individual requests.  Several                  situation protocols will be considered.  Under one protocol                     requests are made independently and simultaneously, under a                     second protocol requests are made sequentially, and under third                 protocol only chronological information is provided.  The                       experiments are driven by game theoretical models describing                    equilibrium solutions and psychological models involving the                    concept of focal points.                                                                                                                                        This award is to be supplemented under the Research Experiences for             Undergraduates (REU) Program.  This project provides a variety of               excellent research opportunities for for undergraduate students.                There are several components of the research where undergraduates               have an opportunity to contribute to the project and to work                    closely with the principal investigator.  Specifically, two                     undergraduate students will be supported.  These students will be               involved in design, conduct, and analysis of a series of                        experiments.  The integration of students into all phases of the                project should be of significant benefit to the students as they                plan career goals.",
