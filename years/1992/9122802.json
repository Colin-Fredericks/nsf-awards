 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anticipated future labor supply shortages of scientists and                engineers have called attention to a national need for greater                  understanding of the factors influencing the recruitment and                    retention of men and women in careers in mathematics, science, and              engineering.  It is particularly important to enhance our knowledge             of the barriers to women's participation in these fields.  This                 project will address the following questions:  What are the                     patterns of knowledge, access, and attitudes that lead women to                 persist in or drop out of mathematics and science?  What                        combination of school, family, and personal/psychological resources             best explains the patterns of development experienced by young                  women in their high school and post-high school mathematics and                 science careers?  What are the typical paths that men follow in                 their mathematics and science careers and how and why do these                  differ from the paths women take?  Analyses of cross-sectional and              longitudinal data from three major nationally representative data               sets, High School and Beyond, the National Educational Longitudinal             Study, and the Second International Educational Assessment of                   Mathematics will be conducted in order to explore patterns of young             women's (and young men's) achievement in math and science as well               as the explanations for these patterns.                                                                                                                              This project, which is jointly supported by the Sociology                  Program and the Education and Human Resources Office of Studies,                Evaluation and Dissemination, will contribute to a number of areas              in the field of sociology, including occupational choice, sociology             of education, sex and gender roles, and social stratification.  The             results of the project will enhance our understanding of how to                 recruit more young people, male as well as female, into careers in              science, mathematics, and engineering.",
