 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Baldwin proposes to measure, for the first time, exchange rates             of individual peptide NH protons within single, isolated alpha-                 helices.  A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique will be                  used, based on 15N spectral editing of the one-dimensional proton               spectrum.  A single peptide NH will be 15N-labeled by chemical                  synthesis of the peptide, and 15N spin echo difference spectroscopy             will be used to give the 1H spectrum of the single 15N-labeled                  peptide NH.  A trial experiment demonstrating the feasibility of                this approach has been made.  The new method will be used to test               the basic assumptions of helix-random coil transition theory, and               also to provide background information about exchange rates of                  amide protons in single alpha-helices, for use in interpreting data             on protein folding intermediates.                                               %%%                                                                             The proposed experiments will provide a new technique for obtaining             structural information about short peptides, for example, when the              peptide is complexed with a specific receptor.  Currently there is              wide interest in \" peptide libraries\", both in the biotechnology                field and in biomedical science generally.  Methodologies have been             developed for synthesizing astronomical numbers of different short              peptide sequences and then for selecting a small number of                      sequences that can bind specifically to a receptor in a signal                  transduction pathway.  This method will provide an important tool               for characterizing the structure of a peptide in a peptide-receptor             complex.  As pointed out above, the method also has direct                      application to the problem of characterizing structures of kinetic              intermediates on the pathway of protein folding.",
