The study will               focus on the use of honorific forms, particularly during the                    daily ceremonial practice of kava preparation and consumption                   (kava is non-alcoholic, soporific beverage made from the pounded                root of the piper methysticum plant and water).  Although                       enthnographers have noted the importance of kava rituals                        throughout Oceania and their role in sustaining structures of                   prestige, very little is known about the use of language in these               contexts.  Preliminary investigation by the doctoral student has                shown kava settings to be particularly rich in the range of                     participants and linguistic choices.                                                 Through the observation and video-recording of spontaneous                 kava events, this study will investigate: a) how honorific forms                are actually used by Pohnpeians in daily practice and how the                   presence of honorific words affects other aspects of the                        language, b) the relationship between lexical choices and the                   exploitation of the social space in which verbal interaction take               place, and c) the range of competence in honorific use across                   generations and how such competence is acquired.",
