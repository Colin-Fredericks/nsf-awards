In US history, agricultural research and agricultural improvement               went through far-reaching social transformations.  As experiments               and improvements ceased to be the province of individual farmers                and instead became the product of professional researchers employed             by state and federal governments, the manner in which `science' was             defined was crucial in justifying transformations.  Drawing upon                agricultural periodicals, agricultural society transactions, state              experiment station reports, and US Department of Agriculture                    publications, this study traces how `science' and `farming' were                characterized, and how these characterizations were used to                     establish social boundaries and scientific institutions.",
