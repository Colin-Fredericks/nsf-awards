 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted on quantum phase                         transitions, that is, phemonena in which the ground state of a                  many-body system changes qualitatively as some control parameter is             varied at zero temperature.  These include transitions from metal               to insulator as a function of interaction strength, randomness or               both, changes in magnetic order with hole density, representation               of the spins, or microscopic couplings, and the transition from                 metal to superconductor with doping.  All these problems have the               common feature that there is generally no obvious small parameter               to allow a clean theoretical calculation.  This will be handled in              a variety of ways: by working with low dimensional analogs amenable             to exact solution, by embedding the given problem in a larger                   family (with bigger spin, bigger group, etc.) where a small                     parameter exists, and by the application of the renormalization                 group which permits one to deal with the problem in stages instead              of all at once.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This work will utilize techniques developed for high energy physics             to investigate phase transitions in condensed matter systems where              the properties of matter change from one form to another, such as               occurs when an insulating material changes to one which has no                  resistance to the flow of electric charge.  Usually these phase                 transitions are studied as a function of temperature.  However, for             this work the calculations will be done at zero temperature where               quantum effects dominate.  The effects to be studied are basic to               many modern problems in condensed matter physics and materials                  science.",
