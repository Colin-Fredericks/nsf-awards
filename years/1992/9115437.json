 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the research of Dr. Havel, who will develop             new computational methods and software for determining the                      conformational states and kinematic behavior of mobile molecules by             means of geometric reasoning.  The resultant computer programs are              expected to be of value to researchers in many areas of structural              chemistry and biochemistry, including spectroscopists who wish to               interpret their data in terms of a precise molecular modes,                     stereochemists who need to find all conformers consistent with a                given bonding arrangement, and molecular biologists attempting to               predict protein and nucleic acid conformation.  Because a wide                  variety of information concerning the structure of molecules can be             encoded in terms of constraints on their interatomic distances, the             first goal is to improve understanding of and ability to reason                 directly with these constraints.  The next goal is to devise more               efficient and reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates                    compatible with the constraints, and  determining what motions are              consistent with them.  The final goal is to have the resulting                  program integrated into a widely available molecular mechanics                  package, so that they can be easily applied to a wide variety of                problems.",
