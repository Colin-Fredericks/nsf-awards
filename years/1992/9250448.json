A laboratory of NeXT workstations is being set up for                 use in teaching and developing both courses.  The advanced                      calculus component is a joint project between Washington and                    Lee University and the University of Michigan and is currently                  in its second year.  The geometry component is a joint project                  between the PI and Professor William Goldman of the University                  of Maryland and is being developed as part of the Utah Regional                 Geometry Institute. Dissemination of the materials developed                    under this project will be via the Summer Geometry Institute in                 Park City, Utah, by distribution to the member institutions of                  the RGI and by publication of the advanced calculus materials.",
