 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposed research is to establish the                  importance of concurrent prostaglandin (PG) synthesis during changes            in hemoglobin (Hb) proportions toward newborn values in anemic adult            rats.  The rats and mice both have no specifically fetal Hb like                humans.  However, for both men and mice, certain congenital anemias             lead to levels of fetal and minor hemoglobins, respectively, close              to those seen shortly after birth.  Since 1982, a variety of                    chemical agents including hydroxyurea have been show to increase                fetal Hb level in humans in animals or in erythroid cultures.                   Hydroxyurea has been also show to induce 3-minor globin in adult                anemic mice.  Several mechanisms have been proposed to justify the              effects of these agents.  However, no single mechanism is adequate              enough to accept as a common mechanism for the reversion of Hb                  proportions in adult life.                                                           It is proposed that studies in adult rats cover the following:             1. The role of recombinant human erythropoietin and several other               agents in the activation of fetal-like Hb proportions in the                    presence and absence of concurrent PG synthesis.  2. The burst                  forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cultures from marrow and peripheral              blood derived cells for synthesis of Hb components in presence of               PGE2.  3. The levels of some E-prostaglandins in plasma of                      recombinant erythropoietin treated and drug treated rats.  The                  several procedures to be employed include ion exchange                          chromatography, HPLC, radioimmunoassay and erythroid culture.                        These studies should lead to an increased knowledge of                     mechanisms which regulate the reversion of Hb proportions toward                newborn values in anemic adult rats.  In addition, these studies may            contribute to the development of a strategy for manipulating Hb                 components in diseases such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.                   Another important objective of this project is to provide an               opportunity to undergraduate and graduate students in the                       departments of biology and chemistry of Tuskegee University to                  receive adequate research training, in an effort to motivate them to            pursue careers in science fields.",
