 "awd_abstract_narration": "An acoustics laboratory is being developed for inclusion in a                   five-week intensive course on musical acoustics.  Non-science                   majors are the primary target audiences.  Twenty-four students                  are meeting five days a week for a two-hour session of lecture,                 demonstration and discussion.  Students working in pairs                        complete a two-hour laboratory experiment each day, in two                      shifts of 12 students each.  In the first two weeks of the                      course, experiments are being developed to introduce concepts                   of mechanics, including vibrations and waves, necessary to                      understand acoustic phenomena.  Resonances in mechanical and                    acoustic systems are a primary focus, using instruments such as                 photogate timers, oscilloscopes, microphones, function                          generators and sound level meters.  Spectral analysis of a                      variety of instruments and sound generators is the topic of the                 second group of experiments.  Each of six lab stations includes                 a Fast Fourier Transform spectrum analyzer for real-time                        analysis, a high-quality microphone with preamplifier, and a                    plotter.  These stations allow students to explore a wide range                 of acoustic phenomena in quantitative detail.  Acquired                         techniques are being used in independent student projects.  The                 equipment is also providing senior thesis opportunities.",
