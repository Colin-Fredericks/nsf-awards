 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will fund the purchase of computer and                            acquisition systems for two JEOL FX90Q nuclear magnetic                         resonance (NMR) spectrometers for use in undergraduate                          laboratories in analytical, physical, and polymer chemistry.                    In analytical chemistry, the labs will focus on a basic                         familiarity with modern NMR instrumentation.  The students will                 also learn how to acquire and manipulate data using                             computerized equipment.  In physical chemistry, the experiments                 focus on basic NMR phenomena and second order and exchange                      effects.  In polymers, NMR will be used to determine the                        stereochemistry, identification, and verification of                            polymerization through the use of carbon-13 and proton NMR.                     Students will also determine the distribution of monomer                        segments in copolymers.  The experiments for the understanding                  of the basic Fourier transform NMR phenomena, as well as those                  for polymer chemistry, are not generally available for faculty                  members in these areas.  These will be developed and shared                     with other educators in these fields.",
