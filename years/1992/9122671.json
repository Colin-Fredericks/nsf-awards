 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the 1980's the closely related subjects of the                      algebraic theory of quadratic forms and the theory of finite-                   dimensional division algebras benefitted greatly from                           developments in algebraic K-theory and algebraic geometry.  The                 topics of this conference, historically speaking, are rooted in                 number theory.  Most of the main problems and motivation have                   number theoretic origins.  In the first half of this century,                   these subjects blossomed with the development of modern algebraic               number theory.  The discovery of local-global principles for                    quadratic forms was bound up with the development of p-adic                     fields.  Further, the classification of finite-dimensional                      division algebras over local and global fields was closely                      connected to the development of class field theory.  In the past                forty years, each of these subjects has declared much                           independence from number theory.                                                     This project will support the 1992 Summer Research Institute               on Quadratic Forms and Division Algebras: Connections with                      Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Geometry (the fortieth in the                  series) to be held from July 6 - 24, 1992 at the University of                  California, Santa Barbara.  The primary topics of the summer                    institute are the closely related subjects of finite-dimensional                division algebras and the algebraic theory of quadratic forms.                  Further progress is expected to be stimulated by holding two                    special lecture series, one devoted to algebraic K-theory and the               other to algebraic geometry.  In addition, there will be research               lectures on the two principal themes, quadratic forms and                       division algebras.  The first week of the institute will have                   quadratic forms emphasis, the third week will have division                     algebra emphasis, and the second week will emphasize both with                  the hope of stimulating interaction.",
