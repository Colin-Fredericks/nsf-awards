 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research on investment decisions under uncertainty has                   highlighted the importance of option values, or of waiting to                   resolve some uncertainty and gather more information.  This work                is mostly restricted to \"classical\" economic environments, with                 perfect risk markets and without economies of scale or                          externalities.  This project extends the analysis to \"non-                      classical\" settings, using corresponding extensions of techniques               of stochastic optimal control.  The more general theory will then               be applied to some important policy issues.  Examples include the               following.                                                                                                                                                      (1) Criteria for investment under uncertainty with scale economies              and externalities will be developed, built into a model of industry             evolution, and linked to the new theory of growth.  (2) Since labor             income risk is hard or impossible to diversify, trade adjustment,               and more generally job losses due to plant closure, alter risk-                 bearing.  The issue, and appropriate policies, will be modelled.                (3) Real rigidities of slow adjustment will be combined with                    nominal inertia into macroeconomic models of employment                         fluctuations.  (4) When evaluating new technologies to reduce                   environmental damage, the value of waiting to gather more                       information must be traded off against the risk of irreversible                 damage while we wait.  This will be formulated as a stochastic                  control problem with filtering.",
