 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms involved in macromolecular recognition are                  central to the understanding of gene regulation.  This project will             examine the nature and relative importance of functional group                  interactions between proteins (and other selected ligands) and                  nucleic acids that are responsible for the formation of high-                   affinity, sequence-specific complexes.  The laboratory will prepare             a series of modified oligodeoxynucleotides as possible recognition              sites for restriction and modification enzymes, a repressor protein             (the tryptophan repressor) as well as selected minor groove binding             ligands.  The modifications have been chosen in order to minimize               structural changes in the B-DNA helix, and involve primarily the                \"deletion\" of selected functional groups.  These DNA fragments will             be prepared by chemical syntheses employing a variety of modified               nucleoside derivatives, including those obtained during the initial             and ongoing periods of this project.  Parallel studies will be                  directed toward the effects of modified bases upon DNA structure                and the implications of such structure modulation upon recognition              processes.  Specifically, we will continue to use modified base                 residues to study DNA curvature phenomena.  Additionally, with the              minor groove modifications proposed for the present project period,             one can examine B-form structure as a function of the ability to                form the putative minor groove spine of hydration.  By studying                 recognition phenomena, using site-specifically modified                         macromolecules, this project should contribute to the understanding             of cellular recognition processes and provide access to a variety               of useful biochemical tools.                                                    %%%                                                                             There are many examples in nature that involve the selective                    production of specialized proteins by cells, tissues, and organs                which result from the expression of particular genes.  This project             will examine the nature of functional group interactions between                proteins and nucleic acid polymers that are responsible for the                 formation of high-affinity, sequence-specific complexes involved in             gene expression.   A series of modified nucleic acid polymers will              be prepared to test with proteins which bind to, cut, or chemically             modify the related natural polymer.  The DNA fragments will be                  prepared by chemical syntheses employing a variety of modified                  nucleoside derivatives. Parallel studies will be directed toward                the effects of modified bases upon DNA structure and the                        implications of such structure modulation upon recognition                      processes.  Thus, by studying recognition phenomena, using site-                specifically modified macromolecules, this project should                       contribute to the understanding of cellular recognition processes               and provide access to a variety of useful biochemical tools.",
