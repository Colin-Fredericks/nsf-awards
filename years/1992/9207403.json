The                             proposed research will include the studies of                                   stereoisomers and deuterium-labelled compounds with the                         aim of getting information on the mechanism of the                              transformations taking place.  Based on these observations                      selective synthesis of certain compounds (carbonyl                              compounds, unsaturated alcohols, dienes) can be expected.                       The results will contribute to the chemistry of                                 carbocations.  Funds for the project are awarded through                        the U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest in accordance with                        established guidelines.",
