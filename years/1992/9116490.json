 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytokinins are a group of plant hormones mediating cell division                and differentiation.  The mechanisms controlling the appropriate                level and activity of cytokinins are not well understood.  The long             term goal of the research project is to identify regulatory                     elements exerting such controls in the genus Phaseolus.  The                    approach is based on the identification of genetic differences in               the metabolism of zeatin (a naturally occurring cytokinin) in                   embryos which led to the isolation of zeatin-specific metabolic                 enzymes.  The enzymes are species-spedific and the products of the              enzymatic reaction display high biological activity.  Selective                 expression of such enzymes may represent important mechanism                    regulating cytokinin activity.  Therefore, genes encoding these                 enzymes may be appropriate targets for molecular and physiological              studies.  Work proposed herein will center on isolating and                     analysing genomic sequences and full length cDNAs of the genes with             emphasis on mechanisms regulating tissue specific expression and                substrate specificity.  The presence and expression of these genes              in other representative dicots and monocots will also be                        determined.  Enzymes purified by immunoaffinity chromatography will             serve as antigen to generate monoclonal antibodies recognizing the              substrate binding epitopes.  Antibodies antigenic to zeatin                     epitope(s) will be employed to isolate and purify other zeatin                  metabolic enzymes and possibly molecules involved in cytokinin                  action.  The proposed research is important in formulating a model              regarding the genetic and developmental controls of hormone                     metabolism in higher plants.",
