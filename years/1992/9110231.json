 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global warming associated with the greenhouse effect has emerged                as a leading environmental concern.  Many nations, including the                United States, are considering policy measures designed to reduce               the rate of green house gas emissions.  Moreover, multilateral                  action is being discussed under the auspices of the                             Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The objective of this               project is to develop a modeling framework for assessing the                    impact on the U.S. economy of policies aimed at mitigating global               climate change.                                                                                                                                                 Specifically, the project consists of three separate, but related               parts.  The first involves developing new econometric methods for               estimating industry-wide models of productivity growth.                         Attention is focused on autonomous increases in efficiency for                  both energy and non-energy inputs.  The underlying model to be                  developed will allow productivity trends to be both deterministic               as well as stochastic.  Second, new methods will be developed for               assessing the distributional impacts of policies aimed at                       mitigating the effects of global climate change.  These                         distributional impacts are likely to be very significant,                       especially for policies that rely on taxation of energy use.  The               third part of the study will involve the development of new                     algorithms in order to achieve the maximum possible computational               efficiency in assessing the impact of policies aimed at                         mitigating climate change.",
