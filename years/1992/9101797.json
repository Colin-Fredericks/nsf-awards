 "awd_abstract_narration": "Submarine springs and seeps discharge a substantial but not                     precisely defined quantity of water into the ocean.  Recent                     estimates suggest that the magnitude of this discharge, driven                  by gravitational and convective forces, may be globally                         significant.  Discharged fluids may consist of fresh water,                     connate waters, brines derived from evaporite deposits, or                      recirculated seawater.  Because the composition of submarine                    hydrologic discharge may be markedly different than seawater,                   this process is capable of contributing significantly to the                    marine geochemical cycling of many elements.                                                                                                                    The proposed research will determine the potential of using                     water column standing crops of the tracers 222Rn, 226Ra and                     CH4, constituents greatly enriched in groundwater relative to                   seawater, for the purpose of locating and assessing submarine                   groundwater discharge to the ocean.  A detailed geochemical                     mass balance will be constructed for the single best tracer,                    222Rn, within a relatively small area on the continental shelf                  of northwest Florida, an area where we expect to find                           appreciable submarine discharge.  Groundwater tracer                            concentrations and fluxes will be measured, both in the form of                 discrete springs and as disseminated seeps.  Benthic fluxes and                 other processes, such as advection and air-sea exchange, which                  contribute to changes in the water column standing crop will be                 evaluated.  These measurements will be modeled to evaluate the                  prospects of developing a simple tracer-based technique for                     determining the magnitude of groundwater discharge to the ocean                 applicable to other areas.",
