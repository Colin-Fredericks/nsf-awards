 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Board of Regents on behalf of its member                          institutions, proposes to establish an academic data network. The               proposal requests partial funding for participation in NSFNET                   through a connection with SURAnet, the regional network attaching               to NSFNET in the Louisiana Area as well as partial start-up funds               for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support to                   facilitate the fullest possible participation.  The educational                 institutions that will participate include: LSU-Alexandria, LSU-                Eunice, LSU-Shreveport, Southern Univ.-New Orleans, Southern                    Univ.-Shreveport, Delgado Community College, Grambling State                    Univ., McNeese State University, Nicholls State University,                     Northwestern State University, Centenary College, Dillard                       University, Central Offices of the Board of Regents, Louisiana                  Universities Marine Consortium, and Loyola University.                                                                                                          The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture for                NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in                        education and research.  This cooperative network will provide                  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and                  will be consistent with their standards.  It will further the                   institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development                through a well-educated workforce, accessible training                          opportunities, and research and development partnerships.                       Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative                      projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including               those outside the state.                                                                                                                                        The universities need greater functionality and network speed to                be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                      transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail               system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.               This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                    innovative educational resources.***//",
