 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to determine the effects of               suspension formulation and rheology on the microstructural                      uniformity of tape-cast ceramic sheets.  The two-dimensional                    component geometry and simple forming technique will facilitate                 modeling of the tape-casting process.  Alumina-based suspensions                will be formulated that contain a bimodal molecular weight (MW)                 distribution of polymethyl methacrylate, with either broad or                   narrow polydispersity.  The effects of polymer MW and distribution              on suspension rheology, particle packing, and the relative ratio                of free to adsorbed polymer in the tapes will be investigated.                  The microscopic distribution of ceramic particles and polymeric                 constituents as a function of direction will be probed by                       themogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy as well              as by measuring the macroscopic dimensional changes these layers                experience during storage, lamination, and densification.                       Ultimately, processes will be designed which lead to improvements               in the microstructural uniformity of tape-cast layers.                               This knowledge will afford greater dimensional control during              multilayer ceramic fabrication which impacts a critical                         technology--multichip electronic packaging.  Tape-casting is a                  critical process for forming the ceramic substrates for ceramic                 printed wiring boards and the uniformity of the sheet determines                the attainable wiring density.",
