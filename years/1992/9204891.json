 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decision of multipotential cells to adopt a myogenic program                of development is controlled by a family of related proteins.                   This family has been greatly conserved in evolution, and                        Drosophila has a gene (nautilus) with extensive homology to these               myogenic regulatory factors. nautilus is expressed is a temporal                and spatial pattern consistent with a role in early myogenesis,                 and examination of its pattern of expression in a variety of                    mutant backgrounds has provided insight into the myogenic                       process. The proposed experiments are designed to utilize the                   unique features that Drosophila provides in an effort to better                 understand the role of this protein in muscle development. These                will include 1) generation and characterization of a nautilus                   mutation, 2) molecular analysis of sequences necessary for rescue               of the mutant phenotype, and 3) identification of nautilus                      targets. Dr. Abmayr has recently generated a genetic deficiency                 that removes the nautilus gene, which will be used to generate a                null allele of nautilus. The mutant phenotype of this deficiency                is characterized by dramatic deformities in the development of                  the musculature, consistent with the possibility that nautilus                  plays a critical role in this process. Dr. Abmayr will utilize P-               element mediated transformation of Drosophila to examine the                    sequences required to rescue the mutant phenotype. To identify                  the in vivo targets of nautilus, she will use an approach                       involving immunoprecipitation of nautilus bound in chromatin, and               the subsequent characterization of the bound sequences.",
