 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the ease with which humans recognize everyday objects, the              processes by which this occurs have become a central concern in                 cognitive science, because object recognition is actually very                  difficult; for example, computer scientists have only been                      partially successful in creating computer programs for recognizing              objects, and even those programs stretch the computational limits               of the most sophisticated machines.  Since humans are \"good at\"                 object recognition, this research will focus on human abilities,                with emphasis on how computational complexities might be handled.               Human recognition takes place over a time span of about 100 ms.,                and the research will use newly developed techniques to control                 exactly what information is available during that period of time.               The working hypothesis underlying this research is that for humans              computational burdens are reduced because the brain uses certain                types of information early in that time period and other types of               information later in that time period.  For example, early in time              general information about the shape or orientation of an object                 might be used to narrow down the possibilities, whereas later in                time information about more idiosyncratic details would be used to              arrive at the proper identification.  The research will examine a               number of possible types of information that have been suggested in             the psychological and computer science literatures.  The research               will also use several related techniques, because each has its own              strengths and weaknesses.  Initial work will use relatively simple              objects for exploration; later work will use large samples of                   common objects.  Later work will also seek to extend principles of              earlier work to the perception of objects within scenes, and to the             process of word perception.  The knowledge gained will help in the              design of robots for a variety of purposes and of aids for visually             disabled persons.",
