 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amphibian egg is axially symmetric before fertilization: its                contents are polarized along one dimension, the animal-vegetal                  axis. The earliest step in the establishment of the embryo's                    bilaterally symmetric body plan, dorsal-ventral axis                            specification, occurs after fertilization, but before the onset                 of zygotic gene expression. Thus, all the components necessary                  for this patterning event are already present at fertilization,                 and become asymmetrically localized or modified during dorsal-                  ventral axis specification. This project proposes to identify                   such components, determine the mechanisms of their localization,                and assess their roles in dorsal-ventral patterning in the frog                 Xenopus laevis. Two cDNA libraries enriched for either dorsal or                ventral transcripts in embryos were recently constructed. Several               clones representing regionally enriched maternal transcripts have               been isolated. Digoxigenin labelled antisense RNA probes are                    presently being used for in situ hybridization analysis to learn                the details of localization of the corresponding RNAs during                    oogenesis and early development. The spatial, temporal, and                     quantitative changes in expressions of specific RNAs will be                    compared with the final morphology of embryos subjected to                      centrifugation, UV irradiation, and over expression of injected                 maternal mRNAs. These analyses will be used to ascertain which                  transcripts are involved in the initiation of early pattern                     events. By providing new information on the relationships between               the spatial localization of some maternal transcripts relative to               the regulation of specific zygotic transcripts, these experiments               will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between                 egg organization and embryonic patterning.",
