However,                  few reliable biological markers of temperament have been                        identified.  Recent research has shown that resting                             electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry recorded from frontal                   regions of the brain is a biological marker that predicts                       individual differences in emotional reactivity and in emotional                 traits.  This research has shown that individuals characterized                 by relative activation of right hemisphere frontal regions have                 an increased predisposition for negative affect and a decreased                 predisposition for positive affect.  The opposite pattern appears               characteristic of individuals with relative left frontal                        activation.  However, the research has left unclear precisely                   what predisposition are linked to frontal asymmetry.  In                        addition, prior work has not linked anterior asymmetry to known                 functions mediated by the frontal lobes.  On the basis of                       evidence concerning functions mediated by the frontal lobes and                 evidence concerning affective traits that are linked to anterior                asymmetry, it is proposed that the critical predispositions                     linked to frontal asymmetry are individual differences in                       cognitive and related processes that serve to regulate or                       modulate emotional reactions or goal-directed performance on                    tasks that elicit significant emotion.  It is hypothesized that                 relative left anterior activation promotes access to cognitive                  processes that serve to amplify or sustain positive affect and to               inhibit or dampen negative affect.  It is hypothesized that                     relative right anterior activation is linked to the opposite                    pattern.  To test these hypotheses, four experiments will be                    conducted to assess the relation between resting frontal                        asymmetry and: 1. various components of a \"state\" vs \"action\"                   orientation in response to experimentally induced failure; 2.                   self-focused attentional responses to success and failure; 3.                   selective memory for affectively toned events; and 4. selective                 attention to affective stimuli.  These studies will help                        elucidate the critical predispositions linked to resting frontal                asymmetry and will have more general implications for models of                 the  contribution of the cerebral cortex to individual                          differences in  emotion-related personality traits.  In addition,               because few studies have assessed the relation between the                      prefrontal cortex and the regulation of emotion, the present                    studies will contribute to knowledge concerning the functions                   served by this clearly important, yet largely uncharted, region                 of the brain.",
