 "awd_abstract_narration": "To enable a listener to localize a sound source, the auditory                   system suppresses echoes that result from reflections of the sound              off nearby objects.  Psychoacoustic experiments have provided                   evidence that some of this suppression occurs within a group of                 nerve cells--the cochlear nuclear complex--which is the first                   integrative stage in the auditory system.  Anatomical and                       physiological experiments on brain slices that include the cochlear             nuclei have identified neurons in the upper portion of the cochlear             nuclear complex that are candidates for mediating the echo                      suppression effect.                                                                                                                                             The major purpose of these experiments is to examine,                           physiologically, the suppression of echoes in the cochlear nuclear              complex and to determine whether the suppression is due to the                  candidate neurons.  Microelectrode recordings are made from single              neurons to various sound stimuli to study the effects of echo                   suppression, since even though echos are suppressed for                         localization of a sound, they do make a contribution to perception              of the sound. Responses of neurons to pairs of stimuli will be                  recorded to determine whether and under what conditions the                     response to a second click is suppressed by the first. Also,                    responses will be recorded from different neurons in the lower                  cochlear nucleus to determine whether there are neurons that do not             show echo suppression.",
