 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new course - along with class notes                 and related computer exercises - designed to strengthen                         freshmen programs in engineering. The course called                             Introduction to Engineering Analysis will provide an integrated                 treatment of vector mechanics, primarily statics, and linear                    algebra, with a concurrent emphasis on the use of computer-                     based methods for solving problems. Students will learn key                     principles of mechanics and linear algebra in one integrated                    course.  Students will be presented with a more coherent and                    realistic picture of the relevance of linear algebra and                        computational methods in the solution of engineering problems.                  The project will result in the development of all instructional                 materials and a trial offering of the course, followed by                       evaluations and revisions, and ending with a finished course                    and associated notes and exercises, including computer                          exercises, which can be disseminated to other institutions                      interested in this new approach.",
