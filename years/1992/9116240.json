 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Robert                   Bernheim, Pennsylvania State University, and Paola Bicchi,                      University of Siena, Italy.  This project is directed toward three              areas of molecular and laser spectroscopy that have evolved out of              previous contacts with scientists from Pisa, Siena, and Florence.               The objectives of the research collaboration are threefold:  laser-             induced shifts in chemical equilibrium; molecular spectroscopy of               vapors of the Group III Elements:  Ga, In, Tl; and cooperative                  fluorescence studies of translational recoil of photodissociation               products.                                                                                                                                                       The equilibrium shift studies are of fundamental importance as they             provide unambiguous evidence for the use of lasers to \"guide\"                   chemical reactions.  The collaboration will seek to extend this                 remarkable effect to chemical systems other than alkali metal                   vapors, possibly even to a stabilized vapor of H-atoms.  The                    proposed studies of molecules such as In2 will reveal the potential             of these systems for active gain media for visible and uv eximer                lasers.  Cooperative fluorescence studies will provide an alternative           method for the investigation of translational energy partitioning               resulting from photodissociation processes.  The major benefit of               the collaboration is the sharing of equipment -- a Bomem Fourier                transform spectrometer at Penn State; a tunable mode-locked laser               system and proper detection apparatus for quantum beat                          experiments in Florence; and tunable, pulsed and CW dye lasers in               all locations where researchers with special skills and expertise               make use of special variations.  One of the major benefits of this              work will be the stimulation of international activity in the field of          laser-guided chemistry.  Furthermore, the cooperative fluorescence              method is a powerful, but unused, tool for studies of molecular                 dynamics.",
