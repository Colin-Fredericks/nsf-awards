 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to research and develop                the use of the qualitative reasoning paradigm for providing                     intelligent support to the preliminary aspects of simulation                    model design.  Specifically, the research will be targeted at the               application of qualitative reasoning to the description                         validation and the conceptual model design activities.  In order                to achieve this goal, the specific Phase II objectives are to                   develop ontologies for a specific manufacturing system domain and               the simulation modeling domain; to extract and formalize Common                 Sense Principles of System Operation; to refine the IDEF3 model-                theoretic semantics; to research and prototype a qualitative                    reasoning engine comprising ontological and common sense                        reasoning components; and to demonstrate the application of this                qualitative reasoning engine to the tasks of description                        validation and conceptual model design.                                              The main benefits of the proposed research will be to                      provide intelligent support for the initial analysis and model                  design tasks of the simulation modeling proces; to enhance the                  productivity of both the domain expert nd the simulation analyst;               and to enhance the acceptance of simulation modeling techniques                 by decision makers in industry and business.  The results of this               research have the potential to make a significant impact on the                 state-of-the-art in simulation modeling technology.",
