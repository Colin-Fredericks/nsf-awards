 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conservation of biological diversity is now a global concern.  The              newly developing science of conservation biology seeks to enhance               the connections between basic ecological theory and its application             to conservation, thus providing sound principles for guiding                    conservation practice.  Support from a Career Advancement Award                 will provide training to enable the Principal Investigator to                   direct future research on applied problems in the conservation and              management of plant communities.  Basic theory on plant succession              (i.e., the growth and recovery of plant communities following                   disturbance) will be considered for its applicability to issues of              plant community conservation and management.  Research time during              a one-year sabbatical leave will be divided between two locations:              1) The Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia, which has a                 growing program in conservation ecolgy, and 2) The Savannah River               Ecology Laboratory, which has an established record of research on              plant succession and the recovery of disturbed plant communities,               particularly wetlands.  Specific objectives will include:  1)                   literature research on the existing theory of conservation and                  restoration in order to identify those areas most in need of futher             research, 2) training in methods of analyzing ecological                        landscapes, and 3) practical experience in plant community                      restoration.",
