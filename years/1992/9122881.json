 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Polish Joint Fund project between              Dr. Ryszard Kozlowski of the Institute of Natural Fibers and Dr.                Tom Maloney of the Washington State University is to research use               of some annual plants wastes for production of particleboards.  The             researchers will also perform research on urea-formaldehyde resin               that allows lowering of formaldehyde emmissions.  The proposed                  research will provide new knowledge of a production of a new                    class of particleboards with lowered formaldehyde emission on the               basis of annual plants wastes and modified urea-formaldehyde                    resins.                                                                                                                                                         This project in materials fulfills the program objectives of                    advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities               in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of               equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
