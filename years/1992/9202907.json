 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of anharmonicity and of atomic disorder on the                      vibrational properties of crystals are to be studied by means of                simulation and other computational techniques.  Molecular dynamics              simulations will be used to study the structure in phonon                       lineshapes arising from both sources.  These will be supplemented               by lattice dynamical calculations using theories such as the                    coherent potential approximation for disordered crystals.                       Previous studies of the thermodynamic properties of quantum                     anharmonic solids will be continued.  The primary technique here                will be the effective-potential Monte Carlo procedure which has                 recently been developed, as well as quantum Monte Carlo for                     comparison.  We also intend to explore the extension of the                     effective potential method to deal with dynamical properties.                   Disordered materials to be studied will include mixtures of the                 alkali halides, noble metal alloys and iron-based alloys.  The                  quantum solids will include the high pressure phases of helium.                 %%%                                                                             This award is a Research at Undergraduate Institution one to                    conduct computational studies of the properties of solids which are             affected by anharmonic vibrations and disorder associated with the              underlying atomic structure.  Materials to  be studied include                  alkali halide mixtures and metal alloys.",
