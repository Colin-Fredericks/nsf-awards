 "awd_abstract_narration": "By what process do individuals acquire a second language?  During               early stages of learning second language words, people often report             being aware of their first language.  However, as they become more              proficient in the second language, they begin to report that they               can think directly in the second language without reference to the              first language.   Although there is empirical evidence to support               these common observations, we do not fully understand how memory                changes to accommodate the acquisition of words in a new language,              or how skilled bilinguals develop cognitive mechanisms that allow               them rapid access to each language and also to the interconnections             between their languages.                                                                                                                                        The general goal of this research is to explore the changes in                  memory that occur as adults acquire a second language, and to                   compare the performance of beginning second language learners to                skilled bilinguals.  A specific goal of the research is to test and             evaluate a new model of cross-language interconnection in which the             connections between the two languages are thought to be asymmetric.             The model proposes that there are asymmetries in the strength of                the connections between lexical (word-to-word) representations in               different languages.  The model also proposes asymmetries between               lexical representations and concepts.                                                                                                                           Two lines of research will test the predictions of the new model.               The first concerns predictions for cross-language performance in                naming, translation, priming, and memory tasks.  A central claim in             this work is that there are two different routes to translation:                translation from the first language to the second language requires             understanding the meaning of the second language word, whereas                  translation from the second language to the first can be                        accomplished on the basis of associations between words in the two              languages.  One set of experiments will evaluate the evidence for               this claim and also test implications for later memory performance.             A second line of research will explore the development of the                   hypothesized cross-language asymmetries over the course of second               language learning in adults by determining the factors that                     influence how quickly an individual becomes fluent in the second                language.                                                                                                                                                       The results of the proposed experiments will have important                     implications for theories of memory and for understanding levels of             language processing and their interaction.  In addition, by                     identifying the way in which a new memory system is established for             second language words during second language acquisition, the                   research will suggest ways in which basic cognitive research can be             applied to second language instruction and bilingual education.                 Given the changing demographic characteristics of our society, this             is an issue of increasing importance.",
