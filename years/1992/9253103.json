 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurogenesis, the proliferation and differentiation of cells that               give rise to neurons, plays a fundamental role in shaping the                   developing nervous system.  Currently, little is known about                    molecules that regulate neurogenesis in mammals and other higher                vertebrates.  To facilitate the study of vertebrate neurogenesis at             the molecular level, an in vitro system has been developed                      involving primary culture of a relatively simple germinative                    neuroepithelium, the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the mouse embryo.             Immortalized cell lines, which have some properties of OE neuronal              precursors, have also been generated, but failure of these cell                 lines to differentiate fully precludes their usefulness for many                studies.  The objective of the experiments performed during this                Research Planning Grant is to generate conditionally-immortalized               cell lines capable of undergoing full differentiation into                      olfactory receptor neurons.  A strategy specifically designed to                select for differentiating cell lines, involving use of an existing             strain of transgenic mice, will be used in these preliminary                    experiments.  Future studies to be conducted with cell lines                    generated during the planning period would be directed towards                  identifying gene products characteristic of the neuronal precursor              phenotype.  Specifically, a molecular genetic approach (\"promoter               trapping\") would be used to identify genes that are expressed in                proliferating neuronal precursor cells and are turned off upon                  terminal neuronal differentiation.  Genes identified using this                 approach would then be analyzed with respect to pattern and timing              of expressing in vivo during normal development, to determine                   whether they are expressed in all germinative neuroepithelia; such              widely-expressed genes are potentially of general importance in the             regulation of neurogenesis.",
