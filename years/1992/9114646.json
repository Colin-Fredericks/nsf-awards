 "awd_abstract_narration": "A first-principles electronic theory of alloy phase stability is                used to investigate the thermodynamic properties and the                        temperature-composition phase diagrams of binary and ternary                    systems.  The emphasis of this study is on the development and                  testing of computational schemes - based on quantum mechanical                  calculations of binding energies, vibrational entropies and                     configurational entropies - in order to predict solid state phase               stability.  Electronic structure calculations of the total energy               of ordered compounds are carried out using the Linear Muffin-Tin                Orbital and the Local Density Approximations.  The Liner Muffin-Tin             Orbitals total energy calculations are used to obtain multiatom                 effective chemical interactions, equilibrium lattice constants,                 bulk moduli, Debye temperatures, Gruneisen Constants and expansion              coefficients of configurationally ordered compounds.  These                     calculations provide all information necessary for the computation              of equilibrium phase diagrams.  Ternary equilibrium and metastable              phase diagrams will be calculated for a number of important                     alumindes to establish trends which may offer predictive results.               %%%                                                                             Calculations of accurate alloy phase diagrams have usually been                 based on experimental input and phenomenological models.  The                   resulting phase diagrams were sometimes lacking in predictive                   capability.  The research proposed here will calculate phase                    diagrams based on first-principles; essentially providing only the              properties of the atoms making up the alloy.  The calculation of                first-principles phase diagrams is an important step in the design              of new materials having desired properties.  The present work will              develop techniques to do these calculations for the more difficult              case of ternary alloys.",
