 "awd_abstract_narration": "Memories often require the pulling together of different elements               of information.  \"Associative learning\" is the process by which                 humans and other animals learn to connect, or associate,                        different elements, events, or concepts.  A fundamental form of                 this process is classical conditioning.  Rats will learn that one               stimulus, such as a tone or a light, is associated with the                     occurrence of another stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild                 footshock; the tone or light will come to evoke behavior, such as               a mild fear, provided the subject has learned to associate that                 stimulus with footshock and then remembers the stimulus-footshock               association.  This project will investigate memory and behavior                 when stimuli are associated with conflicting events or stimuli                  (e.g., shock and food, or food and no food).  Previous research                 has shown that memory and behavior in this situation is strongly                determined by the current \"context,\" stimuli that are present in                the background, which can select between competing associations.                Behavior evoked by stimuli associated with multiple events can                  also change as the memories age over time.  The project will                    investigate how time and context influence memory and                           performance, and also how the effects of time and context might                 interact.  By studying the effects of time and context on                       behavior over a range of related situations, the research will                  provide insight into how ambiguous information is stored,                       retrieved, and then expressed in behavior and emotional                         performance.                                                                                                                                                    The research will have its primary impact on theories of                        learning, memory, and acquired motivation.  It will also be                     relevant to research on the neurobiology of learning and memory,                which has recently begun to identify biological processes in                    cells of the brain that may correspond to the learning and memory               processes investigated here.  The results will also have                        implications for cognitive-behavioral therapies of human behavior               disorders (e.g., drug dependence and anxiety), which often                      introduce new learning designed to conflict with cognition and                  behavior based on previous learning.",
