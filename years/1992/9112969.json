 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to study how students                     learn abstract mathematics.  The specific situation to be                       studied is how students increase their level of                                 sophistication in mathematics so that they can understand                       abstract algebra at the undergraduate level.  In addition,                      since abstract algebra is a basic course for teachers, it                       has influence on the education of teachers and how they                         learn, and whence, how they teach mathematics in the                            schools.                                                                                                                                                             The design of the research study will include the study                    of \"traditional\" approach to teaching this course and a                         pedagogical approach that involves the use of computers to                      initially construct the abstract objects that occur in an                       abstract algebra course combined with a cooperative learning                    environment.  This study will be carried out at a number of                     universities and by several faculty members at those                            universities.                                                                                                                                                        There will be a faculty workshop and minicourses given                     at professional meetings to disseminate the findings of this                    research and the techniques developed to help in learning                       abstract concepts.",
