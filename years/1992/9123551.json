Their research will focus on                                      several current topics in the theory of                                         computation, including structural complexity                                    theory and Kolmogorov complexity theory.  The                                   planned collaboration will be expedited by                                      several reciprocal working meetings among the                                   participants that will give opportunities to                                    local young researchers and particularly                                        graduate students to benefit from participation                                 in the discussions.                                                                                                                                             This research lies on the boundary between                                      mathematics and computer science.  The various                                  research partnerships among the seven                                           participants should yield significant results in                                several central areas of complexity theory.  The                                complementary expertise contributed by the U.S.                                 and Dutch participants has the potential to                                     contribute insights and connections which would                                 not emerge without the cooperative interactions.",
