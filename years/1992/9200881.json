 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme of this project is understanding how certain types               of surfaces and 2-dimensional objects can be embedded, immersed,                and, in general, positioned in the 3-dimensional sphere.  Three                 ongoing collaborative projects and one individual one are involved,             concerning (1) links represented by closed braids, with Joan S.                 Birman of Columbia University, (2) planar surfaces and the cabling              conjecture, with Abigail A. Thompson of the University of                       California, Davis, (3) embeddings and immersions in highly                      alternating link exteriors, with Morwen B. Thistlethwaite of the                University of Tennessee, and (4) the Milnor-Bennequin conjecture                and unknotting number.  (1) seeks better ways of calculating about              such links, possibly leading to a more efficient effective                      algorithm than Haken's for distinguishing oriented links.  (3)                  builds upon a recent joint triumph in settling the hundred-year-old             Tait flyping conjecture.                                                             Knots and their generalization, links, are rather elementary               geometric objects whose really interesting properties are                       topological.  By this we mean that two geometric knots do not                   differ in an interesting way if one of them can be transformed to               look just like the other without cutting or untying it, just by                 pushing its string about to rearrange the crossings.  Topologists               say that they are two different geometric realizations of the same              topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to                  recognize when one complicated geometric knot is topologically                  different from another, rather than just a different geometric                  realization.  This problem can be addressed by computing certain                numbers or polynomials which are called \"topological invariants,\"               meaning that they always have the same value for different                      geometric realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem               would be reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which              also always had different values for geometric realizations of                  different topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single             invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants                taken together.  It is therefore valuable to investigate new                    invariants, some of the most useful being those inspired in recent              years by ideas from quantum physics.  The investigator has been in              the thick of this activity and has been particularly successful in              applying some new polynomial invariants to settle old questions                 about alternating knots.  He will continue to exploit these                     techniques as well as some more geometric ones.",
