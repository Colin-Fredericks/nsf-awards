 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates metals processing equipmentinto a                     materials processing laboratory to improve the education of                     technicians for industry and laboratories.  Recognizing that                    research and development in the field of materials has been                     advancing rapidly with ever increasing applications of new                      manufacturing processes to make better products for society,                    Hocking Technical College of Nelsonville, Ohio, instituted in                   1989 an Associate of Applied Science program in Materials                       Engineering Technology, and manufacturing courses in the                        Drafting & Design Technology area were modified to include more                 materials education.  This project were further enhance these                   programs.  The metal processing equipment requested includes:                   a furnace with atmosphere capability suitable for heat treating                 many kinds of metals, and a non-ferrous metal melter.  These                    two items enhance the education of technicians by providing                     hands-on experience with a variety of heat treating methods and                 the ability to melt metals such as aluminum and brass.  In this                 way, structures caused by processing of metals can be more                      effectively related to resulting properties.",
