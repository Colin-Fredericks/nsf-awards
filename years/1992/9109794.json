 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gateway Coalition proposes to open new \"gateways\" for learning              by altering engineering education from a focus on course content                to the development of human resources and the broader experience                in which individual curriculum parts are connected and integrated.              The scope of the program includes four major parts: curriculum                  structure, human potential development, instructional technology                and methodology, and evaluation measures.  Gateway efforts will                 broaden, expand and enrich emerging innovations with new issues and             a pervasive framework.  The intellectual threads will weave                     together: 1) the introduction of engineering and its functional                 core \"up-front,\" 2) a unified and connected supportive knowledge                \"as needed,\" 3) the integrative aspects of the engineering process,             and 4) instructional technologies.  Representing a diversity of                 institutional cultures imbedded in regions of significant                       underrepresented minorities population, the Coalition will impact               engineering education through structure, content, and                           interinstitutional linkages.  The program will emphasize engaging               students in engineering from the day they matriculate; making the               study of engineering more attractive, exciting and fulfilling;                  developing students as emerging professional leaders with the                   knowledge base and capability for lifelong learning; increasing the             the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities and the disabled              participating in engineering; and drawing engineering faculty to                a dedicated investment in the teaching of undergraduate students.",
