 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automatic assembly sequence generation (ASG) is important for                efficient manufacturing and concurrent engineering.  There are                  two main difficulties with developing tools for ASG: (i) the                    combinatorics makes solutions by blind search intractable and                   (ii) criteria for optimal assembly sequences are difficult to                   formalize.                                                                           Earlier work of the PI investigated the use of case-based                  reasoning techniques to simultaneously address both problems with               encouraging results especially concerning the extensibility to                  covering large sets of problems.  The practical objective of this               project is to verify these results on a larger prototype, and                   thus demonstrate the usefulness of case-based assembly sequence                 generation for practical applications.  The theoretical                         objectives of this project are to investigate new methods for                   adaptive learning and case matching which will form part of the                 new prototype.                                                                       The result of this work is a fully implemented case-based                  reasoning system for a large class of assembly devices.  The                    conceptual results involved in building such a system should                    prove useful to research in intelligent design and manufacturing                systems and in case-based reasoning field.",
