 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are combining current technology obtained from the field of                  optical communications with a comprehensive computer-based                      learning environment as a means of bringing information age                     optical technology into the undergraduate laboratory at                         moderate cost.  Recent advances in monolithic modelocked                        semiconductor lasers and rare earth doped optical fiber                         amplifiers are providing an easily maintained and relatively                    low cost means of introducing subpicosecond optical pulses                      produced at high repetition rate into the undergraduate                         laboratory.  The short duration of the pulses and the high peak                 intensities make a large number of experiments that have not                    been previously available except to a small number of research                  workers and advanced graduate students, accessible to                           undergraduate students.  This technology combined with the                      computerized learning environment provides a means for much of                  the science and technology underlying high data rate optical                    communications to be taught to undergraduates in a graphic and                  easily understood manner.  The consistent user interface of the                 CUPLE (Comprehensive Unified Physics Learning Environment)                      employed across different media, such as, laboratory                            instruments, data arrays, graphical displays, and video                         recordings provides a powerful, but easily accessed teaching                    tool for conveying both the drama and the relatively simple                     concepts that characterize this rapidly developing area.  The                   rapid evolution of technology in this field suggests that                       further increases in reliability and ease of operation and                      reduction in costs will make this learning environment                          available to a large number of users at reasonable cost.",
