Applied economics research within the Department of Economics              at MIT,  particularly in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy,               financial economics,  labor economics,  and economic planning in                developing countries,  requires computational support for                       processing and statistical analysis of large data sets,  as well                as related forecasting and simulation activities.  This proposal                will provide scientific workstations for applied economics faculty,             and their research assistants,  with sufficient storage and                     computational capacity to carry out this research program.  In the              past,  the research program has been limited to projects that could             be performed on personal computers,  or which have large extramural             budgets for mainframe computing.  The workstations provided under               this proposal will expand substantially the flexibility of the                  research program,  provide research assistants earlier access to                the analysis of large data sets,  and permit studies that                       previously could not be done with available resources.                               The MIT Economics Department is among the best in the country.             The type of research which it proposes accords with core objectives             of NSF's Division of Social and Economic Science and its potential              contribution to the education and development of human resources                is outstanding.",
