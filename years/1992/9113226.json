 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstractions are the basis for most of the ways that programmers look           at their programs, data, and execution.  Most of these abstractions             have a visual component.  This work envisions a system that will allow          programmers to rapidly define abstractions and their accompanying               visualizations.  Such a system would have immediate applications to             programming environments, data bases, parallel programming, and                 education.  This project will investigate what it means to design such          a system and to explore many of the underlying problems that must be            solved before such a system can become a reality.  In conjunction with          other research projects, it will lead to an abstraction-based                   visualization environment to experiment with various solutions to               these problems and to evaluate the underlying concepts.",
