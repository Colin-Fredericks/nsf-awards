 "awd_abstract_narration": "When the principal investigator arrived at Hendrix College                      three years ago, there were no advanced optics courses and no                   optics laboratories at any level.  Since we felt that an                        understanding of light and its interaction with matter is an                    essential part of a physics curriculum and that hands-on                        experiences will greatly enhance that understanding, the                        physics department has been making a concerted effort to remedy                 that situation.  This project provides the laboratory equipment                 needed to implement optics laboratories and demonstrations                      throughout the physics curriculum.  The non-science majors are                  being provided with an exposure to experimental optics through                  four contact hours of laboratories and demonstrations that are                  being integrated into their lecture sessions.  For the science                  majors in our introductory courses, four of the laboratory                      sessions in the second term are devoted to optics.  This                        provides 12 contact hours of experimental optics.  The modern                   optics course has eight laboratory sessions, which provides 24                  hours of contact time.  Most physics majors participate in                      undergraduate research while at Hendrix.  This project provides                 the basic resources for offering student research projects in                   optical data processing, holography, fiber optics, and laser                    physics.  Since we provide for such a wide range of courses,                    the proposed equipment has multiple uses.   Special attention                   has been paid in the purchase of the equipment to insure the                    compatibility of components between projects.  Portions of all                  the apparatus is being woven into the laboratories at each                      level.  The emphasis at the lower levels is in geometric and                    physical optics.  At the upper levels, the emphasis shifts to                   more specific topics in contemporary optics.",
