 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative: This proposal supports collaborative                       research in wind engineering between Dr. Robert Scanlan of Johns                Hopkins University and Dr. Prem Krishna of the University of                    Roorkee, India.  Experiments will be conducted at the Corrsin                   laminar flow wind tunnel at Hopkins and at the new boundary layer               tunnel at Roorkee.  Research will be carried out on the specific                use and interpretation of bridge deck section models and building               models in the respective wind tunnels.  A backlog of theory                     developed at Hopkins on the use of flutter derivatives in                       determining wind stability will be used relative to section                     models at Roorkee and Hopkins.  Together with various experiments               for obtaining flutter derivatives, new techniques for                           interpreting the forthcoming data will be applied.  The research                will address determining the detailed geometric forms                           needed in deck models to enhance stability.                                                                                                                     Scope: This supports funding for travel of the principal                        investigators for exchanges at each other's base of operations                  and for experimental work at Roorkee.  The proposed collaboration               is expected to continue the development of the flutter                          derivatives concept which is considered a major advance in wind                 engineering, to extend abroad the influence of U.S. methods of                  long-span bridge aerodynamic design, and to lead to enhanced                    capabilities in both countries.  In India, this research will                   lead to developing modelling expertise, to the improvement of                   design and construction techniques, technical education and to                  minimization of the enormous damage caused by wind storms.",
