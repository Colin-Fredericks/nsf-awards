 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detritus is present in all aquatic ecosystems and yet there                is still much debate about its importance in supporting the                     growth of large organisms, such as invertebrates and fish.                      For example, mangrove detritus may not be utilized directly by                  shrimp but it may support a rich microbial assemblage that                      ultimately supports shrimp growth. This study will test the                     hypothesis that the foodweb based on mangrove detritus is                       important in supporting the growth of post-larval penaeaid                      shrimp.  The proposed research will be carried out in a Costa                   Rican estuary which has large shrimp fisheries and a biological                 station.                                                                             Although early studies using stomach analysis emphasized the               importance of mangrove detritus in supporting shrimp growth, more               recent studies have challenged this.  To help resolve this                      controversy, stomach contents and stable isotope (C, N and S)                   analysis and mesocosm experiments will be conducted to examine                  shrimp growth and possible food chain isotope fractionation. By                 combining tools in invertebrate biology, microbiology and                       geochemistry it may be possible to determine the ultimate source                of primary production (mangroves, phytoplankton or benthic algae)               supporting growth of postlarval shrimp. This research will also                 examine whether the microbial loop, here supported by mangrove                  detritus, is a source or sink for the biomass production of                     higher trophic levels.",
