 "awd_abstract_narration": "The individuality of neurons is determined by the particular                    complement of functional ion channels present in the neuronal                   membrane.  Different neurons express varying numbers of channels                selective for sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride ions, and as              a consequence have specific patterns of responses to incoming                   excitatory and inhibitory stimuli.  In order to understand how the              individuality of neurons is established, a class of potassium                   currents whose activity influences both the waveform of single                  action potentials and the pattern of repetitive action potentials               will be studied.  Experiments will be performed on cultured                     embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons, a standard preparation for                 study of early neural development.  It has been previously observed             that the expression in neurons of two variant forms of transient                potassium currents, termed A-current and D-current, is dependent on             contact with non-neuronal glial cells.  Since A- and D-currents are             involved in neuronal electrogenesis, these observations raise the               possibility that glial cells modulate neuronal activity by                      influencing channel expression.  To understand how this process                 might occur, the precise molecular relationship between A- and                  D-current channels should be clarified.  In the present experiments             differences in gating and permeation behavior at the single channel             level will be examined.  Future experiments will focus on issues of             gene expression and post-translational modification that may                    establish the differences between the ion channels underlying A-                and D-currents.",
