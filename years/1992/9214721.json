This will be made possible by the              High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Project and                the National Research and Education Network (NREN)>  The                        availability and description of these capabilities needs to be made             known to the medical informatics community.  The conference theme,              together with the published abstracts of the presentations, is                  designed to accomplish this objective.  This conference will bring              together policy level representatives from the numerous                         constituencies which are essential for the design, development,                 deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance computer                network to meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration              and productivity in the United States.",
