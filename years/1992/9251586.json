 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entails the introduction of microcomputer-based                     laboratories into the introductory physics curriculum.  These                   microcomputer-based laboratories replace existing labs in the                   introductory calculus-based course and in the introductory                      course for non-scientists.  Studies indicate that introductory                  courses in physics do a poor job in developing the students                     conceptual understanding of even the most basic physical                        concepts, and that an interactive and discovery-oriented                        approach is much more effective.  Rather than the standard                      labs, in which students do experiments to verify formulas                       discussed in lecture, it is much more effective to have                         students discover the formula or relationship themselves.                       Similar to the professional physicist, students are doing                       physics at the forefront of their knowledge--also similar is                    their level of enthusiasm. The microcomputer-based laboratories                 and associated curricular materials provide the tools for                       students to become active participants in the learning process.                 The Motion program allows the students to observe real time                     displays of their own motion, and that of other familiar                        objects, and actively engages the students in discovering the                   relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration.  The                 real-time display enables students to redo experiments very                     quickly, allowing them to discover for themselves the                           experimental process, and giving then the freedom to explore                    new situations.  Curricular materials are currently available                   for Mechanics, Sound, and Heat and Temperature.  The hardware                   for the microcomputer-based laboratories is also being used in                  the Electricity and Magnetism labs in conjunction with                          materials recently developed at M.I.T. called ZAP: A Hands-on                   Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism.  All of the                          laboratories are highly interactive.",
