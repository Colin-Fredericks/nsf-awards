 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for a one day symposium entitled \"Development               and Evolution of the Vertebrate Head\". This symposium, sponsored                by the American Society of Zoology's Division of Developmental                  and Cell Biology and co-sponsored by the Division of Vertebrate                 Morphology will be held as part of the Society's 1991 annual                    meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal of this symposium is to                   develop a stronger understanding of the special role of                         development in evolution by focusing on a single topic, the                     vertebrate head. To accomplish this goal, the organizers will                   bring together biologists from a wide range of fields, all of                   whom are actively pursuing research into one or more areas of                   developmental and/or evolutionary biology of the vertebrate head.               Among the invited speakers are both world renowned experts and                  some of the most promising young investigators in this field.                   Their topics span from functional morphology and evolution,                     through morphological and experimental embryology, cell/tissue                  culture to molecular analysis providing comprehensive inclusion                 of the various 'levels' at which the development of the                         vertebrate head is studied. With this wide range of experts,                    focusing on a single issue, the vertebrate head, this symposium                 will be able to synthesize a more fundamental understanding of                  the relationship of development and evolution. Proceedings of the               symposium, which will be published either by American Zoologist                 or is a separate book volume, will provide students and                         scientists with an interest in development and evolution, a                     timely and insightful synthesis on our current understanding of                 the interrelationships of these two biological fields and will                  provide a useful reference source for future studies for many                   years to come.",
