 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                chemical engineering between Sohail Murad of the University of                  Illinois at Chicago and J.G. Powles of the University of Kent,                  United Kingdom.  They propose to conduct a comprehensive study                  of the molecular and macroscopic behavior of fluids with restricted             flow geometries, using computer simulation methods.  They will                  examine well-defined geometries, such as slits and pores, and more              irregular geometries, including random porous systems.  The                     investigators' collaboration during the last six years has resulted in          a novel technique that attaches a subset of molecules in the                    simulation to appropriate positions for obtaining any desired                   geometry. This technique will allow them to study the behavior of               fluids as the boundary changes from impermeable to a permeable                  wall.                                                                                                                                                           The international aspects of this collaboration are significant.  Both          the U.S. and British investigators are expert in molecular dynamics             and theory.  The two groups will carry out independent molecular                dynamics studies and numerical simulations.  They will compare                  data and results.  Their joint effort will allow rapid progress and             advance our understanding of the molecular behavior of polar fluids             such as ammonia and hydrogen chloride.  Their research is of                    fundamental and practical interest to a wide variety of disciplines in          materials science, chemsitry and biology, where permeable and                   semipermeable membranes and porous flow are encountered.",
