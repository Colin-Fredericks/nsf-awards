 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances in remote sensing technology have made possible             nearly continous monitoring of the atmosphere in fine spatial de-               tail. Several new observing systems, including wind profilers,                  NEXRAD doppler radars, automated surface observing stations,                    computer-assisted aircraft observing systems, and improved                      satellite instrumentation have either been recently deployed, or                will be deployed in the U.S. in the 1990's. At the same time                    computer facilities with order-of magnitude increases in                        computational capability have become available to the National                  Weather Service (NWS). These advances offer opportunites for                    significant improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP),                 exemplified by development of a 30-km resolution mesoscale model                (the . model) at the National Meteorological Center (NMC),                      scheduled for operational use in about 1992. A critical element in              the advancement of NWP is the more accurate specification of the                initial state, using the full capability of the advanced systems to             be deployed. The work proposed combines two mathematical approaches             (\"nudging\" and the adjoint equation method) in the development of               a 4-dimensional (spatial and time) data assimilation (4DDA) scheme.             It carries through to the testing and evaluation of such a scheme               at PSU. The NMC has already expressed interest, contigent upon the              PSU research results, in transferring the scheme and testing it in              an operational environment.",
