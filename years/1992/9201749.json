 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to explore the feasibility of extracting,                 amplifying, and sequencing phylogenetically informative nuclear and             chloroplast DNA from a broad array of Miocene plant fossils,                    amplified and sequenced.  Sequence analysis of chloroplast DNA and              nuclear ribosomal DNA has provided the most powerful tool for                   rigorous analysis of the phylogeny of green plants.  However, the               evidence for inferring phylogenetic pattern is indirect---i.e.,                 cpDNA and rDNA has been compared only for living members of the                 Chlorophyta.  If successful, this research would permit the direct              incorporation of fossil materials into phylogenetic analyses.  The              ability to isolate and analyze DNA from fossil specimens would                  therefore provide: (1) a control for phylogenetic inferences based              on modern taxa; (2) an opportunity to calibrate the phylogenetic                trajectories that have been hypothesized; and (3) the chance that               precursors could be fit into the phylogenetic framework.  It is                 unclear if extraction of fossil DNA can be accomplished routinely,              and there is some skepticism based on structural and theoretical                grounds that it is not feasible to expect good returns of fossil                DNA.  Also, it is unclear whether chloroplast and nuclear DNAs will             be equally extractable (there is a possibility that cpDNA is less               labile since it is borne within the chlorplast membrane).  This                 research will focus on a rich and diverse fossil bed in Idaho.",
