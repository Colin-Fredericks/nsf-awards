 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most research on the relationship between social forces and the                 evolution of the legal profession focuses on the practice of law                in corporate law firms.  This study departs from this traditional               focus to investigate the changing nature of the legal profession                from the perspective of advocacy lawyering.  Focusing on legal                  rights lawyers and left activist lawyers, it investigates how                   lawyers operating at the margins of the legal profession respond                to the norms and ideology of the legal profession.  In addition,                the research discerns whether there are differences in the                      political ideology and professional norms of legal rights lawyers               in comparison to activist lawyers who practice law with the                     explicit goal of advancing the interests of the political left.                 Also, it explores how shifts in the larger society influence both               types of advocacy lawyering.                                                                                                                                    Focusing on a sample of lawyers affiliated with the Seattle                     membership of the National Lawyers Guild and a sample of attorneys              working with local legal rights organizations in the Seattle area,              the researchers employ an interview protocol to explore                         relationships among social change, different forms of advocacy                  lawyering, and the norms of the legal profession.  In addition to               broadening research on the transformation of the legal profession,              the study offers new insights into the ongoing public and                       professional debates about the efficacy of rights as a means of                 promoting social change in the United States.",
