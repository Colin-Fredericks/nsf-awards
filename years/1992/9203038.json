 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many studies have shown that air pollutants, including                     acidic deposition, can affect plants in ways which may be either                deleterious or beneficial to phytophagous insects.  However, the                biochemical and nutritional basis of such potential effects have                not been established.  This represents a crucial gap in our                     understanding of the impact of air pollution on plants, as well                 as our knowledge of the role of host plant quality in insect                    plant interactions.                                                                  The P.I. hypothesizes that acidic deposition causes                        qualitative and/or quantitative biochemical changes in red spruce               foliage which alter its nutritional value for spruce budworm                    (SBW), Choristoneura fumiferana, thereby impacting the insect's                 growth, development, and survival.  This hypothesis will be                     tested by relating SBW performance to physical and nutritional                  characteristics of one of its hosts, red spruce, exposed to                     varying levels or natural and artificial acidic fog.                                 The results of this study will elucidate the biochemical and               nutritional bases of the effects of acidic air pollution on                     plant-insect interactions and will provide a better understanding               of the impact of these pollutants on forest ecosystems.",
