 "awd_abstract_narration": "The premier East African hominid site of Hadar recently                    reopened for research after a 15 year lapse.  Major geologic                    opportunities are offered by the Pliocene Hadar Formation because               of its setting along the tectonic margin between the Ethiopian                  Plateau and the Afar Depression with an outstanding badlands                    exposure that extends well beyond the studied site of Hadar.  We                will build a facies model of deposition for the formation pegged                to a very good stratigraphic/geochronologic framework.  The                     previous sedimentological work stressed stratigraphic correlation               and suggested only very generalized environments of deposition.                 Being just 50 km east of the presently 2.5 km high Plateau                      escarpment, these Pliocene deposits remarkably consist of 70% mud               units and only 30% sands.  Most of the muds are massive with                    incipient arid paleosols.  Minor laminated mud sequences were                   deposited in a lake we hypothesize transgressed from the east                   (central Afar).  While the massive mud sand sequence seems to                   represent deposits of a meandering river the sands are too                      laterally extensive and too gradational into cobble conglomerates               (westward toward the escarpment) to be explained by presently                   available meandering stream models.                                                  By delineating and mapping detailed subfacies, especially in               the sands and by cataloging lateral and vertical sequences and the              first systematic paleocurrent data, we can assess sandflat versus               various channelized flow options.  For the muds we hope to                      delineate paleosols of varying maturity, and whether  the lake was              saline or fresh.  Careful facies mapping along the several                      isochronal tuff surfaces will provide environmental mosaic                      time-slices across Hadar.  This research should provide:  (1) a                 significant segment of the history of the Afar tectonic boundary;               (2) knowledge of the environments where the hominids lived and were             preserved, and a strategy for exploring for them in the vast                    exposures east and west of Hadar, and; (3) a contribution toward                a general facies model for thick rapid alluvial deposition where                sheets sands exist in association with thick muds.",
