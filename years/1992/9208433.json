 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arabidopsis thaliana, or commonly known as mouse-ear cress, a              small European weed of the mustard family, to which the cabbages,               Brussel sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and radishes belong, has                become the model flowering plant in basic studies of classical and              molecular biology.  Thousands of biologists are working on this                 organism to understand many fundamental biological processes.                   Worldwide interest in mouse-ear cress stems from the fact that this             organism has the smallest and simplest genome among flowering                   plants, has a generation time of four to six weeks, and has a small             size to 30 cm high (because of its small size, dozens can be grown              in a small pot and several hundred thousands in a small room).                  These and several other attributes make the plant ideal for basic               studies in biology.  Yet the very basic information on Arabidopsis,             especially on its nearest relatives, limits, number of species, and             various aspects of its individual species is almost non-existent.               To understand the origin of this organism, basic systematic studies             on the genus are urgently needed, and living material of all taxa               should be made available.  The proposed research is designed to                 address these very problems.                                                         Intensive field work will be done in central Asia, especially              the adjacent portions of China, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan,                   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which represent the center              of greatest diversity of the genus.  Seed collections will be                   deposited at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio                 State, where they will be made available to botanists worldwide.                Extensive systematic studies based on herbarium material from more              than 80 herbaria will be conducted, and detailed studies on the                 morphology, reproductive biology, cytology, seed anatomy, and                   chemistry of Arabidopsis and its relatives will be done.  The                   proposed two-year grant will result in a systematic study of                    Arabidopsis and will provide the scientific community with much                 needed living material of the various species including mouse-ear               cress.",
