 "awd_abstract_narration": "Android software is widely used in smartphones, tablets, and various\r\nother devices. In devices with limited resources, an application that\r\nconsumes too many resources can lead to slowdowns, crashes, and\r\nnegative user experience. Software defects related to leaking of\r\nresources are widespread and varied, but there does not exist a\r\ncomprehensive strategy for testing and debugging of such leaks.\r\nAnother common problem in Android software is when an application\r\ntakes too long to respond to a user action, in which case it is\r\nperceived as sluggish and of low quality. There do not exist testing\r\ntechniques or tools for exposing the underlying software defects\r\nleading to poor responsiveness.\r\n\r\nResource leaks and poor responsiveness can have severe effects on\r\nsoftware reliability, performance, and marketplace success. This\r\nproject develops LeakDroid, a novel approach and toolset for testing\r\nand debugging of such defects. Static code analyses are used to\r\nextract precise GUI models of Android applications; such analyses are\r\nessential for many algorithms for program understanding, optimization,\r\ntesting, and debugging. Next, GUI tests are generated based on common\r\nleak patterns, through sequences of GUI events that should not lead to\r\nincreases in resource usage. Poor responsiveness is exposed with tests\r\nthat introduce delays at chosen code locations. Debugging techniques\r\nare then employed to find leaking data structures and poor\r\nresponsiveness operations, as well as the corresponding defective\r\ncode. These contributions advance the state of the art in the\r\nimportant area of analysis, testing, and debugging for Android\r\nsoftware. When these advances and tools become part of software\r\ndevelopment practices, they would result in lower costs and increased\r\nquality applications for millions of users of mobile devices. The\r\neducational efforts of the project develop the skills of the next\r\ngeneration of creators of mobile software",
