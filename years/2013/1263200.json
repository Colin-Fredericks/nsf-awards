 "awd_abstract_narration": "------------\r\n\r\nA Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the United Tribes Technical College (UTTC), which will provide research training for 8 students for 10 weeks and 4 science teachers, for each of the summers 2014-2016. Participants will conduct environmental ecology research critical to Tribal lands in the Northern plains, under the guidance of mentors from UTTC (Bismarck, ND), Ft. Berthold Community College (New Town, ND), Sitting Bull College (Ft. Yates, ND), Oglala Lakota College (Kyle, SD), Augustana College (Sioux Falls, SD), and North Dakota State University (Fargo, ND). Participants will be involved in research focusing on restoration ecology, insect behavior and ecological impacts, integrated bison prairie management, effects of oil development of natural resources, conservation biology, and geospatial applications in ecological research. Undergraduates are recruited from across the Northern Plains, with a focus on tribal college students, and are selected based on expressed interest, demonstrated skills, and dedication to science careers. Participants will conduct individual research projects as part of a larger research team and will receive training in research ethics, project design, field and laboratory techniques, and analysis and presentation of results. Science teachers (grades 6-12) are recruited from reservation school systems and will conduct fieldwork alongside the REU participants. Teachers will develop curriculum modules based on their research experiences for their own classrooms and provide the modules to other teachers. Shared orientation week, a midpoint camping trip, and final presentations develop teamwork among the participants. Students will be encouraged to present at regional and national conferences and to publish their result in scientific journals. Participants are evaluated using the common assessment tool for biology REU programs. The program increases the recruitment, retention, and degree completion of Native American students in science, while providing a solid foundation for these students to be successful in graduate programs. More information is available by visiting https://www.uttc.edu/about/forum/reu/, or by contacting the program director, Dr. Jeremy Guinn at jguinn@uttc.edu or 701-255-3285 x1458.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFrom 2014-2017, the Tribal College REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program provided 10-week research immersion programs for 29 predominately Native American undergraduate students from Tribal Colleges.  The summer program allowed students to conduct ecological and biological research on issues of concern to their home reservations, while obtaining training on cutting edge technologies and bolstering their professional skills.  The project produced four cohorts of Native American scientists who are prepared for entering the workforce or continuing on to advanced degrees in research fields.  Graduates are gaining employment in STEM related fields and obtaining advanced degrees in STEM graduate programs.  The project also enhanced the STEM pipeline by providing research training, exposure to local research, and teaching modules for twelve STEM K-12 teachers through the Tribal College RET (Research Experience for Teachers) program.  A multi-site program, spread across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Oklahoma, expanded our impacts to rural areas across the plains.    \n\nAll participants designed a research question, collected and analyzed data, and provided a professional research presentation at a public symposium.  K-12 Teachers produced local research-based teaching modules for their classrooms.  Conducting ecological research on reservations often means that they were working in an understudied region or obtaining observations of species or systems for which there was little published information.  Data collected by students have helped to better understand coyote movement in a mid-sized city surrounded by agriculture, identify predators of several agricultural insect pest species, develop habitat prediction models for a species of conservation concern, identify antibacterial properties of traditional medicinal plants as alternative to commercial antibiotics, identify pollinator regimes at restoration sites, and evaluate cattle integration into bison genetic profiles.  These contributions to local communities have immediate and lasting impacts.  Additional participant training was provided during a suite of professional development workshops with topics such as Responsible Conduct of Research, Experimental Design and Replication, Working on a Team, Bringing Your \"A\" Game to Work, Resumes and CVs, Applying for Federal Jobs or Graduate School, Data Management, and Designing Oral and Poster Presentations. \n\nThe Tribal College REU/RET program has grown partnerships and research collaborations with natural resource agencies and research universities, improving communication, joint training opportunities, and access to graduate programs for Native American students.  The REU has also changed the perception of tribal colleges and tribal college students due to networking, expanded interactions with local landowners, and delivery of high-quality presentations and outreach programs.  Tribal Colleges now routinely work with graduate students, faculty from research universities, and agency professionals as equal collaborating partners. \n\nThe Tribal College REU program successfully brought the benefits and opportunities of the NSF?s REU program to students who would have not otherwise been able to participate in this highly successful program.  The Tribal College REU/RET programs have improved the STEM pipeline for underrepresented groups while improving economic and scientific capacity for the region and local tribal communities.  Student projects have pushed Tribal College labs to improve infrastructure, equipment, and mastery of advanced techniques.  The REU program has enhanced student self-efficacy and self-identity as scientists.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy E Guinn"
