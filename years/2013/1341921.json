ICS is a highly regarded international technical conference with a multi-disciplinary focus on high-end computing for scientific and engineering applications.  The funds will help support U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend ICS. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.",
