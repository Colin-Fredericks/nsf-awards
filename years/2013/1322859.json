 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate projections of future relative sea-level (RSL) rise are crucial for effective management of coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems including salt marshes. Sea-level reconstructions from the last 4000 years provide a context for understanding modern and projected rates of sea-level rise because Earth's climate system is relatively unchanged.  We will develop two new proxy RSL reconstructions from North Carolina to identify positive and negative departures from the perceived stability of sea level during the last 4000 years and support development of new predictive models in which the sea level-climate relationship can vary through time. The reconstructions will test the widely held assumption that sea-level rise from melting of large ice sheets was negligible during the last 2000 years and will help constrain rates of vertical land level movement. Data generated for the reconstructions will be used to further develop a model of salt-marsh response to sea-level rise that will provide a valuable service and tool to the coastal management community for informing policy decisions.  \r\n\r\nWhile there are compilations of global and regional proxy temperature data for the late Holocene, little is known about sea-level variability during this period and the response of sea level to known climate deviations such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and 20th century warming is unknown. Using foraminifera preserved in North Carolina salt-marsh sediments, we will produce the first continuous, high resolution (decadal and decimeter) RSL reconstruction spanning the last ~4000 years. The sea-level reconstructions will calibrate new predictive models of sea-level rise to improve the accuracy and regional validity of projections. The new record will extend existing reconstructions to test the following hypotheses that are vital for understanding the climate sea-level relationship: (1) regional RSL was stable before AD 1000; and (2) the contribution from melting of large ice sheets sea-level rise ended 2000 years ago. Reconstructions derived from salt marsh sediment also provide a paleo perspective for predicting the ecological effects of future sea-level rise. The proxy sea-level record will validate, for the first time, the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM). The MEM describes the regulation of salt-marsh vegetation by changes in sea level. If sea-level rise is faster than the rate of salt-marsh sediment accretion, the productivity of salt-marsh vegetation will decline, resulting in the degradation or loss of these important coastal ecosystems. The proxy sea level record will test a central premise of the MEM that (3) Stable sediment organic matter (SOM) concentration varies inversely with the reconstructed rate of RSL-rise.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this research was to test a model of tidal marsh response to sea-level rise (the Marsh Equilibrium Model) against an existing batch of data from the Cedar Island marsh in Pamlico Sound, NC.  The existing data are from a 5-foot core of marsh sediment that was radiocarbon dated at multiple depths.  Fossil Foraminifera in sections core had previously been analyzed to give an estimate of the elevation of the paleo marsh surface relative to past water levels.  The core had also been analyzed for organic carbon content.  The model calculates the organic carbon content of the soil based upon the elevation of the marsh surface relative to the current water level.  Using a technique known as inverse modeling we were able to compute the paleo marsh elevation by fitting the model to the organic carbon content at different intervals of the core, all dated previously.  We found good agreement between the model fit and previous estimates of paleo marsh elevation obtained from analyses of fossil Foraminifera.  After calibrating the model in this manner we ran the model forward into the future to forecast the marsh response to sea-level rise.  The model predicts that the marsh will be stable against a constant rise in sea level amounting to 3 mm/yr (0.12 inches per year), but additional increases in rate will probably drown the marsh.  A rise of 31 inches in 100 years (well within current estimates of sea-level rise) will likely drown the marsh before the end of the 21st century.  This is important because coastal wetlands provide benefits to society such as provision of food and nursery habitat for commercially important fin and shell fishes, water purification, carbon sequestration, and partial protection of coastal infrastructure from storm surge.  As existing marshes drown the loss of these services will be offset to some extent by migration of marshes to higher ground, but the marsh in this study is an island with nowhere to migrate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James T Morris"
