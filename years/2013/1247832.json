 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications\" will be held May 28-31, 2013 at the City College of New York. This conference will be devoted to the study of a variety of topics in geometric and asymptotic group theory, with special emphasis on statistical methods, interactions with theoretical computer science, and applications to information security. The conference will include leading specialists in various aspects of the geometric, asymptotic, and algorithmic group theory. More specifically, this includes: group actions, quasi-isometries, growth, asymptotic invariants, random walks, algorithmic problems and their complexity.\r\n\r\nGeometric and asymptotic group theory is an essential part of modern mathematics. It interfaces with a number of important areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, including low-dimensional topology (essential in modern physics), geometry, graph theory, combinatorics, complexity theory, and information theory, in particular information security. The synergistic effect of the interactions between people in these areas that the conference will promote has the potential to result in new long-term collaborations and advances in research.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stevens.edu/algebraic/GAGTA/index.htm",
