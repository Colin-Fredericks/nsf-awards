 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops mathematical and computational approaches for big data exploitation. Fast and online\r\nalgorithms that learn and adapt as data arrives and changes are developed. How to automatically\r\nunderstand and reduce redundancy in the data, for a given task, is also addressed in this project. Big data\r\ncomes in multiple forms, e.g., audio and video, audio and text, video and weather, video from multiple\r\nsources, brain imaging from multiple modalities, friendship networks and individual preferences. This is\r\nalso addressed in this project. The broad impact of the research is born in the large and diverse\r\napplicability of big data and in the techniques here developed. In the education arena, the developed\r\nInternet classes have an audience of tens of thousands, and the project provides unique integration of\r\nresearch and undergraduate education via different Duke initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe framework follows the parsimony theory of sparse modeling. Challenges are addressed with a gamechanging\r\nparadigm: learning to optimize; on-line learning what the task-dependent optimizer is expected\r\nto do, developing computationally efficient algorithms to approximate the ideal behavior of sometimes\r\nunknown optimizers. The work derives novel multi-modal formulations for network inference, and realtime\r\non-line robust PCA and robust NMF, fundamental tools in big data modeling and exploitation; as\r\nwell as robust 3D shape, networks, and multi-modal matching. The formulation elegantly solves bilevel\r\noptimization problems rendering it efficient for classification and signal separation tasks. Sparse\r\nmodeling is extended to new venues and algorithms, making such techniques usable for big data. The\r\nformulations and theoretical foundations are complemented with numerous applications.",
