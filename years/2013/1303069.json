 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry to be held at the University of Miami, Florida, from January 28 - February 1, 2013.  More information can be found on the conference website: http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/miami2013.html\r\n\r\nWhile mirror symmetry initially arose from phenomena in string theory, this active area at the interface between mathematics and physics has been shown to be relevant to numerous mathematical structures.  In particular, methods from Lagrangian intersection theory and Floer homology theory, integrable systems and wall-crossing, derived and higher categories, and non-commutative Hodge structures are all intimately connected with homological mirror symmetry.  The wide range of topics in homological mirror symmetry research necessitates venues such as this, particularly for early-career researchers to be introduced to and stay abreast of current topics. The main topics of this conference will be wall crossing, stability Hodge structures and topological quantum field theories. There will be 3 lecture courses, by M. Kontsevich, by M. Abouzaid and by S. Keel. There will be two discussion sessions. \r\n\r\nThe conference will result in dissemination of results and getting a young wave of researchers to join these projects. All considerations on giving opportunities to underrepresented groups were taken. The conference will also serve to facilitate interactions between US-based researchers and international participants who will be attended the conference.  This will be particularly beneficial for US-based graduate students and should lead to a fruitful exchange of ideas among representatives of many mathematical communities. In addition, the conference will be a means of \"giving back to physics.\" Many of the ideas at the beginning of the subject come from String theory - Mirror Symmetry. It is time for the mathematical aspect to give back to physics. The singularities on the discriminant loci we study correspond to a new physics theory of 6d type.  In this way the circle comes to a close.",
