Student participation in SoCS encourages young investigators in their research in combinatorial search. This symposium carries on a tradition of bringing together researchers and students around issues of pattern-database heuristics, inconsistent heuristics, real-time search, path-finding for physical robots and computer-game agents, parallel search, and search using external memory. These search techniques have a significant place in broader AI application in areas such as robotics, computer games, planning, and bioinformatics. In addition, SoCS 13 includes a special focus on graph search engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of this project was to provide partial financial support for U.S.-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Sixth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2013) in Leavenworth, Washington, from July 11 to 13, 2013.\n\n.Combinatorial search is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is a\nsubfield of computer science.  It deals with problems where there a very large\nnumber of possible actions that can be taken to solve a problem, and the task is to find the best possible action sequence.  Examples include finding a route in a road network from an initial location to a goal location, or playing a game such as Chess, Checkers, or Go.\n\nThe Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is the primary scientific meeting in this field.  As such, it plays the usual roles of a scientific meeting.  It provides a forum for authors to present their latest research results to the\ncommunity, for researchers to learn about the latest results, and perhaps most importantly, provides opportunities for researchers to meet one another\nface-to-face, facilitating technical discussions and future collaborations on\nresearch. \n\nThese opportunities are particularly important for the professionsl\ndevelopment of the youngest members of the field, undergraduate and graduate students.  This grant was used to provide financial support to allow such students to attend the symposium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard E Korf"
