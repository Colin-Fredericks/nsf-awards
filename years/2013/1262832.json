 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to San Jos\u00e9 State University to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2013-2016.  Our proposed REU program at San Jos\u00e9 State University called Research by Undergraduates using Molecular Biology Applications (RUMBA) will focus its efforts in increasing the number of underrepresented minority doing biological research in the Silicon Valley.  Our REU Program will focus on the theme of molecular biology applications in biological research.  Ten faculty members with expertise in the areas of genetics, molecular evolution, molecular environmental microbiology, cell & molecular biology, and forensics will mentor students.  Regardless of the research laboratory placement, RUMBA students will comprise a cohort with shared thematic training experiences.  The cohort experiences will consist of the following: (1) molecular biology techniques training, (2) a bi-weekly formal group research meeting, (3) an ethics seminar, and (4) a culminating research symposium.  Students will be recruited from San Jos\u00e9 State University and other undergraduate institutions with high enrollment of female and underrepresented minority students.  Priority will be given to students of underrepresented groups as defined by NSF (African American, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander). We will utilize the following selection criteria for RUMBA participants: a GPA of at least 3.0, completion of the first year university biology and chemistry core course sequence, two letters of recommendation, and the quality of a personal statement.  Student applicants will be interviewed by RUMBA faculty before a decision is made.  A common web-based assessment instrument available to BIO-funded REU PIs will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our program.  Student participants will also be tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. San Jos\u00e9 State University (SJSU), the oldest public university in the state of California, is located in downtown San Jos\u00e9 and in the heart of Silicon Valley.  It is a metropolitan university with an enrollment of approximately 27,000 students. Students interested in participating in the RUMBA should contact Dr. Julio G. Soto, Professor, Biological Sciences Department, julio.soto@sjsu.edu.  Application forms and deadlines can be found on our web site:  http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Biology/RUMBA/RUMBA.html.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough the NSF REU RUMBA (Research for Undergraduates with Molecular Biology Applications) summer research program during the period of this grant, we have trained approximately 10 undergraduate students each summer in the practice of scientific research.  Students gained research experience through carrying out research projects in laboratories in the Departments of Biological Science and Chemistry at San Jose State University (SJSU).  Gaining research experience at the undergraduate level is critical for aspiring scientists, but is not always a possibility at a student?s home institution.  Therefore, our program accepted students from around the United States, as well as from SJSU.  Funding from the NSF allowed us to support students financially, allowing students from low-income families to participate.  In line with NSF?s goal of bringing underrepresented minority students into science, the majority of students in our program were from underrepresented minorities.\n\nThere were three components of the summer research program.  The first component consisted of mentored research projects.  Students each had their own research projects, and were mentored in learning the approaches and techniques necessary to pursue their questions by faculty and senior students in their laboratories.  Students worked on projects in molecular and cellular neuroscience, cancer research, bacterial genetics, protein engineering and other disciplines.  Students made great progress, learning molecular and genetic techniques which are pervasive throughout our fields.  Perhaps more importantly, they learned how to ask an important question and form hypotheses, how to design experiments to test their hypotheses, and how to analyze and interpret the data they collected.  No matter what discipline they eventually choose, these skills will be critical.\n\nThe second component of the summer research program consisted of weekly workshops with the cohort of REU student researchers that focused on science communication.  Students learned to present their ongoing scientific research to a broad audience using PowerPoint presentations.  They also learned to write abstracts describing their research, which they submitted to national conferences.  Students also learned to make posters that presented their scientific findings, which almost all students were able to present at national conferences, such as the annual SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) conference.  This was an important experience for students, because scientific conferences are one of the primary ways that biology is communicated among scientists.  In addition to presenting their own work, students were then exposed to research from around the country, and got a chance to network with students and faculty at many top research universities.\n\nThe third component of the summer research program consisted of engagement with other REU programs around the San Francisco Bay Area through a joint ethics workshop, which was hosted at U. C. Berkeley.  Students enjoyed and appreciated the experience to learn about ethics in scientific research through this interactive workshop. They engaged in different activities involving different examples that tested their ability to apply what they had learned.  They also enjoyed the opportunity to interact with students and faculty in different REU programs and learn about the different research areas and institutions.  Toward this goal, we also attended symposiums at which students from each of the San Francisco Bay Area REU programs gave talks on their research.  These were well-attended by faculty as well, and proved to be wonderful educational experiences for the students, and good preparation for national conferences. \n\nThrough these three components, we have provided our cohorts of students with the skills and experiences that they need to pursue careers in science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miri Vanhoven"
