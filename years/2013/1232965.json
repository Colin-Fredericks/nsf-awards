The meeting will be held at the Memorial Union of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from Sunday, July to 14 to Friday, July 19, 2013. There will be ten plenary lectures by national and international invited speakers. A total of 313 contributed papers have been submitted and they will be distributed among six parallel oral sessions in each of four daily periods, and a poster session. Oral sessions will include: Medical/Biological Applications; Industrial Applications; Blast Waves; Chemically Reacting Flows; Detonation and Combustion; Facilities; Flow Visualization; Hypersonic Flow; Impact and Compaction/Condensed Matter Physics; Ignition; Magnetohydrodynamics/Plasmas; Multiphase Flow; Nozzle Flow; Numerical Methods; Propulsion; Shock Waves and Rarefied Flows; Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability; Shock/Boundary Layer Interaction; Shock Propagation, Reflection; Shock Vortex Interaction. Some of the oral sessions will be reserved for a \"student competition\" whose winner will receive an award for best paper. The funds for the awards will be provided by the International Shock Wave Institute.",
