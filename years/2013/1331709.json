 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hallmark of bilingual language processing is the parallel activation of the two languages during the use of only one language in production comprehension. In order to select a word in a single language from the myriad of co-activated words, bilinguals exploit an exquisite mechanism of language control that may come to affect cognitive and executive function. However, the exact nature of this mechanism is unknown. With National Science Foundation support, Mr. Jason Gullifer will collect data for his dissertation under the direction of Drs. Judith Kroll and Paola Dussias. Using an array of experimental methodologies, including behavioral and electrophysiological measures, Gullifer and colleagues will investigate whether differences in sentence structure between English and Spanish can function as a cue enabling bilingual speakers of those two languages to make a language choice during comprehension. Reaction times to name words in the context of sentences and brain potentials time-locked to the presentation of those words will be used to test the hypothesis that structural differences between languages can influence the degree of language co-activation. An independent behavioral experiment utilizing a method to measure cross-language syntactic priming will be used to determine the degree of representational overlap of each of the structures between Spanish and English, revealing the relationship between the degree of cross-language overlap and language co-activation.\r\n\r\nThe funded research has a number of broader impacts. Increasing diversity makes it important to learn a second language to enhance communication. The biological basis of second language learning was identified in 2005 in the AAAS publication 'Science' as one of the top 125 questions for scientific inquiry over the next quarter-century. The proposed research informs language learning by advancing models of language comprehension and production. Learning a second language also confers benefits to cognition, and the funded research will identify one mechanism by which language selection is achieved, helping to answer the question of how bilingualism impacts cognition. The proposed research includes a component for the mentorship of undergraduate research assistants by involving individuals who have been historically underrepresented in scientific research.",

If multiple language alternatives are activated, how does a bilingual settle upon the intended alternative without interference from the unintended language? Recent psycholinguistic and neuroscience approaches have argued for the existence of a cognitive control mechanism in the form of inhibition of the unintended language, and an emerging literature suggests that lifelong experience using cognitive control to mitigate language competition may generalize from the realm of language control to broader aspects of cognitive control. Yet, very little is known about precisely how language control comes to impact general cognitive function. One possibility is that features of linguistic input that are specific to one of a bilingual's two languages could function to restrict activation to that language. For example, languages of the world use different word orders (or syntactic constructions) to represent similar ideas. The question addressed here is whether syntactic constructions that are unique to Spanish can allow a group highly fluent bilinguals (native language: Spanish; second language: English) to select the intended language and ignore the unintended language.<br /><br />The first step of the project was to identify a structure that has a unique word order in Spanish apart from English and may be functionally distinct between the two languages. The approach taken was to exploit evidence from a research paradigm known as cross-language syntactic priming. Syntactic priming is a phenomenon whereby a syntactic structure that was just heard by a listener comes to influence the way later sentences with the same structures are produced or understood. For example, if a listener hears a speaker use a passive sentence (e.g., The boy was hit by the baseball), the listener is more likely to be primed and use the passive structure in their own speech to describe a new action (e.g., The church was struck by lightning). The priming phenomenon happens across languages in bilingual speakers, so a passive used in Spanish will increase the likelihood of passive use in English. This suggests that the passive structures are shared in some way between the two languages. Crucially, this cross-language phenomenon depends on whether structures share word order between the two languages; when the two languages exhibit different word orders, priming is less likely suggesting that the two structures are functionally distinct. According to cross-language syntactic priming research, dative sentences which exhibit different word orders between Spanish and English should be represented in a distinct manner for Spanish-English bilinguals.
