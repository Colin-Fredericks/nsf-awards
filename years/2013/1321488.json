The GRC is the 9th in a series of Gordon Research Conferences that focus on the structure, dynamics and evolution of the Earth's interior. For the second time, the Gordon Conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (http://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?year=2013&program=grs_inter), a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas. NSF funds will be used to attract young scientists to the\r\nGRC and GRS, from a diverse range of institutions, backgrounds and scientific disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming conference will focus on the deep Earth and will cover, among others, the structure, composition and dynamics of the core-mantle boundary region and the core, magnetic field, planets, as well as structure and geochemical evolution of the whole Earth, from a multidisciplinary perspective. Invited speakers from the fields of geochemistry, geodynamics, mineral physics, geomagnetism and seismology will define the forefront of knowledge and set the stage for a freewheeling discussion and debate of the most pressing scientific questions. Specific session topics include inner core structure and dynamics, the structure and nature of LLSVP's (large low shear velocity provinces), the mantle transition zone and interactions between the upper and the lower mantle, early earth and geochemical reservoirs, rheology and mineralogy of the deep mantle, the core-mantle boundary and core/mantle interactions, planetary interiors. The conference will also provide the opportunity for junior scientists and graduate students to present their work in poster format and exchange ideas with leading researchers. The latter will be greatly facilitated by the preceding GRS, which will focus on 'Structure of the Earth's Deep Interior and its Role in Mantle Convection\", providing particular synergy with the GRC to follow. The collegial atmosphere of both GRC and GRS, with programmed discussion sessions and opportunities for informal gatherings, is intended to generate lively exchange and promote cross-disciplinary collaborations.",
