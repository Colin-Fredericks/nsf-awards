 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geographic distribution of many plants is shaped by long distance dispersal (LDD) across oceans and unsuitable habitats, typically by wind currents. Geographic distributions that do not correlate with wind paths and the occurrence of widely distributed species not suited for wind dispersal suggests, however, that dispersal may be accomplished by other means, such as by migratory birds. Our knowledge of LDD and thus its affect on shaping global floristic diversity is limited to model cases where wind paths are available for organisms with high dispersal ability. Lewis and Goffinet will use revolutionary genome sequencing techniques, to reconstruct non-model global dispersal histories and assess the frequency and significance of these events on the biodiversity of pristine high latitude regions.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding the processes that shape biodiversity allow us to better understand how the ecosystems we know have come to be, and how they may change. High latitude regions represent some of the world?s most pristine ecosystems, but also the most vulnerable ones to global climate change. In conjunction with the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of Southernmost Chile, Lewis and Goffinet are integrating scientific investigation, in-situ conservation, community education, and ecotourism to introduce the public to high latitude bryophyte diversity and contribute to our understanding of these organisms, their ecosystems, and global plant dispersal.",
