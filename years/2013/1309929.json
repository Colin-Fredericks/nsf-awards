These are lanthanide or actinide intermetallic compounds in which the close vicinity to magnetic instability gives rise to fundamentally new kinds of electronic material behavior.  \r\n\r\nMotivated by many new experimental results, a theoretical study of the break-down of conventional metallic behavior that occurs in a quantum critical heavy fermion metal will be carried out.  This will involve developing theoretical models for the \"intrinsic\" quantum criticality recently discovered in Ytterbium rare earth heavy fermion systems YbBAl3 and YbAuAl. Specifically, the research is aimed to develop a mixed boson-fermion theoretical framework to describe the co-existence of localized magnetism and delocalized heavy electron behavior that is observed to occur in various Cerium-based heavy electron materials.\r\n\r\nA second part of the research will study the development of novel forms of electronic order in heavy-electron materials. The PI will develop theoretical models for the 115 heavy fermion superconductors to understand the entanglement of the local moment spin degrees of freedom with the pair condensate, described by \"composite pairing\", and the unusual robustness of these superconductors against pair breaking.  This research will also study the phenomenon of hidden order URu2Si2 and analogous praseodymium heavy electron materials. \r\n\r\n\r\nNON TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to study the fundamental origins of new kinds of order in heavy fermion materials. \r\n\r\nElectrons in metals interact with one another via their mutual Coulomb repulsion. When these interactions become large, the conventional metallic state becomes unstable and the electrons organize themselves via a phase transition, into new states of order. Ordered states include familiar ferro-magnets in which the intrinsic magnetism of each of the electrons is aligned, anti-ferromagnets, in which the magnetic order is staggered in space, and superconductors in which electrons form of a fluid of Cooper pairs which flows without resistance.  These new states bring new kinds of materials properties, such as the fierce magnetism used for hybrid car motors, or the zero resistance of a high temperature superconductor.  \r\n\r\nPhase transitions that occur at the absolute zero of temperature are entirely driven by the zero-point quantum motion of the electrons; there is no thermal motion. Through quantum phase transitions, metals develop new forms of electronic order.  In many quantum phase transitions, the transition to order is preceded by a point where the quantum mechanical jiggling of the emergent order becomes very intense, spreading throughout the entire metal.  This kind of \"Quantum Criticality\" develops when the phase transition temperature is tuned to absolute zero. \r\n\r\nThis award supports research to advance current understanding of the transformations in metallic behavior induced near a magnetic quantum critical point. The research will be focused on \"heavy fermion\" materials, whose properties make them highly tunable for the study of quantum criticality.  The PI aims to develop a new mathematical framework to describe the transformation in the magnetic character of the electrons at a quantum critical point, as they transform from mobile waves to localized magnetic moments. \r\n\r\nA second part of this research concerns the new kinds of electronic order that develop in heavy fermion materials near a magnetic instability.  The PI will focus in part on heavy fermion superconductors, which display in miniature, much of the physics observed in high temperature transition metal superconductors. Normal superconductivity develops in response to the formation of Cooper pairs between electrons. This research will refine the concept of \"composite pairs\", whereby magnetic moments bind to electron pairs to form a \"composite pair\" that drives superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThe PI will also investigate the phenomenon of \"hidden order\" observed to develop as a precursor to superconductivity in the heavy fermion compound Uranium Ruthenium-2 Silicon-2 . The PI seeks to generalize the concepts that underlie a new kind of order he has proposed, called hastatic order, and to understand its relationship to the superconductivity that develops with the hidden order. The possibility that similar types of order can occur in closely related intermetallic materials will be examined.",

One material of particular interest is the layered heavy fermion superconductor YbBAl4. Above its tiny 60mK transition temperature, this&nbsp; material is &ldquo;intrinsically quantum critical&rdquo; at ambient pressure and exhibits strange metal behavior.<br />With our collaborators at the university of Tokyo, we have discovered that the<br />quantum critical behavior of YbBAl_4 survives up to 40kbar of pressure,<br />showing that the strange metal is a phase (Fig 1.)&nbsp; Moreover,<br />this criticality is not driven by magnetic instabilities, since magnetism only develops around 100kbar[1]. Our tentative theory for this strange metallic behavior in terms of a kind of&nbsp; \"tornado\" topological structure in the momentum-dependence of the electron kinetic energies (called the Hamiltonian). &nbsp; As part of this research, we were able to show that recent microwave experiments (&ldquo;ESR&rdquo; experiments) could be understood in terms of our theory[2].<br /><br />A&nbsp;&nbsp; seoncd outcome concerns our quest to develop a unified understanding of the magnetic quantum critical point. Quantum particles belong to two basic families -&nbsp; bosons and fermions.&nbsp; Unusually, magnetic moments behave as bosons in a magnetic phase, but as fermions in a non magnetic or&nbsp; \"Fermi liquid\" phase.&nbsp; This has led to a suspicion that the quantum critical point might be a special point where spins develop both bosonic and fermionic qualities. Such a point would be supersymmetric, and we might then be able to account for the novel properties of the quantum critical point as a result of the low energy modes of a \"supersymmetric\" ground-state.&nbsp; In our research we have examined this this fascinating possibility by developing a theory of supersymmetric quantum spins. Unlike previous theories of heavy fermions, in which the character of the excitations was set by the physicist, in this theory, the energetics of the ground-state determine whether the excitations are magnetic bosons or electronic fermions.&nbsp; In an exploratory application of this theory, we have explored a simple two and three magnetic heavy fermion problem.

We intend to extend this work to a lattice of local moments in future research.<br /><br />Another active&nbsp; area of&nbsp; condensed matter research is the application of ideas of topology. This has led to a revolution of understanding, recognized in part by the 2016 Nobel prize to Thouless, Kosterlitz and Haldane. A third outcome of our work concerns a&nbsp; the nature of&nbsp; <em>semi-metallic </em>heavy fermion states: these are heavy fermion metals with a very low low density of electrons. The most famous heavy fermion semi-metal is an intermetallic compound CeNiSn.&nbsp; An early theory of this material had proposed that its unusual semi-metallic behavior is associated with a \"vortex\" in the&nbsp; Kinetic energy dependence on momentum, similar though less violent than in YbAlB4 mentioned above.&nbsp; To test this idea, the PI worked with exoerimentalists in Vienna, Austria who measured the&nbsp; Nernst effect - the deflection of a heat flow carried by a current in a magnetic field. One of the quirks of this compound, is that although the current carrying properties are very anisotropic, the heat carrying properties are very isotropic.

We found[5]&nbsp; that non-symmorphic symmetries can give the Kondo semi-metal a topological ground-state, leading to the formation of protected surface states, called Mobius surface states(Fig. 2). When doped with antimony, CeNiSn develops a low temperature plateau in its resistivity, that we hypothesize derives from such surface states.
