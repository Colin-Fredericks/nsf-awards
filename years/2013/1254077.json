 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nAllosteric regulation is a central tenet of modern biochemistry, however, it is a mechanism that is still not well understood. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how allosteric and catalytic mechanisms work together in multi-domain enzymes.  This research examines the mechanistic and evolutionary interactions between two conserved domains in the context of the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily. An integrated experimental approach, including biochemical, structural, and bioinformatics techniques is used to (a) determine the identity of kinetic steps perturbed in allosteric inhibition, (b) predict and verify functional and structural diversity and (c) investigate the role of conserved residues in the allosteric mechanism. This type of approach overcomes several difficulties commonly encountered in the study of allosteric enzymes, moves away from the phenomenological description of different allosteric mechanisms and considers the impact of evolutionary pressures on the diversity of mechanisms within a conserved protein scaffold. Rapid-reaction kinetics and kinetic isotope effects will be used to investigate the changes to enzyme mechanisms caused by allosteric inhibitors. The creation of a protein similarity network for the model allosteric domain will provide rapid organization for a large number of diverse sequences predicted to contain the domain. High-throughput structural techniques will provide essential structural coverage for clusters of sequences currently lacking structural description. Mechanistic and structural data will be mapped onto the protein similarity network to define the functional and structural boundaries of the model allosteric domain. The integrated results will provide a description of structure/function relationships contributing to functional and allosteric diversity and also give insight into how a single protein scaffold evolves multiple allosteric mechanisms. The outcomes of this research will impact the growing areas of allosteric biosensors and metabolic engineering of bacterial strains for industrial uses. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project will promote interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students at The University of Alabama. Graduate student training will be enhanced by an on-site visit to the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Babbitt at the University of California, San Francisco for hands-on training in cutting edge bioinformatics techniques. Undergraduate training will be accomplished through two mechanisms designed to increase exposure to original hypothesis-based research. The first mechanism will provide multiple positions in the Frantom laboratory for undergraduate researchers from the University of Alabama Emerging Scholars to continue performing mentored research. The second mechanism is the creation of a formal undergraduate laboratory course to mimic key experiences encountered in undergraduate research. Students unable to participate in direct scientific research will benefit from a laboratory course built around performing original hypothesis-driven experiments that contribute directly to the intellectual merit of this project.",

To try and address this challenge, the field of genomic enzymology seeks to reframe structure/function relationships in enzyme function and mechanism with respect to large-scale sequence data rather than the study of a small handful of sequences which may not provide adequate representation. This proposal investigated diversity in the functional and regulatory mechanisms of enzymes in the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily by combining genomic enzymology with traditional mechanistic enzymology techniques. The DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily was selected as a target system for study due to the biological importance of family members and the conserved presence of allosteric regulatory mechanisms. This superfamily contains enzymes that catalyze the formation and breakage of carbon-carbon bonds. Family members are involved in many biological processes including amino acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism in plants. In terms of intellectual merit, several key outcomes resulted from the work. Cutting-edge bioinformatics were used to visualize the sequence landscape of the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily in a sequence similarity network. Construction of the network provided the foundation for investigation of evolutionary diversity in regulation and function of the superfamily. Importantly, it identified several evolutionary versions of the conserved enzyme isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS) as well as seven other associated functions in the enzyme scaffold. With respect to regulation, kinetic isotope and solvent viscosity effects were used to identify the discrete mechanistic step affected in the regulatory mechanism for several enzymes in the superfamily. This level of kinetic description for an allosteric mechanism remains rare and is essential for discrimination of competing mechanisms that present the same macroscopic regulatory patterns. We were able to show that evolutionarily distinct enzymes with low sequence similarity can utilize identical mechanisms of allosteric regulation. This result highlights the challenges associated with identifying structure/function relationships in allosteric enzymes. Attention then turned to diversity of function in the superfamily. Active-site fingerprints that could be used to predict function within a subgroup of enzymes in the superfamily were identified using the similarity network and experimentally validated. These results improved functional annotation for sequences with unknown function.
