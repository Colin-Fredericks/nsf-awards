The 2013\r\nSummer School on Formal Techniques continues the work of developing a\r\nwell-knit community of researchers who are interested in learning\r\ncutting-edge techniques in formal modeling and verification.\r\nAttendees at the school have the opportunity to present their own\r\nresearch ideas and to interact closely with both the lecturers and\r\nother students.",
