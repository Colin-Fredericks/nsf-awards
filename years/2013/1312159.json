 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a theoretical and numerical study of nonlinear interactions between waves and vortices in two subject areas: atmosphere ocean fluid dynamics relevant to climate science, and plasma physics relevant to tokamak dynamics and nuclear fusion. Common to these interaction problems are the huge inherent scale separations between the different dynamical components of the flow, which render a direct numerical simulation hopeless and which also introduce a stochastic component to the system dynamics because the small-scale components are only partially observable. Hence the study involves the mathematical investigation of various systems of multidimensional nonlinear PDEs using a combination of asymptotic analysis, stochastic modeling, and numerical computation, all with an eye towards ultimate applications in the real world that are relevant to climate science and nuclear fusion.  Specifically, the study consists of three projects. The first considers a special kind of small-scale internal gravity wave in the ocean and its interactions with mean currents near the sea floor, the second considers random particle motion induced by deep-ocean internal waves in the presence of forcing and dissipation, and the third investigates the wave-turbulence jigsaw puzzle posed by interactions between strong drift waves and strong zonal flows in the problem of plasma confinement in tokamaks.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere ocean dynamics relevant to climate science contains a vast span of active dynamical scales, from millimeters and milliseconds associated with sound waves to planetary scales and decades associated with large-scale ocean circulations, for example. All these scales are dynamically coupled together through a wide variety of nonlinear interactions and this is where fundamental mathematical theory can make a decisive contribution, namely by reducing these interactions into more tractable and understandable components that can then be simulated with significantly greater ease. Analogous comments apply to plasma dynamics that is relevant to fusion research and the behavior of tokamak devices. Hence, results from this theoretical study may feed into the future design of next generation atmosphere ocean forecasting systems for weather and climate, which is of great societal importance, and they should also strengthen the fundamental principles that feed into the design of nuclear fusion devices in tokamaks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe dynamic of the atmosphere and ocean system presents us with a complicated jig-saw puzzle in which many different kinds of fluid motion overlap and interact.  For example, focusing on the ocean there are many different wave modes, from the familiar surface waves on the top of the ocean to the less familiar internal gravity waves and internal tidal motions that exist thousands of meters below the surface.  Time scales associated with these waves range from a few seconds to a few days.  Superimposed on those are the slow meandering currents and the global-scale overturning circulation, with time scales reaching from week to months and in some cases up to many years.  Resolving all these different fluid motions over long time periods with a direct computer simulation of the full ocean is beyond the scope of even the most powerful supercomputers today, and this will remain the case for many years to come.  This is why theoretical investigations into atmosphere ocean fluid dynamics as pursued in this grant are crucial for our understanding of these complex system.  Only by understanding them can we predict their future behavior.\n\nOur work elucidated some of the ways in which ocean internal waves excited near the surface by passing storm systems can interact with the slower meandering currents in the deeper ocean.  Specifically, we used asymptotic mathematical analysis to derive equations that can describe these interactions and we subsequently tested our mathematical theory by direct computer simulation of idealized, simple configurations.  Such idealized simulations are much less costly than full simulations, and they are crucial in forming the basis for understanding the phenomena in play.  Results include the discovery of new interaction types between the waves and the currents that are relevant for energy exchanges over long time scales.  We also investigated the crucial role played by Coriolis forces, which are due to the Earth's rotation around the pole-to-pole axis, and whose significance varies great by latitude.     \n\nBy studiying these problems we contribute to the scientific foundations that underpin global-scale modelling of the atmosphere ocean system, in which processes of the kind we researched must be modelled \"by hand\", as they are beyond the resolving power of the computers.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oliver Buhler"
