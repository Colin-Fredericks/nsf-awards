 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit:  Eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, the membrane-bound organelles that produce energy for the cell.  Like the nucleus of the cell, mitochondria contain DNA genomes, whose maintenance without error is essential to the normal function of cells.  Deletions of large segments of the mitochondrial DNA are common mutations in many types of cells.  In many species, these mutations accumulate with age and are associated with metabolic syndromes.  Deletions of this type are also commonly observed in the mitochondrial DNA of baker's yeast.  The molecular tools available for research in yeast have made it a powerful model for the study of mitochondrial biology.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the fundamental cellular processes that contribute to mitochondrial deletion mutations.  Studies are directed at understanding the proteins involved in this process and their activities, as well as understanding the role of double-strand breaks in the generation of deletion mutations.  Completion of this work will provide information on the broad area of mitochondrial DNA transactions, including replication, recombination and repair.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  This work will have a positive impact on the education of undergraduates in the biological sciences at two institutions, as this project represents a collaborative effort between labs at two local universities.  Dr. Elaine Sia, at the University of Rochester, and Dr. Rey Sia, at SUNY-Brockport have a history of undergraduate mentorship of undergraduates in the laboratory, with a combined record of advising 20 undergraduates in independent study in the past 2.5 years.  Studies with yeast are well suited to undergraduates with little experience, allowing them to learn a large number of techniques and concepts in a summer or semester.  Special effort will continue to be made to recruit individuals from groups underrepresented in science, or first generation college students via connections with CSTEP/McNair, and summer REU programs.  The PI and co-PI continue to honor their commitment to scientific education with the involvement of undergraduate biology majors at SUNY Brockport and the University of Rochester in this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn addition to the DNA found in the nucleus, eukaryotic organisms have mitochondrial DNA.  Mitochondria produce cellular energy, and thus, altered mitochondrial function and failure to maintain functional mitochondrial DNA is associated with multiple human pathologies marked by dysfunction of highly energetic tissues, including: neurological disorders, diabetes, and muscle disorders.  Eukaryotic cells, both single- and multicellular, experience constant damage to mitochondrial DNA that results in mutation or loss of mitochondrial DNA in the absence of repair.  Understanding of the mechanisms of repair in mitochondria have lagged well behind comparable studies of nuclear repair, in spite of the importance in maintaining both genomes to cellular function.  Advancement in this area required the development of a useful model system, in which mitochondrial repair can be assessed.  Baker?s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has provided a powerful model system to develop an understanding of many other important mitochondrial functions including mitochondrial protein import and mitochondrial dynamics.  The ability to manipulate the yeast mitochondrial genome has allowed us to generate the important molecular and genetic tools to also assess mitochondrial DNA repair.\n\nDouble strand breaks are perhaps the most important types of DNA damage and result in genomic deletions, rearrangement, and genome loss.  Mitochondrial DNA deletions are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and aging in mammals.  The experiments performed under this award made use of yeast, the only organism in which these experiments can currently be performed, to identify proteins that are specifically involved in repair of mitochondrial double-strand breaks.  For the first time, the repair of a unique, directed double-strain break in mitochondrial DNA can be followed over time, allowing dissection of proteins that act at different steps in repair.  The evidence obtained supports a model in which some, but not all, of the well characterized nuclear double-strand break repair proteins act in the mitochondria as well.  These studies have revealed a role for a number of mitochondrial-specific proteins as well.  Thus, mitochondrial double-strand break repair pathways are comprised of proteins that are shared with the nucleus and mitochondrial-specific proteins.  It is likely that these observations will be more broadly applicable to organisms beyond yeast, since many of the same repair pathway components have been observed in the mitochondria of other organisms, including mammals, but their direct impact on double strand break repair could not be examined.\n\nThis project consisted of a collaboration between researchers at the University of Rochester and the College at Brockport (SUNY).  The ease of training young researchers to work with yeast, the rapid growth, and well-developed set of research tools, makes it an ideal research opportunity for high school students, undergraduate, and graduate students.  This award allowed 8 graduate students and 29 undergraduate students to obtain experience in experimental design, project development, and technical expertise.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elaine Sia"
