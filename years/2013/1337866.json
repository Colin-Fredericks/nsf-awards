The instrument, a modular rehabilitation device, in its simplest form consists of a computer, a camera, and adaptive software for assessment and training of cognitive functions. In its final, most complex form, the instrument will integrate data from a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic-arm with gimbals and torque sensing, a Kinect sensor, multiple cameras, an eye-tracking device, a touch screen, a microphone, and an fNIRS brain imaging sensor. \r\nThe instrument will be developed in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators develop a Barrett robot arm. In the second phase, the instrument will extend to a Kinect sensor, multiple cameras, an eye-tracking device, and related low-cost components, along with the assessment software for assessing motor function and cognitive, emotional, and personality functioning. \r\niRehab consists integrates multidisciplinary methodologies and sensors to assess and assist the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of persons affected by various impairments. This work highly interdisciplinary work follows a cyber-physical approach. It provides new research opportunities across the fields of human-centered computing, computer vision, assistive technology, robotics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. This work advances research in human brain activity mapping, personalized medicine, and big data. \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe proposed instrument exhibits potential for large broader impact as it directly contributes to future healthcare and human wellbeing improving accessibility to affordable rehabilitation for a broad range of patients. The instrument is likely to accelerate the recovery of a large spectrum of injuries and diseases including those causing motor, neurological, and cognitive disorders. An education plan includes course development, internships, workshops and tutorials, and an on-line resource center. In addition to many educational impacts, impact will be felt on the fundamental research in the areas addressed.",
