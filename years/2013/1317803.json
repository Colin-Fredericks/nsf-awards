 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virtual Robot Test and Integration Laboratory (VRTIL) addresses the need to verify robot software using real data, produced by real sensors, in all its richness and imperfection. The project is embedding robot software in a synthetic environment in order to mimic its sensor interfaces. In an advance over the state of the art, these interfaces are windows into data bases that store the actual sensor data that a robot did read when it was in a particular state.\r\nThe project goal is to reproduce the real world interface as exactly as possible using data. Two basic tools enable such ?virtualization? of a real robot in a real environment:\r\n\r\n*\tVirtualized reality provides a means to produce synthetic views from virtual viewpoints that are near to an actual viewpoint for which a real image is available;\r\n\r\n*\tHigh fidelity synthesized motion gathers large amounts of data to calibrate a model that is valid across all of state space.\r\n\r\nCombining these ideas will result in a  software test environment for robot software that has the realism of data logs and the responsiveness of a simulator.  This may fundamentally transform the development of robots by lowering the cost and time of testing and debugging.",

Efforts are underway to deploy robots as self-driving cars and in warehouses. Many applications need to be developed for robots, including even basic tasks such as perceiving and interpreting the environment. Application development is challenging in reality. It may be expensive, with delays due to robot hardware issues. It may also be impractical to exhaustively test robots in reality.

Our framework for sensor simulation consists of three components. The first is sensor modeling, which describes how a sensor interacts with the environment.

The simulator helped students make progress when real robots were difficult to work with. The second simulator is a 3D Lidar simulator for off-road environments.
