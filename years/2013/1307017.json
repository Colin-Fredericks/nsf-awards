 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: The goal of this research project is to understand in detail and to control molecular self-organization processes, utilizing a simple thin film deposition instrument, the \"hollow pen writer,\" for depositing 10 - 100 nanometer thin films of small-molecule organic semiconductors from solution. The hollow pen writer provides a surprising degree of control over the properties of organic semiconductor thin films, in some ways far surpassing the results obtainable with conventional vapor deposition. The research team utilizes this method to study the relationships between process parameters and film properties, such as crystalline grain structure and grain boundary density. These studies feature real-time analysis techniques such as optical video microscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction, which are necessary in order to follow crystallization processes on time scales from milliseconds to minutes and to monitor and distinguish molecular short-range order versus long-range order. In addition, charge carrier transport in test devices such as organic field effect transistors are studied as a function of grain structure and built-in or applied stress.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Description: Organic semiconductors are designed at the molecular level to exhibit useful properties, and they promise the realization of a new generation of electronic circuits and solar cells. This research activity addresses a key step in optimal utilization of organic electronic materials, the organization of individual molecules into crystalline form through controllable processes such as coating from a liquid solution into a thin layer. Packing of molecules into crystals as well as the structure of crystal boundaries profoundly affects the properties of thin films. The research team seeks to understand the mechanisms inherent to solution processing in order to evaluate, understand, exploit, and predict the potential of new functional materials that are being synthesized at an ever-increasing rate. The societal impact of the research is amplified by innovative teaching methods and by pursuing community outreach objectives, including: an undergraduate teaching lab to make organic solar cells, enhanced through online tools for analyzing and discussing results; lectures and demonstrations designed to engage the public in a discussion of the science and applications of energy, light, materials, and nano-materials.",

However, methods to create thin films that are optimized for electronic properties need to be developed in order to realize these societal benefits.  The outcomes of this project include significant progress in monitoring the crystallization of semiconductor thin films as they are being \"written\" using a method similar to a pen, and utilizing an \"ink\" consisting of the semiconductor dissolved in a liquid solvent. Highly crystalline thin films are sought after since they can have orders of magnitude fewer electronic traps compared to non-crystalline or poly-crystalline films with small grain sizes. The observation methods used in this project range from using visible light from a customized optical microscope as a way of monitoring the crystallization process, to separately testing the electrical properties of the finished thin films after they are incorporated into test devices, primarily Organic Thin Film Transistors (OFETs). The accompanying image shows another method to monitor the crystallizaiton process by using the Grazing-Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) technique.  By monitoring the crystallization process, we discover principles that can be applied across a range of organic semiconductor materials systems, which will speed the ongoing development of new materials with novel and improved properties.\nIt was found that the liquid solution does not necessarily transform directly into the final crystalline form when it dries, but that it instead transforms via a series of \"transient\" forms that can be liquid, liquid crystalline, or crystalline in nature.  A small-molecule organic semiconductor C8-BTBT exhibits a transformation from a liquid solution to a liquid-crystal phase, followed by two different crystalline phases.  This process can be controlled by adjusting the temperature to yield very large grain size thin films at writing speeds higher than one meter per minute.  This effect is important for electronic devices because grain boundaries serve as imperfections that block the flow of electrical current.  Thin films that have been optimized in this way exhibit both enhanced intrinsic properties where charge carriers move through the organic semiconductor material more easily, and more simply by elimination of grain boundaries to remove barriers to current flow.  The high writing speeds made possible by this method also suggests that the process is scalable to a practical high-throughput manufacturing process.\nIt was also found that transient metastable states can be stabilized by strain, i.e. by stretching or compressing the thin films. In TIPS-pentacene, another small-molecule organic semiconductor, thin films fabricated at temperatures above room temperature have a different molecular spacing than films fabricated at room temperature.  These differences translate into measureable difference in the wavelengths (colors) of light absorbed by the material and are also fundamentally linked to the electrical properties that determine how easily current can flow, and ultimately the quality of devices based on the material.  When TIPS-pentacene thin films are cooled to room temperature immediately after being fabricated at elevated temperature, it is found that they do not return to their room-temperature properties.  Instead, the films become strained because they are constrained to the substrate that they have been written on (normally silicon, glass, or a polymer material), which does not change its molecular spacing significantly over the temperature range employed to fabricate the thin films.  This effect has been used to create films with significantly enhanced carrier mobility relative to the normal room temperature state, which shows the potential usefulness of the technique.\n In addition, advances in thin film processing methods have been developed that allow stacking of multiple layers of different materials, which is an important ability for technological applications. Several research collaborators have adopted our \"pen-writer\" technique, which is an impact beyond this immediate work.  One industry collaborator has also helped to develop ultraviolet-visible light absorption techniques to monitor thin film formation and transient states in real-time measurements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall L Headrick"
