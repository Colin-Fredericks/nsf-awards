 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Dr. Coran Watanabe from Texas A&M University and Dr. Stephen Ealick of Cornell University to collaboratively  characterize enzymes of the azinomycin biosynthetic pathway both functionally and structurally.  Specifically, this project is directed at the evaluation of thioesterase-domain interacting partners and structural characterization of the iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) AziB, as well as  functional characterization of both AziA2, and the of azabicycle biosynthetic enzymes.  This project also aims at a structural understanding of the bacterial Type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the construction of the azinomycin naphthoate. While it was long thought that all bacterial aromatic polyketides are derived from Type II PKSs, it is now clear that this is not the case and the azinomycin PKS serves as a specific example. The azinomycin PKS will thus serve as a model system for this bacterial Type I iterative PKS class.  Experiments will elucidate the key role of an unusual non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) module of unprecedented domain architecture (C-PCP-C). The azinomycins also contain an aziridine ring system, the biosynthesis of which is poorly understood.  These studies should provide inroads into the route and mechanism of aziridine formation through the functional characterization of four enzymes of this pathway. \r\n\r\nNatural products or secondary metabolites are compounds that are produced by a given organism but are not essential to the survival of the host.  Such compounds often possess potent bioactivities and serve as lead compounds for the development of therapeutic agents.  The biosynthesis of the azinomycins is under investigation here.  The azinomycins are a family of DNA crosslinking agents with demonstrated anti-tumor activity.  Understanding how nature constructs these strained ring systems should shed light on a fundamental mechanistic question in biosynthesis and  also pave the way for the engineering of the pathway genes for therapeutic purposes, in the longer term.  This project also includes an outreach component where both undergraduate and high school students will be exposed to natural products research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe azinomycins are a class of anti-tumor agents produced by a soil bacterium.  The activity resides in their ability to target DNA, the genetic basis of all life.  The compound is architecturally fascinating with different portions of the molecule contributing to the biological actions of the compound.  The current investigation evaluates how portions of the molecule are biosynthesized, i.e. how nature constructs these molecules.  In the long term, such studies might enable the genetic manipulation of the pathway for the development of more selective cancer therapies.   This study reports and reveals the unusual biosynthetic formation of the 5-methyl naphthoate moiety, which is essential for effective DNA association.  It also provides the inroads to the biosynthetic construction of the azinomycin azabicycle unit.  The azabicycle is one of two positions in the molecule, which enable crosslinks to form with DNA.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOrganic Chemistry involves the study of carbon-based compounds including their structure, properties, and reactions.  The PI developed a stream of sophomore organic chemistry taught from a life sciences perspective.  The course included an experiential component where the students performed their own field collection of soil samples.  Soil contains microorganisms that harbor useful bioactive compounds that can be exploited for the development of drugs, e.g. antibiotics, anti-cancer agents.  More than 50% of all therapies come from natural products (metabolites from the environment) or inspired by a natural product.  For example, the antibiotic penicillin is derived from a fungus.  The samples were, therefore, evaluated by the PI for antibiotic activity against E. coli.  The assay and the results were shared with the class.\n\n            The PI developed a lecture and accompanying laboratory experiment to expose high school students to natural products research.  Students learned about where drugs came from, the issues with antibiotic resistance, and the importance of taking the full prescribed course of antibiotics.   They learned to carry out a zone of inhibition assay comparing the effect of ampicillin (a relative of penicillin) against E. coli and E. coli that contain a putative beta-lactamase (drug resistance gene).  See Figures 1 and 2 for pictures from some of these events.\n\n            During the course of the grant period, the azinomycin project has also enabled the research training of one postdoctoral fellow, five graduate students, and 12 undergraduate students.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Coran Watanabe"
