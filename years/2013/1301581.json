 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Carolina Dynamics Symposium will run in early April 2013; itis a two day conference that has rotated among colleges and universities in North and South Carolina for the past 10 years.  The 2013 conference will be hosted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a special emphasis in symbolic dynamics and coding theory, a branch of mathematics with many applications.   Each year a few speakers from outside the region will be invited to give plenary talks on the theme chosen for the year by the host institution, and regional speakers will also address a broad spectrum of topics in areas of dynamical systems, pure and applied.  The meetings are aimed to attract prominent mathematical scientists in the region, as well as graduate students and junior faculty from higher educational institutions in the Carolinas. \r\n\r\n\r\nA primary purpose of the Carolina Dynamics Symposium is to allow mathematicians in the broad field of dynamical systems, at all career stages and types of institutions, to come together for several days to strengthen professional relationships and interactions.  We plan to build on a successful format by enlarging participation to include several outside experts while maintaining the open invitation to participate fully to the regional mathematicians.   From its inception participants and speakers in the Carolina Dynamics meetings have included graduate students, junior and senior faculty, as well as undergraduates.  The organizers invite and advertise to a demographically diverse group, and often half the speakers are women.  The meetings are designed to strengthen and invigorate the dynamics community in the southeast.  By working together its members can achieve more than by working alone;  many fruitful collaborations have resulted from past meetings and we expect the activity to increase with this grant.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.devio.us/~ppunosevac/cdynsys/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Carolina Dynamics Symposium promotes research discussions and collaborations in the field of dynamical systems and related topics, such as ergodic theory, control theory, celestial mechanics, complex dynamics, symplectic geometry and their applications.   A conference has been held each year since 2003 in different institutions throughout the Carolinas and Georgia since 2003.   Under NSF grant DMS 1301581 the symposium became more diverse due to its ability to attract more particpants and widen the topics of study.\n\nThe NSF grant allowed the scope and participation to extend beyond the local level to include more attendees and speakers.  During the past three years, symposia have been held at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, (Chapel Hill, NC), Davidson College (Davidson, NC), and Agnes Scott College (Decatur, GA) respectively.  Attendees  and speakers ranged from undergraduates to distinguished professors, and all three conferences involved many informal research discussions as well.  The grant allowed the Carolina Dynamics conference to include more participants who are students, both undergraduates and graduates, and over half the speakers have been women.   The grant afforded the opportunity to add a speaker the afternoon before the main set of talks, who devoted a talk specifically to undergraduates in STEM fields.\n\nThe broader impact of this grant was to disseminate exciting research ideas in a vibrant area of mathematics, dynamical systems, to a wide and diverse audience at universities and colleges in the southeastern United States.    Two of the symposia have taken place at all women undergraduate institutions (Meredith College and Agnes Scott), and many participants and speakers have been women faculty and undergraduates.  With the added talk and informal discussion before the formal talks begin, made possible by the grant, many more undergraduates participate each year.\n\nThe intellectual merit of  these symposia results from the research topics presented.  Talks in these conferences have covered applications of dynamical systems from HIV and Ebola to neural complexity  and production of semiconductors.   In addition, cutting edge mathematical topics have been discussed both formally in talks and informally between talks, resulting in several publications following from these discussions each year.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane M Hawkins"
