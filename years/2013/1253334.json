 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is an injection of new modeling techniques into the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The approach is to design new architectures for domain-specific modeling tools in order to permit feedback from analysis, validation, and verification engines to influence how CPSs are designed. This project involves new research into the integration of existing, heterogeneous modeling languages in order to address problems in CPS design, rather than a single language for all CPS. Since many tools for analysis, validation, and verification focus on at most two of the three major components of CPS (communication, computation, and control), new paradigms in modeling are used to integrate tools early in the design process. The algorithms and software developed in this project run validation and verification tools on models, and then close the loop by using the tool outputs to automatically modify the system models.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of design requirements in CPSs is critical for tomorrow's societal technologies such as smart buildings, home healthcare, and water management. Among the most compelling design requirements are those of safety, and CPSs for autonomous vehicles exemplify this well. By involving a full-sized autonomous vehicle in this project, the validation and verification of safety requirements is tied to a concrete platform that is broadly understood. By involving students in the design of behaviors of the vehicle, the project exposes scientists and engineers of tomorrow to societal-scale problems, and tools to address them.",

Their intricate nature requires new modeling techniques for capturing the interaction between the system components, as well as with the physical environment. The objective of this project is to design new architectures for domain-specific modeling tools that permit feedback from analysis, validation, and verification engines. This is achieved via the integration of existing, heterogeneous modeling languages into a single framework. Since many tools for analysis, validation, and verification focus on at most two of the three major components of CPSs (communication, computation, and control), new paradigms in modeling are used to incorporate tools early in the design process. The algorithms and software developed in this project run validation and verification tools on models and then close the loop by using the outputs to automatically modify those models.</p>\n<p><br />The project resulted in the following major outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />A Dynamic Constraint Feedback Metamodeling Language (DCFML) framework for CPS applications. This language provides the required high-level abstractions for the domain-expert CPS designer, where lower-level implementations are based on well-known practices. The key novelty of the DCFML framework relative to existing domain-specific modeling environments is the incorporation of dynamic constraints as part of the modeling process. This promotes a correct-by-construction approach, where the loop is closed after the initial design via Dynamic Constraint Feedback (DCF) to ensure that the model does not violate any constraints. The DCFML paradigm was validated in two CPS case studies. In the first study, a prior domain-specific modeling language was adapted to the new construct of the DCFML. The second case study involved the development of a new language under the DCFML, with a focus on full automatic model correction and off-the-shelf verification tools. The latter case study led to the enrichment of the DCFML framework with automatic model verification through model transformation.</p>\n<p><br />Moreover, as part of this project, several breakthroughs were achieved with respect to control algorithms for autonomous vehicles, a prime example of CPSs. Specifically, an unsupervised offline data processing technique to track the positions of multiple vehicles on a circular track was developed. Compared to the previous data collection techniques, our method is significantly more accurate and efficient, relying only on a 360-degree panoramic camera.&nbsp; Furthermore, eight experimental datasets that contain accurate and high-resolution vehicle trajectories and instantaneous fuel rates were collected, under controlled conditions. It is important to note that accurate datasets for complex real-highway situations already exist, but certain research tasks (e.g., developing car-following models) can benefit from datasets that remove much of the noise associated with highway traffic and contain the occurrence of traffic waves caused by car-following dynamics.&nbsp; Using the collected data, new stochastic error models capable of reproducing measurement errors of distance measurements based on real-world LiDAR traces were developed. Finally, novel control strategies to dampen stop-and-go waves created by human drivers were developed. The strategies were verified with field experiments.</p>\n<p><br />In terms of broader impacts, a CAT vehicle testbed simulator was released under an open-source license. The simulator emulates the CAT Vehicle testbed, which is a full-sized Ford Escape controlled via ROS messaging. It was integrated into the curricula of several courses and was used by over 100 undergraduate students. Moreover, a simple educational modeling language was developed. The Pathing Language is a simple design-specific modeling language intended for elementary school students to design behaviors for a self-driving vehicle. The simplicity of the language serves as an example design domain that demonstrates fitting a language into the verification feedback framework. 4th-grade elementary students were able to build paths for the self-driving CAT vehicle that satisfied safety constraints and see the vehicle move into a football field according to their models. The project also supported several graduate and undergraduate students and also provided research opportunities to undergraduate students attending the CAT vehicle REU program. It resulted in numerous publications with student co-authors that were broadly disseminated to the research community. Finally, it generated a plethora of multi-media content for both researchers and the general public to promote the project outcomes.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045157237_catV--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045157237_catV--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CAT Vehicle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045157237_catV--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CAT Vehicle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CAT Vehicle with GPS/IMU  and Laser Rangefinder mounted on it.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Sprinkle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CAT Vehicle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932942450_ScreenShot2021-08-25at4.03.07PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932942450_ScreenShot2021-08-25at4.03.07PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Canyon View Elementary Cat Vehicle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932942450_ScreenShot2021-08-25at4.03.07PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon View Elementary Cat Vehicle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students of the Canyon View Elementary check out the Cat Vehicle</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Sprinkle</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Canyon View Elementary Cat Vehicle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932861210_canyonview_0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932861210_canyonview_0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Canyon View Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1629932861210_canyonview_0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon View Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Model of the Canyon View Elementary grounds created by the Cat Vehicle</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Sprinkle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Canyon View Model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045219876_catvSim--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045219876_catvSim--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cat Vehicle Simulation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045219876_catvSim--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cat Vehicle Simulation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The model of the CAT Vehicle used in the simulator</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Sprinkle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cat Vehicle Simulation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045289332_ModelingEnv--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045289332_ModelingEnv--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Path Modeling Environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1253334/1253334_10234111_1630045289332_ModelingEnv--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Path Modeling Environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The modeling interface that 4th graders used to operate an autonomous vehicle in non-expert fashion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Sprinkle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Path Modeling Environment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
