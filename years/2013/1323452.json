Annually, Fellows are selected competitively and placed in offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the Fellow and the host directorate or office. By providing insight into the decision-making process, and learning about current issues affecting the scientific and engineering enterprise, Fellows will discover how NSF funds science, while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues relating to NSF's mission support of basic science and engineering research and education. \r\n\r\nFellows will work with staff involved in planning, development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of fundamental research. Assignments may involve significant interagency, congressional or international activity, as well as involvement with the National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an orientation on executive branch and congressional operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on matters involving science, technology and public policy.",
