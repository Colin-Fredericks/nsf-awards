 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. One of the fundamental patterns of ocean biogeochemistry is the Redfield ratio, linking the stoichiometry of surface plankton with the chemistry of the deep ocean. There is no obvious mechanism for the globally consistent C:N:P ratio of 106:16:1 (Redfield ratio), especially as there is substantial elemental variation among plankton communities in different ocean regions.  Thus, knowing how biodiversity regulates the elemental composition of the ocean is important for understanding the ocean and climate as a whole -- now and in the future. \r\n\r\nThe conceptual hypotheses for this study are as follows:\r\n1.  The C:N:P ratio of a cell is constrained by its broad taxonomic group, which determines, for example, whether it has an outer shell, its size, functional metabolism, membrane lipid composition.\r\n2.  Within a taxon, there is high genetic diversity.  Some of this genetic diversity is potentially laterally transferred, or can be lost within taxa, and confers various functional abilities (organic phosphate assimilation, nitrate assimilation, photoheterotrophy, etc.).  Functional diversity provides the cell with further flexibility, such as the ability to respond to varying nutrient supply rates/ratios, and affects a cell's C:N:P ratio within the range specified by the taxon.\r\n3.  Given these taxonomic and genetic constraints, a cell is physiologically plastic and modifies how it allocates cellular resources in response to nutrient supply rates/ratios in the environment.\r\n4.  The microbial diversity (taxonomic, genetic, and functional) of the surface ocean varies over time and space, driven by many factors in addition to nutrients.  The sum of this mixture composes the ecosystem C:N:P, the ratio that Redfield described.  \r\n\r\nBased on this framework, the CoPIs will make field observations of taxon-specific stoichiometry and growth rates, genomic analyses, and conduct laboratory chemostat experiments to improve understanding of how ocean taxonomic, genetic, and functional biodiversity control the stoichiometry of the surface ocean plankton.  Their analyses of these data would lead to a mechanistic understanding of variations in the Redfield ratio, both spatially and temporally.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts.  This study will greatly expand knowledge of the genomic diversity among ocean microbes and how this diversity affects biogeochemistry.  The stoichiometry of the ocean's microbes is a parameter that nearly every chemical or biological oceanographer uses, from converting measurements made in one element to another, to estimating regional and global nitrogen budgets.  The research also has important implications for the global carbon budget and any changes that might result from climate change.  Beyond training three postdoctoral scholars and two graduate students, a Gateway Mentoring Program will be established to recruit undergraduates (total of 12) transferring from community colleges in the Southern California area, training and preparing them for careers in research-oriented science. The program will consist of extensive mentoring, research experiences at UCI, internships at BIOS, Princeton, or UCSD, and presentations at national conferences.  This intensive mentoring and research experience prepares students well for a career in science, and enhances acceptance to post-graduate schools.  The Program will have a very high proportion of underrepresented groups as reflected in the targeted colleges.\r\n\r\nIntegration.  To understand mechanistically temporal and spatial variability of the plankton C:N:P ratio, biodiversity must be studied not only at the traditional taxonomic level, but at the genetic and functional levels which dictate organism response to their environment.  Data will be integrated into a combined ocean ecological, evolutionary, and biogeochemical model, with flexible stoichiometry, including cellular biochemical allocations.  Seeding a coupled physical-biological model of the oceans with multiple competing genotypes enables the exploration of ecological and evolutionary patterns of resource acquisition and C:N:P ratios.  Developing a more mechanistic examination of the course of ecology and evolution, in which laboratory and field data define tradeoffs between different growth and nutrient acquisition strategies, would estabblish the framework of adaptive dynamics for determining \"evolutionarily convergence\".  Finally, model outcomes will be evaluated against field data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe global ocean absorbs roughly 25% of global carbon dioxide emissions through the processes of photosynthesis, termed primary production, and sinking of newly formed particulate organic material, termed carbon export.  This combination of processes is complex and is not well enough understood as too allow confident predictions of the future abilities of ocean biology to continue absorbing carbon dioxide release.  There are many reasons for this uncertainty in our understanding ranging from limitations in experimental and observational methodologies, to undersampling in space and time, to variability in the physiology and behavior of plankton that is not currently measured or understood in the ocean.  This project focused on the latter, understanding the variability in phytoplankton physiology to changes in environment over a wide range of oceanic environments.  Specifically, we studied how the elemental ratios of the key nutrients carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus changed between different phytoplankton and in response to changes in environment within the same phytoplankton group. \n\nThe particulate elemental ratio of carbon to nitrogen to phosphorus is termed the Redfield Ratio and is a central oceanographic tenant that directly bears on the ability of ocean biology to take up carbon dioxide.  We studied the ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in three primary phytoplankton groups, the photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria) Prochlorococcus and Synechoccocus, and the small flagellated true (eukaryotic) phytoplankton.  Collectively these three groups comprise the majority of the phytoplankton biomass over roughly 60% of the global ocean surface area. \n\nWe observed that on average, the cyanobacteria had significantly greater carbon, nitrogen to phosphorus ratios than the eukaryotic phytoplankton.  This pattern held across a wide range of environmental nutrient conditions.  When the data were examined more deeply, it is clear that there are regions where both cyanobacteria and phytoplankton have cellular elemental ratios that match the Redfield Ratio, but this is uncommon.  The cyanobacteria showed a particularly strong ability to change their physiological condition such that they would reach a minimum cellular nitrogen and carbon content, but their cellular phosphorus content would still decrease by an order of magnitude.  While eukaryotic phytoplankton sometimes were observed to show a similar pattern, their overall ability, their cellular plasticity, was much less than that of the cyanobacteria.\n\nThe implications of this work are that the cyanobacteria, which are of major importance over much of the ocean\u00c6s surface area, more efficient at fixing carbon per unit phosphorus than eukaryotes and thus,  as those organisms are grazed upon or sink in the open ocean they remove relatively more carbon than other phytoplankton.  Thus in a future ocean, if these cyanobacteria were to expand their geographical extent or increase their cell abundance, the ocean\u00c6s biological sequestration of carbon would continue and perhaps may even increase.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael W Lomas"
