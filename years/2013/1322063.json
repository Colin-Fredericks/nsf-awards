 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96,? general purpose regional vessel operated by the University of Miami?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  \r\n\r\nThe R/V WALTON SMITH conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf economy.  In 2012, R/V Walton Smith completed 143 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 25% of the total sailing schedule. In 2013, R/V Walton Smith is scheduled for 108 days with NSF days accounting for 17% of the total sailing schedule.\r\n\r\nOceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n \r\n1)\t1m MOCNESS Overhaul and Spares\t$15,890\t\r\n2)\tPOSMV Upgrade\t$97,089\t\r\n3)\tNisken Water Sampler\t$10,000\t\r\n4)\tAltimeter of use with CTD Systems\t$3,910\t\r\n5)\tIntegrated Optical Bow Sensor Suite\t$21,751\t\r\nTOTAL\t$148,640\t\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
