 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on context-aware security and privacy for RFID systems and has yielded a number of security and privacy techniques for RFID systems. These techniques include: \r\n1)\tContext-aware selective unlocking techniques to prevent malicious reading of sensitive information stored on RFID tags; \r\n2)\tContext-aware transaction verification to secure authentication in NFC-based mobile payment system\r\n3)\tContext-aware malware protection to prevent malicious use of NFC chips and other valuable resources on smartphones. \r\nThe research team has built prototypes on a wireless identification and sensing platform as well as a smartphone. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of these techniques which are ready for further development.  The objective of this I-Corps project is to further develop contextaware security and privacy techniques developed by the research team. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this project is derived from security mechanisms utilizing various contextual information to provide enhanced security and privacy for RFID systems. This technology is user-friendly, involving minimal user interruption. It applies to a wide range of RFID applications including e-identity cards (e-passport, e-driver license), payment cards (credit card), electronic toll collection systems, access cards, and medical implants. It has the potential, for both corporations and individuals, to drastically reduce financial loss from identity theft due to a compromised e-identity card (passport, driver license) or payment card. In addition the technology has been developed with ease of use in mind, and thus will be more attractive to end users.",

To achieve the objective, the team has conducted a market discovery for secure mobile payment system by interviewing with about 140+ potential customers, device manufacturers, credit companies, banks, credit card payment procesors. During the market discovery, we constantly use the feedback to change value proposition. Our original product is \"Fraud buster - context-aware security and privacy techniques for RFID/NFC mobile payment\". However, after we have done an extensive interview with 140+ entities, we decided to change our value proposition to \"Smartphone sentinel - providing confidence that your privacy is protected\". There are several reasons for us to make such a change. First, although NFC is a hot topic in mobile payment market, the dominating mobile payment system in the US such as Square is not NFC-based. NFC-based Google Wallet is still not popular. Second, it might because of the first reason, chip manufactures, bankers, and credit card companies show not much interest in investing in security products due to mobile payment fraud. Also, financial institutions such as banks and credit companies have taken risk of fraud in their budget model. So as long as loss due to fraud is under a certain threshold, they are not very motivated in investing in techniques. On the other hand, customers we have interviewed showed great interest in products that can help to protect their privacy due to the use of smartphones. Under Smartphone Sentinel, we developed two prototype systems. The first one monitors the usage of sensitive resources on the phone and warns users the access of such resources. The second one deduces user access intention through transparent and easy gestures to curb user-unaware malware access. The systems have been domonstrated at the college's Showcase in 2014.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/15/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Di&nbsp;Ma</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
