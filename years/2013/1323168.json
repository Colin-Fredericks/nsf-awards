 "awd_abstract_narration": "This initiative is a collaboration of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the EcoTarium science museum in Worcester, MA, other scientists and teachers at Clark University in Massachusetts and at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, along with six other museums in New England and California.  The project seeks to develop and study a model that would integrate the science research on urban systems into science museum exhibits and programs, starting in this phase in a new \"City Science\" exhibit space at the EcoTarium.  The goal is to learn how to assist citizens in decision-making and shaping a sustainable future for their communities.  \r\n \r\nThe work builds on the NSF/SBS-funded Urban Long-term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) network, one of a set of awards by NSF/SBS and NSF/BIO in the area of urban ecology.  The exhibit (with four sections: neighborhood design; land use and land cover; urban biodiversity; urban heat island effect) will include activities related to \"alternative futures\" of cities, will be designed to be updated as new results from this research are produced and also to allow for visitors to respond to survey questions about their city environment that will be used by the researchers.\r\n \r\nDeliverables will also include an integration of the prototype exhibits with an NSF-funded K-12 urban ecology curriculum (co-PI from Loyola Marymount University), which has already been done with nature centers and would now expand into science museums. \r\n \r\nThe significance of this work includes the growing importance of new research on human/ecology interaction in cities coupled with applications of this research to Public Participation in Science Research (PPSR) and local decisions and choices.  It is driven by the future vision of the cities in which the target audience(s) is located.  The work in Worcester will focus on reaching underserved audiences, which characterizes much of the city of Worcester, and will include partnerships with local schools and community groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed a model for integrating the science of urban systems into exhibits in urban science museums through a three-way partnership between the EcoTarium, an innovative science museum in Worcester, MA with two-existing NSF-funded networks.  These networks engage urban ecology researchers from the natural and social sciences as well as science curriculum developers and teachers.  The study of urban systems is at the forefront of scientific inquiry to address the complex interconnections of human and natural systems, but findings are only now beginning to emerge and have not been disseminated to the general public.  This project used the City Science exhibits at the EcoTarium as a beta-test site for a reseach-exhibit focused on urban ecosystems. \n\nThis project achieved the goals of 1) increasing informal learning about science by integrating NSF-funded urban ecological research with exhibit prototype interactives with data flowing both from the research to the exhibit and from the exhibit back to the research (via public participation in scientific research), 2) integrating an NSF-funded K-12 urban ecology curriculum with the exhibit interactives to inform both the interactives and new curriculum modules, and 3) planning for national expansion of the model by bringing together staff from six other science museums in California and New England to review the exhibit prototypes. This PATHWAYS grant served as the catalyst for building a collaborative structure that links existing projects in order to develop and pilot innovative informal learning exhibits about urban ecology. \n\nIn particular, the project allowed visitors to contribute their ideas about urban planning and design through a Neighborhood Design Area exhibit entitled Magnetic Neighborhood.  In addition, the project developed four other interactive exhibits related to urban systems: Urban Biodiversity Area (Best Nest) and What Comes Out at Night?; Land Use/ Land Cover (Turtle?s Eye View); and Urban Heat Island (City Hot Zones).  These prototype exhibits were tested on the museum floor with a diverse range of museum visitors during the project period.  Over 400 visitors of all ages, directly participated in the exhibit development by testing out the exhibits and giving feedback.  The exhibits developed from initial rough prototypes to final hardened prototypes that are being fabricated for the final exhibit which will open in January, 2017.\n\nThis study tested an innovative \"research-exhibit feedback loop\" by exploring how exposure to the interactive urban ecology exhibits influenced visitors? design of an \"ideal neighborhood\" as part of the Magnetic Neighborhood exhibit.  A three-day pilot study on the museum floor involved interviews with 80 visitors of all ages about their choices in creating a neighborhood with magnet pieces.  Results of this initial study indicated a possible correlation between exposure to ecological exhibits and visitors? urban planning decisions.  \n\nDue to the labor-intensive aspects of this data collection, the project team conducted a follow-up study with 180 visitors that sought to automate the process of tracking and analyzing visitors? \"ideal neighborhoods\" using a station that computer scanned visitors? neighborhood trays. This new station created a more efficient method for capturing the images of visitors? neighborhoods and asking them questions about their decisions.  Both studies found that visitors regardless of age included green spaces such as trees and parks in their ideal neighborhood more than any other feature.\n\nAnother part of this project involved showing visitors images with a variety of housing densities and types of urban greening and asking them to indicate their preferences for inclusion in an \"ideal neighborhood.\"  The study allows museum visitors to engage in social science research and discuss the type of neighborhoods they prefer, providing an additional perspective to the Magnetic Neighborhood exhibit.  In order to reach a more diverse population, this study was conducted with a total of 138 people on the museum floor as well as at two public gatherings in the City of Worcester.  Preliminary study results point to the role of urban street trees in increasing participants? preference for different housing densities.\n\nThe data collected in this project contributes to the ongoing urban ecological research on people?s perceptions of alternate urban designs.  The results of this project have been written up in a journal article, conference proceedings, research report, two master?s theses, and a PhD dissertation (in process). The City Science exhibit engages urban residents in the social science research process, an area that has received less attention in many science museums, as well as engages them in hand?s on exhibits related to urban ecology, urban heat island, and land use change.  Approximately 150,000 visitors a year will be exposed to urban ecology research when the exhibit opens in January 2017.   Furthermore, the study provides a model for other science museums including the six museums in New England and California who gave feedback on the exhibit.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Ryan"
