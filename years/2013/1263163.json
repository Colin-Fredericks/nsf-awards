 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Computational and Integrative Biology (CCIB) at Rutgers University - Camden, will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015 under a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award. The program focuses on an interdisciplinary approach to research in computational biology and will include integrating experimental biology and computational modeling in fields such as ecology, animal group movement, plant physiology and synthetic engineering of biofuels. The CCIB has faculty from five departments who will serve as mentors and graduate students who will act as near-peer mentors.  Participating students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and workshops, such as publishing, insights on global issues and societal needs, regulatory issues, licensing, and entrepreneurship. The project will introduce students to research in computational biology; encourage students to pursue a major in STEM disciplines and/or a career in scientific research; develop tangible academic, professional, and personal skills; foster a collaborative environment that encourages discovery and innovation; expose students to areas of relevance related to scientific R&D such as ethics and responsible conduct of research, technology transfer; and finally, equip participants to make well informed decisions on their academic and professional career. The REU Site will recruit students that would not otherwise have any access to a research experience. Moreover, the students targeted are expected to be at a critical stage where they are deciding whether to change academic focus, follow a new career path, and/or re-engage in academic study.  Students will be recruited in collaboration with a number of New Jersey community colleges and the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), the nation?s first tri-service military installation.  Students are tracked to determine their continued academic interests, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program encourages students to stay connected to their REU experience by participating as \"alumni\" of the program during orientation of subsequent years. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://ccib.camden.rutgers.edu/reu.html , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Benedetto Piccoli at piccoli@camden.rutgers.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Overview.\nThe project provided a unique integrated research experience to 10 undergraduate students each summer from 2013 to 2015. Participants were involved in projects focused on computational biology at Rutgers-Camden. In particular the students were hosted in dry and wet labs within the framework of the Center for Computational and Integrative Biology (CCIB). \nResearch experience.\nThe 10-week summer program included a first three weeks of training. In particular three mini courses were offered to students: 1) Mathematical methods for system biology; 2) Computational modeling of biological systems; 3) Experimental design and hypothesis testing. A number of enrichment sections were offered, including: lab safety, library training, women in science, intellectual property and commercialization, civic engagement, planning a scientific career and writing for scientific journals. Participants performed research in five labs (two students per lab), met weekly with all other participants and biweekly with faculty, presenting their projects and advancement. They also interacted with graduate students (both PhD and Master) of their research groups. The program ended with a written report for each student and a poster presentation for each project to CCIB faculty. The best posters were presented at national conferences on undergraduate research. Moreover, participants\u00c6 research gave rise to three publications (two already published and one submitted) and working papers.\nIntellectual merit\nThe results of the research projects contributed to the scientific knowledge in the specific research fields of the faculty acting as project leaders. More specifically:\nProject 1. Explored the fungi development and biofuel production using fungi.\nProject 2. Validated mathematical models for birds groups via analysis of pictures and videos.\nProject 3. Tested genes in regulatory network of E. coli (most common bacterium).\nProject 4. Increased knowledge on cell morphogenesis and development in higher plants.\nProject 5. Explored the effects of benzodiazepines and steroids on neuron receptors.\nBroader impacts\n The participating students increased their skills and knowledge in lab and field research activities, enthusiasm for and interest in scientific research, writing and presenting research results and collaborative teamwork. They also developed specific knowledge on mathematical and computational modeling of biological systems and on wet lab techniques. All students increased their interest in STEM fields, scientific research and are currently enrolled in graduate studies or planning to. Moreover, the project had wide media coverage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benedetto Piccoli"
