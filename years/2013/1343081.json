This is a long-standing series of conferences that are held each fall at Pennsylvania State University-University Park. The theme of the Penn State dynamics workshop varies from year to year; the  focus  areas include smooth ergodic theory, rigidity theory, smooth  group actions, and classical mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe format of the conference provides ample opportunities for young mathematicians to present their work and otherwise to participate fully in conference activities. The bulk of the support goes to  graduate students, postdocs,  young faculty and women.  A specific feature of the conference in the odd years is the announcement of the winner of the  bi-yearly Michael Brin Prize in Dynamical Systems, endowed  by the father of one the founders of Google, Professor Emeritus of the University of Maryland Michael Brin,  and a special session featuring talks on the winner's work  by the leading international experts in the area.",
