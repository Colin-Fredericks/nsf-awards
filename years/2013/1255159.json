 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines how changes in agriculture affect streams and lakes, using a landscape in southwestern Ohio as a model system. Observed changes in agricultural practices include a pronounced increase in conservation tillage, reduced fertilizer use, and fewer farm animals (especially hogs). These changes are reducing the amounts of soil sediment and chemicals that run off from farms into streams. This project will quantify these changes along with the subsequent responses of a downstream lake. The amount of algae in the lake has been increasing, because the lower sediment in the water has allowed more sunlight to penetrate. However, it is predicted that algae in the lake will decrease over time as the nutrient supply continues to decline. Another prediction is that the common sediment-eating gizzard shad will decline because of lower sediment inputs. These fish recycle large quantities of nutrients from the sediments to the algae. Therefore, if the fish decline, algae should decline even more rapidly. \r\n\r\nChanges in agricultural practices that are occurring in Ohio are also occurring throughout the United States, yet there is a lack of information on the long-term responses of lakes and streams. Because agriculture is a major source of non-point sediment and nutrient pollution to streams and lakes, this project will provide critical information for decision makers involved in water quality protection, sustainable agriculture, and fisheries management. In addition the project will provide numerous educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be actively engaged in all aspects of the research. Finally, a planned watershed education center, when completed, will showcase this research and help educate the general public on the extent to which activities on land affect water quality.",

This long-term research (~25 years) examines how changes in agriculture affect streams and lakes, using a landscape in southwestern Ohio, the Acton Lake watershed, as a model system. The most important agricultural change is a large increase in conservation tillage, which occurred mostly from 1990-2000. During this time, the number of farms using conservation tillage increased by about 4-fold, and held steady since this time. In conservation tillage, which includes no-till, farmers plow their fields much less, sometimes not at all in a given year. This method reduces soil erosion, which benefits the farmer, but also reduces the amount of soil that reaches streams draining these fields. Indeed, during the first half (10-12 years) of our study this shift to conservation tillage reduced the amounts of sediments (soil) and nutrients in &lsquo;runoff&rsquo; that flowed from farms to streams in our study watershed. However, stream water quality shifted over the second half of our study (the most recent 10-12 years). Concentrations of sediments and nitrogen in streams continued to decline during this period, but concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (the form most available to algae) increased. Our research measures the changes in sediments and nutrients in streams, and how this affects water quality in a lake downstream. Acton Lake.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amount of algae in Acton Lake increased over the first half of our study, because the decrease is sediments in lake water caused an increase in the amount of sunlight available to algae, which allowed them to grow more. In addition, over this same period the number of an important fish, the gizzard shad, increased in the lake. These fish consume mud off the lake bottom and release nutrients in their waste products; these nutrients are then taken up by algae. Thus, these fish are basically &lsquo;nutrient pumps,&rsquo; moving nitrogen and phosphorus from the lake bottom to algae in the water. Thus, the increase in algae during the first half of our study was likely to more light (because of less sediment in the water) and more nutrients from fish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, since about 2005 the amount of algae in the lake has not changed appreciably, and has actually declined somewhat over the past 4-5 years.

In addition, the project provides numerous educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who are actively engaged in all aspects of the research. During the past five years (the period of time supported by this award), our project has provided research and training opportunities for about 15 undergraduate students and 10 graduate students. Seven of the undegraduates are members of groups underrepresented in biology, i.e., Hispanic and/or African American. Many of the undergraduates trained on our project have gone on to graduate school or professional school, and several graduate students we have trained are now gainfully employed as professors and environmental professionals.
