 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) and San Jose State University has been awarded funding to conduct a feasibility study for an academic village that will improve the capacity for researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, STEM education, and resource managers in marine science.  MLML serves as the graduate program in Marine Science for a consortium of seven California State Universities in central California. MLML does not have available resources for visiting researchers/students or meeting/lab space for non-MLML researchers.  The collegial and academic mission of MLML suffers from this ability to provide a dynamic location where collaboration, discussion, and interaction can occur. To seek information on the needed resources from the community of potential stakeholders (central California Universities and marine institutions, resource managers, precollege educational institutions) we will develop a task force, conduct interviews with stakeholders, and develop a list of infrastructural needs to accomplish our goal. The primary goal is a clear vision of the resources needed to provide access to visiting researchers and all levels of students within and beyond the MLML consortium. This conceptual blueprint for the academic village will inform decisions on space and institutional resources as a basis for architectural and program plans.  The plans will culminate in construction of laboratories, classrooms, activity centers, and conference rooms after fund raising. For more information about MLML please see our website: http://www.mlml.calstate.edu/.",
