 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to apply magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling tools to the study of interacting close binary systems such as cataclysmic variables (CVs), with the complementary goal of improving the understanding of magneto-rotational instability in accretion disks.  While observations of CVs have provided a wealth of constraints on physical models of accretion, advanced MHD models have yet to be applied to the study of the disks in these systems.  \r\n\r\nThe project will compare results from the numerical simulations of the disks around close binary star systems to observational data in order to further constrain disk parameters such as physical disk size, angular momentum transport, and global disk features (i.e. spiral shocks, hot spots, etc.).   The project will also contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students.  The project will communicate results to the public through the development of animations and visualizations of the close binary disk models made available via the web.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past 50 years, observations of accretion disks in close\nbinary systems, where two stars orbit each other so closely that\none is transferring mass to the other, have placed the most precise,\nand the most number, of observational constraints on the physics\nof accretion. At the same time, developments in theory have removed\nthe greatest uncertainty in interpreting the observations, namely\nthe origin of the angular momentum transport mechanism: it is now\nunderstood to be magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.  Over the\ncourse of this project, fully three-dimensional MHD simulations\nwere used to understand the physics of accretion in these systems.\nOur most important result was the demonstration that spiral density\nwaves, excited by the tidal forces of the binary stars, can play a\nsignificant role in the dynamics of these systems.  In fact, when\nthe disk is hot (as in the outburst phase of so-called dwarf novae\nsystems), the angular momentum transport by spiral density waves\ncan actually dominate over that by MHD turbulence, a result completely\nunexpected in modern theory.  A comprehensive series of simulations was used to investigate the global structure, time-dependent evolution, and turbulent dynamics of disks in these systems.  The attached image shows the results from one of our numerical models.  The results of this study are important for interpreting astronomical observations of a variety of systems (especially dwarf novae and cataclysmic variable stars), as well as to understand the basic plasma physics of accretion flows.  Numerical algorithms developed as part of the project also being used widely by other groups for other projects.\n\nFunding from the project supported one graduate student for her PhD\nthesis research, and involved collaboration with postdoctoral\nresearch scholars at Princeton University.  In addition to furthering\nour basic understanding of the astrophysics of disks in close\nbinaries, the project engaged students in the the use of modern\nhigh-performance computing systems, and in the development of new\nnumerical algorithms and models that have been made publically\navailable and are widely used by other research groups.  Results\nfrom the project were disseminated through a series of three published\npapers in the refereed literature, an additional three published papers in conference proceedings, including an invited review presentationa, and through over 10 research talksand seminars at institutions around the world.  In addition, the project invovled outreach and science education activities for the general public through images, animations, and resources on the web that\nexplain the science and our results.  The project led to training\nof under-represented minorities in advanced STEM areas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Stone"
