 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the factors leading to highly variable and spatially synchronized seed production, a phenomenon known as masting. Researchers are testing the novel idea that small, local differences in climate synchronize the timing of reproduction among trees, which in turn influences in the amount of pollen available each year. When trees in an area reproduce in synchrony, pollen production will be high and masting occurs. Long-term data on acorn production across California will be combined with detailed information on the timing of individual reproduction, microclimate, pollen abundance, and the fate of female flowers to test this hypothesis. Once the roles of reproductive synchrony and microclimate have been identified, the researcher will investigate the ecological consequences of masting in California oaks and the effects of climate change on this important behavior. \r\n\r\nThe project will collect statewide data on acorn production, a highly variable food resource important to both game and non-game wildlife, as well as to the communities dependent on wildlife, including ticks and tick-borne disease vectors. It targets a tree species, the valley oak, of considerable conservation interest because of development, habitat conversion, apparent lack of regeneration, and susceptibility to future climate change. Citizen scientists are engaged in the project, and an annual newsletter is used to publicize results the project broadly.",

Such species, which include oaks, many conifers, and a wide variety of taxa in temperate and boreal regions of the globe, have been of interest to evolutionary biologists for over 100 years.</p>\n<p>This award supported our work investigating this phenomenon. We started surveying acorn production by trees at our primary study site at Hastings Reservation, a field station run by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley located in central coastal California. We currently survey over 1000 trees each year, spread among eight species of oaks (genus <em>Quercus</em>) and the acorn-producing tanbark oak (<em>Lithocarpus densiflorus</em>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some aspects of masting behavior are obvious, while others are not. Chief among the former is that seed production varies a lot from year to year. Consider valley oaks (<em>Quercus lobata</em>), a widespread California species common throughout foothill regions ringing the Central Valley. Overall, acorn production clearly varies considerably from year to year (Figure 1a). The distribution of annual acorn productivity is not, however, bimodal. Plotting the frequency of years by their overall productivity, acorn production is most often intermediate in size, while years in which crops are very good or very poor are less common (Figure 1b). Masting is <em>not</em> an all or none phenomenon.</p>\n<p>An even more intriguing problem stems is masting synchrony. Masting is a population-level phenomenon by which most or all individuals in the population produce seeds synchronously from year to year. But how large is the population? And how do the trees synchronize their reproductive efforts?</p>\n<p>Again considering valley oak, we visit 11 sites throughout California, from Shasta County in the north to Los Angeles County in the south. If we correlate the mean acorn crop of trees at each pair of sites and plot the correlation coefficients against the distance between sites, we get Figure 2. The correlation between the mean acorn crops decreases with distance between sites, but is greater than zero in most cases, even between sites 600&ndash;800 kms apart. That is, the &ldquo;population&rdquo; that exhibits synchrony encompasses almost the entire geographic range of the species.</p>\n<p>The exceptions&mdash;the red dots below zero in Figure 2&mdash;are the valley oaks in the Santa Monica Mountains, the southernmost extent of the range of valley oaks. Here acorn production is negatively correlated with many of the other sites, all of which are north of the Transverse Ranges in southern California. Part of this is likely to be genetic: prior research has detected a genetic split between valley oaks north and south of the Transverse Ranges, as well as between many other California plant and animal taxa.</p>\n<p>How do the trees accomplish this synchronization? And what drives variability in seed production to begin with?</p>\n<p>Two factors appear to be most prominent in determining the investment that trees put into reproduction. These are weather conditions and how much the tree has previously invested in reproduction. Evidence supporting these assertions is illustrated in Figure 3 for valley oak. The top graph shows that when the year&rsquo;s acorn crop is poor, the <em>next</em> year&rsquo;s crop tends to be good, and vice-versa. This suggests that trees invest a lot of resources into producing acorns, and when the crop is good, they do not have much in the way of resources to invest the next year.</p>\n<p>The second factor is weather. Exactly what weather conditions favor seed production varies between species and even among sites. For valley oak at Hastings Reserve, the variable that appears to be most important is temperature during April, at the end of the period when trees are flowering. The bottom graph illustrates this relationship: warmer springs tend to be followed by larger acorn crops in the autumn.</p>\n<p>Exactly how warmer temperatures during April affect the trees so as to result in them investing in acorn production is unclear. One hypothesis is that when conditions are warmer, trees flower more synchronously, have greater access to pollen from other trees, have a larger proportion of their own flowers pollinated, and are consequently able to mature more acorns. This &ldquo;phenological synchrony&rdquo; hypothesis depends on trees being pollen limited, by no means a certainty. Multiple lines of evidence, however, support the hypothesis that pollen <em>is</em> limited, and that larger acorn crops are associated with trees (and years) when more pollen is available to them.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of problems we have addressed during the period of this award. What are the mechanisms driving masting behavior? How does masting behavior affect the communities in which it occurs? And how will climate change affect masting in the future? The wonders and mysteries of masting are many and well worth pondering on your next hike through an oak woodland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Walter&nbsp;D&nbsp;Koenig</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1256394/1256394_10228143_1632863528051_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1256394/1256394_10228143_1632863528051_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1256394/1256394_10228143_1632863528051_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) The mean acorn crop of valley oak at Hastings Reservation (mean log-transformed number of acorns counted per 30 s visual survey), 1980 ? 2021.
