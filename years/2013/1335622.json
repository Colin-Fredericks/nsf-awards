 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic matter (OM) fluxes between and within terrestrial and oceanic reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon cycle. A clearer understanding of OM dynamics is critical for understanding fundamental processes and effects on greenhouse gases and climate. At present, researchers have an abundance of analytical methods and tools for investigating dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling, but the field struggles to move past a qualitative understanding of sources, processing, and fates toward a quantitative understanding. Researchers from University of California-Davis, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and Texas A&M University will develop biomarker tools to advance quantitative understanding of DOM cycling in riverine and estuarine environments in California, specifically targeting vascular plant and microbial markers. Results from this study will allow for future biomarker studies to quantitatively address DOM source and processing in aquatic environments and improve the limited understanding of the fate of terrestrial DOM in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This study will provide interdisciplinary scientific training and development for undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. Results from the study will be disseminated to the public, California stakeholders, and college students to educate them about the carbon cycle.",

This research aimed to advance our understanding of specifically dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics by improving the way the scientific community applies biomarker tools. To achieve this we developed and calibrated DOM source biomarkers for both vascular plant and microbial sources using microbial and coupled photochemical-microbial incubations of vascular plant leachates. We also developed a suite of data processing tools and novel database management to catalogue and identify any potential vascular plant and microbial markers released by the commonly used cupric oxide oxidation technique. These approaches highlight that despite our incubations starting with different source materials (i.e. different leachate endmembers) throughout the incubations convergence of DOM composition to a common composition was apparent. This highlights that despite differences in the composition of starting plant material, bio- and photo-degradation mechanisms produce DOM of similar compositions. Such convergence provides a compositional buffering capacity for aquatic systems where terrestrial material is a major contributor to DOM.&nbsp; Large-scale surrounding landscape changes may alter DOM source endmembers in riverine or lake systems, but initial differences in composition are quickly eliminated by degradation mechanisms such that the origin of the terrestrially-derived DOM is significant only when the material is fresh. As anthropogenic impacts (e.g. deforestation, conversion of lands to agriculture) and changes in climate alter the distribution of global terrestrial vegetation, compositional buffering will become a critical mechanism to maintain stability in aquatic DOM cycling. With the recalibration of biomarkers we also conducted sampling transects across the salinity gradient in the San Francisco Bay estuary in winter and summer to estimate degradation and production rates with and without significant photooxidation present using the calibrated biomarkers. Ultimately, our results highlight that terrestrially-derived DOM is more reactive than historically thought as biomarker data was interpreted incorrectly in previous studies.
