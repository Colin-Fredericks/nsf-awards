In addition to scholarship aid, the project is engaging scholars through a series of activities with a unifying theme of global environmental change, including cross-disciplinary and career-preparation seminars, service-learning projects which emphasize science communication, and capstone research experiences. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its comprehensive plan to support scholars through a rigorous cross-disciplinary academic program in an area of national need. Broader impacts include leveraging partnerships to support energetic recruiting for a diverse talent pool and to provide internship and career-advancement opportunities to connect graduates with the STEM workforce and graduate programs.",
