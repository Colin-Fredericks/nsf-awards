The focus is on the global networks engaged in the training of African scientists, specifically in the US and UK.  The ethnography will include extended oral histories, observation at lab meetings and at scientific advisory board meetings.\r\n \r\nResults of this study should offer suggestions on how to best train, support, and enable an emerging cadre of well-trained scientists working in this area. Results will be disseminated via a book and a web-based interactive narrative for high school and undergraduate students in the US and Africa.",
