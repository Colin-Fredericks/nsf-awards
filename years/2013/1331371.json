 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the ability of the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics Global Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) and the thermospheric extension of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM-X) to simulate middle and upper atmospheric odd nitrogen, specifically nitric oxide (NO).  The relevant NO chemistry scheme used by these models needs significant updates in rate coefficient and quantum yields based on recent improvements in laboratory measurements.  TIE-GCM simulations of equatorial NO compare poorly with observations.  Data from the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) data will be used to tune the model chemistry within the remaining uncertainties of the improved lab results.  The effect of the modified NO chemistry on simulated winds, temperature, energetics, and minor species will be evaluated.\r\n \r\n\tAccurate prediction of thermospheric odd nitrogen is crucial, as it influences the response of the thermosphere temperature and density to solar cycles and storms.  A version of the widely circulated GLOW model including these updated parameters and processes will be of benefit to the community while implementation of the revised NO chemistry in TIE-GCM and WACCM-X will enable more accurate simulation of the impacts of thermospheric NO variations.  In addition to the research, outreach activities to college and high school students will be carried out.",
