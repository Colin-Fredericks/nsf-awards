The probe temperature and thermal conductivity measurements will enhance the ~1 m depth heatflow determinations the main experiment will obtain. Improved assessment of possible bottom water temperature variation will be documented by deviations from linearity in the uppermost thermal gradient measured by the probe.  One day of shiptime to conduct heat probe work is confirmed, a second day is requested if ship schedule allows. Postcruise numerical modeling of these data aims to constrain temperature structure extending down to the subducting plate interface, which is related to deep seismicity patterns.",

This correlation suggests the presence of vigorous fluid flow within the oceanic basement.\n\nComparisons between these new measurements and those obtained by colleagues from the University of Washington are in general agreement. \n\nMore complete thermal models of the subduction zone are being completed at the University of Washington.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert N Harris"
