 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three goals of this project are to demonstrate a photomorphon (the basic building block of a smart material that changes shape in response to light), to interconnect photomorphons with light in optical fibers, and to use interconnected photomorphons to create novel devices.  Like the transistor, which endows integrated circuits with complex functionality, photomorphons interconnected with light will make photonic circuits with exceptional capabilities.  Each element within such a photomorphon network is both a sensor and an actuator, making a morphing material that intelligently changes shape in response to external stimuli.  This project is working from the ground up to develop new materials with enhanced photomechanical response, creating photomorphons from the new materials, and integrating these to explore applications enabled by morphing materials. Applications include tactile haptics and sensors, ultra-smart active textiles, and adaptive stretchable electronics, antennas and mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this project will be the scientific and engineering foundations that enable technologies that are unimaginable today. A tool-set is being developed to build photomorphon networks and to understand how to program them.  As proof-of-principle of a photomorphon device, this project is collaborating with physicians to make a light-actuated electrode positioner to be used for deep brain stimulation, which is currently in clinical trials and hold great promise for treatment of neural diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.   The focus on using light to bend fibers into arbitrary space curves is an excellent paradigm for exploring the connections with art, and connecting art with soft-matter science in a way that will attract curious and creative young students to explore exciting new research embodying the union of art and science.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on developing the intellectual foundations for a new device paradigm that would enable technologies that leapfrog the present state-of-the-art.  The wonders of our modern world are driven by the transistor, which controls the flow of electric current.  Many transistors acting together in an integrated circuit form the electronic brain that interprets data from sensors such as touch screens and accelerometers, and acts on this information to form images on a display or actuate machinery on an assembly line.  The shortcoming of present day technologies is that the logic chips, sensors, actuators and displays are separate, single-function units.  The Photomechanical Optical Device (POD) perform any one or all of those operations simultaneously at will.  An Interconnected network of them, using light rather than electricity, would make an ultra-smart morphing material of exceptional intelligence, adaptability and performance.  The primary figure summarizes the present day technologies and our vision of \"The Future\" made possible by our investigations.\n\nOur research spans materials development, thin film and fiber waveguide fabrication, theoretical modeling, material and device characterization, and demonstration of device concepts.\n\nA broad range of materials were synthesized and formed into thin films, thick films and fibers.  These included a variety of monodomain and polydomain liquid crystal elastomers and glassy polymers doped with dyes that change shape when excited with light, dyes that remain unchanged when exposed to light and carbon nano-tubes that efficiently capture light.  Other samples include those in which the dyes are chemically attached to the host material.\n\nGlassy dye-doped polymers were made into thin fibers of rectangular cross-sectional area with our unique fiber drawing tower and thin films were made with spin coating. Thick films of liquid crystal elastomer were made using stretch alignment and dye in-diffusion.\n\nTwo dedicated measurement apparatuses were constructed that simultaneously measure Young's modulus and photomechanical stress response of a thin film, thick film or fiber as a function of time, strain, temperature, pump wavelength and intensity profile while being probed with light at orthogonal polarizations.  The figure shows a photo of the \"First Generation Apparatus,\" which can be built by students for about $30 and used in undergraduate labs.  The results were disseminated in an article published in the American Journal of Physics.\n\nSuch measurements provide valuable information that can be used to understand the microscopic mechanisms that lead to a photomechanical response, which in turn can be used to design better materials.   The figure depicting \"Materials Characterized\" shows a tabulation of the measured properties of a sampling of materials, with their chemical structures shown below.  We find that dye-dope polymers have the largest efficiency (see FOM) for converting light into mechanical energy, but there is lots of room for improvement.  This data has been used to (1) better understand the origins of the photomechanical response, (2) understand how they can be leveraged to make practical devices and (3) develop new models of the response mechanisms.  This work was published as two invited articles in the journals: Advances in Optics and Photonics and the Journal of the Optical Society of America.\n\nIt will take decades to develop ultra-smart morphing materials, but nearer-term applications with significant impact on society are just around the corner.  We have used Deep Brain Stimulation as an example of an important medical procedure -- which treats Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease and others -- to which photomechanical optical fibers can offer real benefits.  Present day technology uses 1-2 mm diameter cylinders to deliver the electrodes to the target region of the brain, which displaces brain tissue when inserted, and can cause further damage as the cylinders are repositioned.  Photomechanical fibers, which are much thinner (about a couple hundred microns) can be steered with light, reaching the target area with more precision and causing less damage.\n\nThe \"Deep Brain Stimulation Figure\" shows the fabrication of a corrugated fiber that has the required snaking motion for steering and an X-ray image of the standard deep brain stimulator.  The figure \"Making Fibers with Electrodes\" shows the process that we have developed for adding metal wires to polymer optical fibers with waveguiding cores that have a photomechanical response, demonstrating that the individual pieces of the technology work.  Finally, we have made \"Biomimentic Mock Brain\" tissue from gelatin as shown in the figure.  A large range of compositions is tested to identify the one that most closely matches the viscoelastic properties of brain tissue.  We have demonstrated that leads can be connected to the tiny gold wires, meeting the requirements for applying an electric field to the brain.   Finally, a polymer optical fiber that is guiding red light is maneuvered into the mock brain to demonstrate the concept without the need for using a real brain.\n\nWhile all of the pieces are in place to make a deep brain stimulator, the project fell just short of animal then human clinical studies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark G Kuzyk"
