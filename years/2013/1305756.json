 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Tianbo Liu of the University of Akron will explore the properties of soluble macroions which represent a missing link between simple ions and large colloids.  The research has three components: first, experiments will be performed to determine whether the self-recognition of macroions can be achieved under extreme conditions, such as tiny differences in charge, shape, extra ligands or center metal ions. In the second part, self-recognition amongst enantiomeric macroions and chiral counterions (or co-anions) will be studied. Finally, potential applications of the self-recognition feature in materials science, such as separating/purifying functional materials or chiral catalysis will be pursued. The proposed work could have impacts on other research fields, such as physical chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, biochemistry, materials sciences and nanotechnology. The project also involves training graduate and undergraduate students, as well as visiting local high schools to interact with the students and encourage them to participate in national science competitions and to pursue scientific careers in the future.\r\n\r\nSelf-recognition involves a molecule, or larger entity, that can selective \"recognize\" and associate with itself in solution or even a more complex mixture.  This phenomenon is a universal and critical behavior in biological and chemical systems and leads to many important properties.  This research seeks to further understand the self-recognition behavior of macroions (very large charged molecules) in solution, in order to enhance our fundamental knowledge of how the self-recognition occurs, what are the critical driving forces behind this phenomenon, and whether it can be achieved in chemical process that mimic biological ones. This research could provide scientists additional evidence to understand certain unsolved biological processes and might lead to potential applications such as catalytic materials or materials for separations and purification.",
