 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists studying the evolution of life history strategies examine trade-offs between traits to understand how natural selection acts to maximize reproductive success. One fundamental trade-off occurs between the size and number of offspring: an organism can produce many small offspring, or just a few large offspring. There is a large body of theory explaining how these strategies affect reproductive success, but in animals, tests of this theory have been done in only two groups: vertebrates and sea urchins. The proposed research uses experimental embryological techniques to test theory in a much more diverse suite of animals, including members of two of the three major lineages of bilaterally symmetric animals: deuterostomes (hemichordates and echinoderms) and lophotrochozoans (annelids, flatworms, and molluscs). \r\n\r\nThe proposed work integrates research and education at two institutions focused on providing meaningful student research experiences. The grant will support the development of a series of web-based lesson plans that will be made available for adoption by any institution of higher learning. These lesson plans will be developed through a series of pilot programs run during introductory and upper level biology classes at both institutions. The grant will provide direct support for 8-10 undergraduates and one graduate student, while lesson plans will provide in-class research opportunities for hundreds of additional students.",
