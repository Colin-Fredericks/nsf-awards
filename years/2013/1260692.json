 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine biological pump is one of the primary pathways via which anthropogenic carbon dioxide may be sequestered from the atmosphere and exported to the deep ocean as organic carbon.  While the link between nutrient supply and high primary productivity in upwelling regions is well established, factors controlling the organic carbon export efficiency of upwelling ecosystems are not well known.  Scientists from the University of Southern California and Pomona College plan to determine the factors that control the rates and magnitudes of two components of biological production, Net Community Production (NCP) and Gross Primary Production (GPP), as well as particulate organic carbon export efficiency, at the San Pedro Ocean Time Series, a coastal site in the California Borderland during periods of minimal and high upwelling velocity over a 2-year span.  At this site, past and ongoing observations of hydrography and carbon rain will provide an historical context for interpreting results and mechanisms at work.  \r\n\r\nRates of NCP and GPP will be quantified at different upwelling intensity, using dissolved oxygen to argon (O2/Ar) ratios and the oxygen triple isotope composition of dissolved oxygen (O2).  The export of organic carbon will be established using 234Th (thorium) profiles in the water column, coupled with floating sediment trap deployments, and the development of a carbon isotope balance for the water column.  Upwelling will be characterized using non-steady state budgets for atmospheric 7Be (beryllium) input and its depth-integrated decay, as well as estimating rates based on remote measurements of wind stress curl and budgets for dissolved inorganic carbon and silicon. Application of the O2/Ar ratio and the oxygen triple isotope approach will require depth-integrated profiles of these tracers to evaluate the impact of upwelling on mixed layer inputs and use of non-steady state models during seasonal transitions in upwelling.  The comprehensive data set to be obtained should provide insights into the organic carbon export efficiency under variable upwelling regimes and help to relate the satellite-based measurements of chlorophyll to the organic carbon export of these highly productive ecosystems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  One graduate and one undergraduate student from the University of Southern California and two undergraduate students from Pomona College would be supported and trained as part of this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe ocean has a \"biological pump\" which acts to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from surface waters through photosynthesis, and export it, primarily as particulate organic carbon that sinks into the deep ocean.  This activity sequesters the carbon into the deep ocean where it can no longer mix with the pool in the atmosphere.  Consequently, understanding the details of these dynamics is important in predicting how our atmosphere, and its impact in regulating climate, will respond to perturbations in atmospheric CO2 that are being caused by human activities.  Only a fraction of the carbon fixed through photosynthesis is exported, as most is recycled by organisms that metabolize the photosynthetic carbon.  The fraction that is escapes metabolism is often described as N/G = (net carbon fixed and exported)/(gross rate of photosynthesis).  While the N/G ratio at open ocean sites has been measured previously, little work has been done in the coastal zone, where seasonal upwelling facilitates episodic algal blooms, resulting in globally significant carbon export.\n\nThe major goal of the project has been to test a classic question, which is: Do surface ocean ecosystems adjust themselves to maintain a constant ratio of net and gross production (N/G), so that a constant fraction of the carbon fixed will be recycled regardless of the supply of nutrients, OR does the ratio of N/G vary with supply of nutrients in these upwelling areas?\n\nThis question was approached by making time-series measurements of in-situ (naturally occuring) tracers for both upwelling and production (net and gross)  at a nearshore site (SPOT),  in the San Pedro Channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island (Fig. 1).
