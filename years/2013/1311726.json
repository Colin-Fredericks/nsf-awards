A conference on PDEs and Dynamical systems in biology will take place on September 30 - October 4, 2013 at Department of Mathematics, Bar Ilan University, Israel. The main purpose of the conference is to attract researchers working on PDEs and Dynamical Systems to problems in biology. Modeling and mathematical analysis in the areas of Cell Biology, Collective Motion, Biomedical problems and Population Biology will be emphasized in the talks at this conference. The talks will also identify biological problems where PDEs and Dynamical systems could provide a novel insight. \r\n\r\nA significant presence of young scientists is planned. The primary focus will be the facilitation of interactions between young and senior researchers working in the exciting and rapidly developing field of mathematical biology. The conference organizers plan to invite about 25 participants: 10-12 plenary speakers and 13-15 young researchers (graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty). In addition, several minisymposia will be organized.",
