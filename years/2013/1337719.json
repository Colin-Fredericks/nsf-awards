 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: To acquire a nano-imprint lithography system to support device and materials research in the Houston area.\r\nIntellectual Merit: Nano-imprint is a power tool enabling 50-100 nm technologies and eliminating the need for e-beam lithography. Incorporation of nano-imprint in an educational facility will enable students to gain insight into the imprint process. \r\nBroad Impact: The proposed research has a broad impact in micro and nano-fabrication technologies. A \"nano-engineering minor\" exists in the university and they aim to enhance this program, and the acquisition of this new instrument will help their program. The existing team is quite large consisting of over sixty (60) graduate and undergraduate students, whose research projects will benefit from nano-imprint lithography capabilities. \r\n\r\n",
