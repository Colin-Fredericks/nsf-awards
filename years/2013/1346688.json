 "awd_abstract_narration": "GENI, the Global Environment for Network Innovations, is a suite of research infrastructure rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large social-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for \"at scale\" experiments in future internets. Nationwide experiments began in Summer 2010. In the intervening three years, GENI has shown rapid growth in adoption by experimental researchers and is now expanding to over 50 GENI-enabled campuses.\r\n\r\nThis project will implement four coordinated thrusts that consolidate important GENI gains and advance the maturity of GENI as it progresses through its \"at scale\" deployment phase. This work positions GENI to be maintainable, expandable, and broadly usable for research and energizes the GENI community to sustain the powerful growth momentum that is carrying GENI forward.\r\n\r\n* Build and deploy experimenter tools that make GENI easier to use for a growing community. \r\n* Create processes and institutions to carry GENI into the future. \r\n* Stretch and test GENI's experimental capabilities. \r\n* Introduce GENI to industry, research leaders, and students through direct engagements that make GENI relevant in their work by partnering with product developers and service providers and by bringing GENI-based curriculum into college and university classrooms.\r\n\r\nGENI allows academic and industrial researchers to perform a new class of experiments that tackle critically important issues in global communications networks, issues such as our ability to understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks, issues associated with the barriers to innovation in the current Internet, and issues related to the resilience and trust needed of our critical infrastructures. GENI is emerging as the prototype of a system for deploying and managing custom combinations of computation and communication. As such it is potentially a model for the next generation of commercial network infrastructure.",

GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for \"at-scale\" experiments in future internets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including the following:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Experiments ranging from small to &ldquo;at-scale&rdquo; experiments.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with today&rsquo;s Internet.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today&rsquo;s Internet and that engage large numbers of users.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">A variety of classroom and research experiments.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although GENI&rsquo;s goal is to support &ldquo;at-scale&rdquo; experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure &ldquo;as big as the Internet,&rdquo; which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to &ldquo;GENI-enable&rdquo; existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they can support end-to-end experiments.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>GENI's Results</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways. The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI&rsquo;s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite. (See <strong>Figures 2 and 3</strong>.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GENI continues to see explosive growth in usage for both research and education &ndash; over 12,000 unique users have turned to GENI, allocating over a third of a million GENI configurations. (See <strong>Figure 4</strong>.)&nbsp;GENI&rsquo;s user base reaches more than 180 US universities and over 30 countries. (See <strong>Figure 5</strong>.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Under this award, the GENI community greatly expanded GENI&rsquo;s tool base as well as experimenter and educator resources. These new capabilities proved extremely effective when combined with GENI&rsquo;s nationwide deployment, incorporating sixty GENI racks and twenty-four GENI wireless base stations at universities, regional and backbone networks, and partner institutions across the US. GENI hardware and concepts are increasingly extending beyond GENI proper and being integrated with campus scientific computing infrastructure. More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the <a href=\"http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIBibliography\"><span class=\"s2\">bibliography of GENI-relevant publications</span></a> now includes over 350 entries.</span></p>\n<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; min-height: 14.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Arial; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Arial; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 14.0px} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} -->\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms.

These prototypes provide a valuable proof-of-concept environment that has paved the way for additional SDX research, including national and international interoperability, even while fostering the continuing development of competing and complementary SDX concepts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure. Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of <em>slicability</em>&nbsp;and <em>deep programmability</em>&nbsp;are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See <strong>Figure 6</strong>.)

This community is designing and developing GENI technology, deploying GENI on their campuses, and using GENI in their research. Many universities are applying GENI in their courses, with the potential to transform totally how experimental computer science is taught and learned.\nPerhaps most important to us, the GENI community, is that the newest generation of networking and distributed systems researchers have enthusiastically taken up research leadership roles in an ambitious project of national importance. We would like to congratulate the numerous academic and industrial groups &ndash; both Principal Investigators and many graduate students &ndash; who play a role in defining and shaping GENI.\nMark Berman, GENI Project Director\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Berman"
