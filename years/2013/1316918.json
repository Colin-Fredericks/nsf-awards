 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Lingyun Miao of University of Rochester to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. The project title is \"Optical Delivery for Ultra-High Density Magnetic Hard Drives.\" The host scientist is Associate Professor Paul Stoddart.\r\n\r\nEnergy-assisted magnetic recording is one of the most promising future technologies for nano-scale magnetic recording. It requires the use of a focused laser beam to define magnetic recording feature, where high efficiency optical coupling and delivery of highly focused optical beam at low cost are key challenges. This research collaboration is designing nano-sized metallic structures that greatly reduce the spot size of incident optical beam. Properly engineered such structures can generate highly focused optical spot on the scale of tens of nanometers, which facilitates magnetic recording density beyond one terabyte per square inch.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Specifically, this project can not only advance the research of ultra-high density magnetic recording, but also benefit the relevant research societies due to its interdisciplinary nature.",
