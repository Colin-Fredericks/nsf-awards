 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects are ideal model systems for studying associations between animals and microorganisms because of the diversity of interactions formed between them. These interactions, or symbioses, span a wide continuum of types, from those that are pathogenic and short-lived to those that are beneficial and stable over extremely long periods of time. Sap-feeding insects in particular have been shown to form intimate and stable symbioses with bacteria that live exclusively within insect cells. This strict intracellular lifestyle has profound effects on the symbiotic bacteria, effects that are dramatically manifest in their highly reduced genomes. This project will investigate a symbiosis involving a cicada that lives in the southwestern United States and its dual bacterial symbionts. One of these symbionts, named Hodgkinia, has a remarkably small genome encoding many fewer genes than was thought possible for an autonomous organism. The investigators will use both genetic and molecular techniques to uncover the mechanistic changes that have allowed Hodgkinia's extreme genome reduction. It is expected that adaptations in both the host insect and symbiont will be found that enable such dramatic gene loss. This work has broad-reaching consequences for the way we understand genome reduction in bacteria, the integration of organisms in the context of intimate symbioses, and the formation of cellular organelles such as mitochondria. The broader impacts of this project will involve the training of several undergraduate students, one graduate student, one postdoctoral fellow, and several K-12 teachers and students through collaboration with the Missoula County Public Schools and College of Education and Human Sciences at the University of Montana.",

Some of these bacterial genomes were so small that they rivaled mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes in size and number of genes. Aside from size, it appeared that insect endosymbiont genomes were also unusually stable in structure, sometimes changing little over millions of years of evolution. But we had little idea how these insect endosymbionts actually survived with such small gene sets, and how far-reaching this genomic structural stability extended. This project aimed to explore the similarities between insect endosymbionts and organelles. We found that the small size of some insect endosymbiont genomes was supported by gene transfer from other bacteria to the host insect genome. We found that the structural stability of insect endosymbiont genomes was not strict: some endosymbionts show wild structural instability, in a fascinating unknown parallel to mitochondria. We found that endosymbionts could be replaced by fresh bacteria surprisingly easily. In a side project, we found that most large lichens had a previously unknown fungus living in their outer layers. All told, the work we completed in this project has helped uncover the remarkable similarities between the classic cellular organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) and insect endosymbionts. The work helps clarify the generalities of endosymbiosis, and shows that many of the features thought to be unique to organelles are more likely a function of where they live&mdash;inside a host cell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: Collectively, the outcomes of this work have been reported in 14 primary research papers, reviews, and opinion pieces.

I co-organized a National Academy of Sciences Sackler Colloquium to gather experts to reevaluate the differences and similarities between organelles and endosymbionts (the meeting, titled <em>Symbioses Becoming Permanent: The Origins and Evolutionary Trajectories of Organelles</em>, took place 15-17 October 2014 in Irvine, CA). The papers from this project have been highlighted in over 20 articles in the popular press, including multiple articles in the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, and the <em>Atlantic</em>, as well as numerous other national and international media outlets. We collaborated with science writer Ed Yong for his <em>New York Times</em> bestselling and award-winning book, <em>I Contain Multitudes</em>, which featured our work supported by this award.
