 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating advanced, compact ac-tuator technology, called Gear Bearing Drive (GBD) Technologies to fill a technology gap in the robotics and motion control industry that requires a new generation of actuators able to exhibit a number of desirable characteristics ranging from high power density and high efficiency, high positioning resolution, high torque capacity and torsional stiffness, lightweight designs and low-cost packages.  The Gear Bearing Drive or GBD is a compact mechanism with two key abilities. It operates as an actuator providing torque and as a joint providing support. This is possible be-cause of the novel combination of external rotor (outrunner type) DC motor technology and Gear Bearing technology. The GBD is a bearingless powered joint with large power density. It utilizes a unique two stage planetary gear arrangement that allows a high reduction ratio while maintain-ing a compact form factor. The project accomplishes its goals by completing three specific ob-jectives: A) To fully analyze, characterize and experimentally test existing preliminary proof of concept prototypes of GBD; B) To develop and fully characterize experimentally advanced pro-totypes of GBD optimized using design for manufacturing approaches; C) To integrate a series elastic and torque sensing element with the GBD to facilitate human-machine interaction in GBD powered systems.\r\nIn this project Northeastern University will be partnering with the start-up company Foodinie to investigate commercialization of the GBD. Foodinie, located in New York City, aims at de-veloping and commercializing novel robotic systems for assistance of the elderly at home. Food-inie is interested in developing both a novel robotic system actuated by the GBD and GBD actu-ated joint modules that could be sold as standalone components to other manufacturers. The PI and Northeastern University have recently been issued US patent 8,016,893 (Sep. 13, 2011) for this invention.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is the design, advanced prototyping and thor-ough testing of an innovative compact, advanced actuator assembly that could find immediate commercial application in important markets such as rehabilitation, medicine, aerospace and others. The GBD will considerably improve the torque density and mechanical efficiency of ac-tuated robotic joints, and enhance the portability and effectiveness of robotic systems engaged in biomechanical applications such as rehabilitation robots and wearable exoskeletons.\r\n The current market size for robotic devices is 12 billion dollar with an expected expansion to 25 billion over the next 5 years. This market includes established manufacturing, defense and aerospace industries and emerging medical/health markets in prosthetics, bionics, and rehabilita-tion robotics. The GBD has potential to permeate all of these markets to varying degrees. These market opportunities seem large and with the validation attained from this investigation, we ex-pect to be able to attract and secure venture capital support for commercialization of the GBD.\r\nThe specific educational, broader impact and outreach activities of this project are: 1) The in-itiation of undergraduate students (including students from under-represented groups) in research in robotics; 2) The establishment of collaborative projects in advanced actuators and robotics with the science and technology high schools of Massachusetts with the objective to attract new students in this field; 3) The organization of a one semester I-cubator (student) project on market analysis and business planning for the proposed GBD technologies; 4) The establishment of a seminar series and of a webpage in the area of advanced actuators for robotic systems; and 5) The performance of graduate and undergraduate student internships in industry.",
