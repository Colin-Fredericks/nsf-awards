 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical processes play a dominant role in controlling the inter-annual variability of summertime hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay. The classical model for the development of hypoxia in the Bay assumes a simple one-dimensional balance in which biological oxygen demand exceeds the vertical supply of dissolved oxygen through the pycnocline by turbulent mixing. The PI's recent work suggests a new model for the modulation of hypoxia in which dissolved oxygen is supplied to the sub-pycnocline waters not through direct vertical mixing, but rather through the interactions of lateral circulation and mixing near the boundaries. It is hypothesized that wind-driven lateral circulation is the dominant mechanism that supplies dissolved oxygen to regions susceptible to hypoxia, and that the effectiveness of this mechanism is sensitive to both wind direction as well as estuarine bathymetry. This is supported by both numerical simulations and historical data, but comprehensive field measurements are required to adequately test this hypothesis. The overall research objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how physical forcing, including winds, tides and density stratification, modulates dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay. This objective will be achieved through a comprehensive examination of the interactions between circulation, density stratification and estuarine bathymetry and how these interactions ultimately govern when and where the turbulent scalar (salinity, temperature, and oxygen) flux occurs. The public awareness and local importance of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay make it an ideal socio-scientific issue for a comprehensive context-based education plan for students and the general public in the greater Hampton Roads area. The educational activities in this project will promote an interdisciplinary examination of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay that highlights the interactions between biological and physical processes and stresses the role of science in shaping public policy.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Understanding how circulation interacts with density stratification to control when and where turbulent scalar flux occurs is a fundamental problem in coastal and estuarine oceanography. It significantly impacts a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes and exerts a first order control on hypoxia. Hypoxia is one of the most pressing water quality issues facing coastal and estuarine waters, yet there are few if any detailed studies that resolve the turbulent mixing processes that modulate dissolved oxygen. The measurements collected here  will represent the most comprehensive examination of turbulent mixing in Chesapeake Bay, including unprecedented measurements of the direct turbulent flux of oxygen.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The scientific goals of this study are of fundamental importance to assessing efforts to restore water quality in Chesapeake Bay. The results from this research will help regulatory agencies and policymakers better design and assess restoration efforts in this economically and ecologically important estuary. The educational activities of this proposal are designed to promote scientific literacy about the issue of hypoxia by targeting both the general public and students across a wide range of educational levels. The development of the Summer Hypoxia/Anoxia Research Program (SHARP) will provide unique research opportunities for undergraduate students, specifically targeting underrepresented minorities through a partnership with Hampton University. The integration of hypoxia into the Chesapeake Interactive Modeling Program (CHIMP) will provide a powerful tool for educating the public about one of the most important water quality issues in Chesapeake Bay. This new tool will be made available to the extensive group of educators already using the original version of CHIMP, and it will be used to educate middle school students involved in the Mentoring Young Scientist Program and the general public through a display at the Virginia Aquarium.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLow dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) is one of the most economically and ecologically important water quality issues facing estuarine systems like Chesapeake Bay.  There is a general understanding that increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients result in increased algal growth, and that the decomposition of this material increases the extent and severity of summertime hypoxia in bottom waters.  Yet, in Chesapeake Bay studies that directly related nutrient inputs to the volume of summer hypoxic water fail to explain a majority of the year-to-year variability.  The primary goal of this study was to assess the role that physical processes play in controlling this variability.  Processes such as the magnitude of river discharge into the Bay, the strength and direction of winds, and water temperature all play a role in modulating the extent and severity of hypoxic water.   This study used a combination of intensive field observations and numerical simulations of the Bay\u00c6s circulation to provide a comprehensive understanding of how physical mixing processes modulate hypoxia.\n\nAn important tool for studying oxygen dynamics that was developed during this project was a simplified way of modeling dissolved oxygen in a three-dimensional circulation model.  The approach assumes that the biological processes that modify oxygen concentration are constant in time and space, isolating the role of physical processes.  Despite the simplicity of the approach, the model demonstrates remarkable skill at reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of hypoxia, clearly illustrating the fundamental importance of physical forcing.  Results from this research demonstrate that seasonal variations in wind speed and direction are the most important physical variables controlling the seasonal cycle of hypoxia.  At longer time scales, the variations in summer wind forcing play an important role in controlling inter-annual variations in hypoxia.  The simple model was applied to the 30-year period from 1984-2013, and was able to capture a statistically significant fraction of the observed variability in summer hypoxic volume.  Even though the model has no biological variability, over the 30-year period it captures 50% and 58% of the observed variability in hypoxic volume for the months of July and August, respectively&mdash;the two months when hypoxia is most severe.  The variations in hypoxic volume also are significantly related to the total nutrient load to the Bay from the Susquehanna River, demonstrating that both nutrient loading and physical processes contribute significantly to the observed inter-annual variability.   \n\nDetailed field observations collected during this project provided a clear understanding of how wind driven circulation supplies oxygen to bottom waters.  When winds blow along the main axis of the Bay, there is a strong lateral (across Bay) response of the bottom hypoxic waters that is caused by the rotation of the Earth.  This advects low oxygen bottom water onto the shallower shoal regions where it mixes with more oxygenated water and exchanges oxygen with the atmosphere.  When the winds relax, this water returns to the deeper channel carrying increased levels of oxygen.  Thus, oxygen does not reach bottom waters by direct vertical mixing, but rather by the interactions between vertical mixing and the lateral circulation.  Similarly, there are regions in the Bay where the bottom depth shoals rapidly in the along-channel direction.  When winds blow down the estuary (from the north) there is strong surface convergence in these regions resulting in downwelling and mixing.  These mixing hot spots supply oxygen to the bottom waters that is then advected up the Bay by the near bed residual currents.  Oxygen can be transported long distances by this process and is an important pathway for reducing hypoxia. \n\nThis research has not only provided a clear understanding of how physical forcing modulates dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay, but it has qua..."
