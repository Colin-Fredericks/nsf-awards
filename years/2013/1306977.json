 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Marcey Waters from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study the fundamental molecular recognition properties of a set of synthetic receptors for each of the methylation states of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), which are protein modifications involved in the control of gene expression.  The receptors will be developed using Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry, which will allow for rapid identification of a set of differentially selective hosts. Comprehensive mechanistic studies will be performed in which both the host and guest are varied that will provide insight into mechanisms for selective recognition between closely related guests in aqueous solution.   Lastly, these same receptors will be used in indicator displacement assays coupled with pattern recognition to characterize the enzymes that methylate Lys, providing new insight into these biological pathways.\r\n\r\nMolecular recognition, which involves the interaction of two (bio)molecules through a set of weak intermolecular forces called non-covalent interactions, is critical to virtually all biological function, including the interactions of proteins with other proteins, biomolecules, and inhibitors.  However, the ability to predict the set of non-covalent interactions that will give rise to a particular molecular recognition event with a certain binding affinity and selectivity is still not possible. This work will provide a systematic study of a set of biologically relevant molecular recognition events to gain mechanistic insight into the features that provide both affinity and selectivity.  This research will educate both graduate students and undergraduate students in organic, analytical, supramolecular chemistry, and biochemistry, providing a strong interdisciplinary background, which is necessary in an increasingly interdisciplinary workforce.  This work will also introduce underrepresented high school and college students to interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModification of proteins (called post-translational modifications or PTMs) influence their function.  These events are highly regulated in the cell, but if they are dysregulated, this can lead to disease.  PTMs in histone proteins are of particular interest, as histones package DNA in the nucleus and are important in controlling gene expression.  Because of their role in development and disease, there is significant interest in developing sensors for PTMs.  Two types of PTMs that are particularly prevalent in histones are lysine methylation and arginine methylation, where methylation refers to addition of a methyl group, consisting of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms, and lysine and arginine are two amino acids in proteins.  Moreover, lysine can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, and arginine can be mono- or dimethylated, with two different types of dimethylation (symmetric and asymmetric).  Thus, there is a significant challenge in differential sensing of each of these types of methylation.  This project aimed to (1) determine the rules for selectively sensing the different methylation states of lysine and arginine and (2) develop sensors for them.  Our approach was to develop synthetic receptors that bind to the PTM of interest, determine the rules for gaining selectivity for different PTMs by characterizing the factors that influence the selectivity of the receptors using both experimental and computational methods, and then use this information in an iterative design process to improve the properties of the receptors.  We then coupled the receptors with two different types of turn-on fluorescence signals to provide a sensor with a fluorescent readout for the absence or presence of a PTM of interest.  Using this approach, we established rules for selectivity, including the role of pocket depth, the influence of charged groups near the PTM, and the effect of electrostatic interactions.  Using this information, we improved both affinity and selectivity by 10-fold from our initial receptor to our redesigned receptor for trimethyllysine.  We also established rules in terms of pocket shape of the receptor for gaining selectivity for methylated arginine over methylated lysine.  Using these receptors, we developed two different types of turn-on fluorescent sensors for PTMs.  One approach used pattern recognition in an \"artificial tongue\" approach, in which multiple sensors in a sensor array are used concurrently to sense multiple different PTMs.  Each PTM provides a unique pattern of signals from the sensor array, allowing for pattern recognition to read out the type of PTM. This method was powerful as it allowed us to sense more PTMs than the receptors were actually designed for, as it differentiated 13 different PTMs using 4 receptors developed for trimethyl lysine and dimethyl arginine.  The second approach was a first of its kind to the best of our knowledge, involving the covalent (irreversible) turn-on fluorescent tagging of any protein fragment containing the PTM of interest through binding of the PTM with a receptor.  This \"supramolecular affinity labeling probe\" provides  robust sensing method that cannot be washed away.  We demonstrated its utility by using it to measure the ability of an inhibitor to block an enzyme that removes a PTM.  This work provided a proof-of-principle that this probe can be applied to screening of enzyme inhibitors biologically or medicinally interesting enzymes.\n\n \n\nThis work has broad impacts in the ability to study the roles of PTMs in histone proteins and gene expression, and potentially develop new methods to diagnose disregulation of PTMs that plays a role in disease.  Furthermore, this work has had broad impacts in the training a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in the interdisciplinary fields of organic chemistry, chemical sensors, chemical biology, and epigenetics.  Finally, as part of this grant we have done outreach to communicate the importance of scientific research to the public through the UNC Science Expo, which attracts &gt;10,000 visitors of all ages each year.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marcey Waters"
