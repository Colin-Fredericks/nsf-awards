 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Andrew Zuza of University of California at Los Angeles to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, China.  The project title is \"Tectonic Development of the Tibetan Plateau: Insights from the Qilian Shan Thrust Belt.\"  The host scientist is Professor Rui Gao.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cenozoic evolution of Qilian Shan thrust belt, along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, is fundamental in understanding how continental deformation and shortening induced by the India-Eurasia collision is accommodated across the plateau.  This research investigates the structural framework, fault geometries, and Cenozoic shortening magnitude of the Qilian Shan thrust belt by systemically mapping a transect of the thrust belt.  This surface geology is being compared with high-resolution seismic-reflection data recently obtained by the SinoProbe Project in order to see how mapped surface structures continue at depth.  Furthermore, this work involves mapping active faults that are responsible for producing large (momentum magnitude scale greater or equal to 8) earthquakes.  Increased knowledge regarding these faults is valuable for evaluating the seismic hazards associated with these structures.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
