By sharing a diverse (by age,\r\ngender, and ethnicity) set of success profiles of Young Makers widely in the formal education\r\nsystem to students, K-12 school administrators, university leaders, admissions officers, and to\r\nYoung Makers both online and at Young Maker community events, we aim to illuminate\r\npathways for Young Makers to become the engineers of the future. In addition, this study could\r\ninform future innovation in formal K-12 STEM pedagogy based on successful attributes of\r\ninformal engineering education and tinkering activities.",

Through interviews with 4 dozen Young Makers Makers (and 3 dozen of their parents) at flagship Maker Faires in the US, our research team has captured maker educational pathways, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes developed during their Making activities and might prepare them to pursue advanced STEM education and careers. The results of this study can transform the conversation of who Young Makers could become, linking Making with engineering in the same way that students who excel in science and math are pointed toward engineering by parents and career counselors.\n\n \n\nimpact / benefits of research\n\nResults suggest the following understanding of the Maker community:\n\nWhat Making Means. Participants collectively defined \"making\" as \"making something.\" It matters less what the creation is but more so the act of creating and building an artifact.\n\nAdditive Innovation. Participants actively practice additive innovation, where they contribute to an open community of sharing and learning. Citizenship in the Maker community means additively building on the work of others and freely sharing knowledge and processes back with the community. The Making community is an additive innovation network, both as a social and intellectual community.\n\nMaking in Informal Spaces. Making encourages students to be creative lifelong learners, and can be beneficial to both formal and informal modes of STEM education. In making-based museum environments, parents were found to take multiple roles of builders, designers, facilitators, teachers, environment formers, and cheerleaders when supporting their children.\n\nMaking contrasted with formal learning. Young makers contrasted their Making with their experience in school with science fairs. Participating in Maker Faires, study participants believe, provides more applied learning about science, engineering, and community concepts as compared to their participation in science fairs.\n\nSelf-Direction and Knowledge acquisition. Young Makers draw inspiration from their interests and make within their existing personal context. They seek out formal and informal mentors that can be experts or near-peers and peer with a little bit more knowledge. Young Makers learn a variety of skills and knowledge to create technically sophisticated artifacts of personal interest in their informal making activities. Makers learn how to communicate technical details to a wider audience, some learning valuable techniques to foster lifelong learning, some learning how to apply engineering knowledge to solve problems, and some learning specific skills applicable to electrical engineering and manufacturing engineering programs in college.\n\nLifelong learning and developing expertise. Prototyping and building provides a specific means to acquire adaptive design expertise. A disposition to apply skills to develop work prototypes can provide a breadth of experience. By attending the Maker Faire, where they can exhibit anything from a functional prototype to a start-up?s minimum viable product, Makers are able to receive feedback from the Maker Community, and expand their learning ecology or learn from others? past experience.\n\nIdentity formation as Makers, as STEM thinkers. Further examination of Young Maker identity could provide insights into the psychosocial process of \"becoming\" a Maker as well as a tool for helping educational institutions refocus their efforts on creating opportunities for students to develop their Maker identities through Relational-identity and Preferential-identity prior to Material Discourse-identity and Affinity-identity.
