 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent fossil discoveries have provided increasing evidence that early human ancestors engaged in a variety of forms of locomotion, combining some type of terrestrial bipedal walking with varying degrees of arboreal behavior.  It has been difficult to interpret these differences, however, in part because we have very limited modern analogies to compare with the fossil forms.  The goal of the present study is to determine how differences in locomotor behavior in modern gorillas are related to differences in skeletal characteristics, in order to better reconstruct the locomotion of early humans from their fossil remains.  \r\n\r\nGorillas constitute a group of closely related species and subspecies that have recently diversified, both genetically and ecologically.  Eastern mountain gorillas inhabit high altitude environments that encourage very little arboreal climbing behavior, while western lowland gorillas inhabit rainforest environments where climbing is a common activity.  There also is a geographically intermediate group of gorillas that inhabits both high and low elevations and that shows a mixture of locomotor behaviors.  Using museum specimens from varying gorilla populations,  limb bone structural properties will be determined using computed tomography and other measurements, and compared between the different groups.  It is hypothesized that limb bone strength proportions will more closely reflect differences in locomotor behavior than will other skeletal characteristics.  Growth studies of western lowland and mountain gorillas also will be carried out and compared, using juvenile skeletal material from the same populations.  It is known from behavioral studies that mountain gorillas undergo a change in locomotor behavior during growth, becoming less arboreal as they become older, while this is less true for western lowland gorillas.  It is hypothesized that limb bone strength proportions in the two groups will be more similar in infancy and diverge thereafter.  \r\n\r\nThis project will add significantly to our understanding of genetic and environmental effects on skeletal morphology and growth.  It involves an international collaboration between the PI and researchers in Belgium and Finland, and provides training for two graduate students.  The data generated by the study also will promote understanding of living gorilla ecology and population history, which will aid in conservation efforts for these Endangered species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGorillas represent a very interesting, and in some cases endangered, set of closely related species and subspecies that range across much of equatorial Africa.  They also vary in behavior depending on their environments.  Western lowland gorillas live in dense tropical forests and climb trees regularly for food and to sleep.  Eastern mountain gorillas live in high elevation environments with fewer trees, and are almost completely ground-dwelling once they pass infancy.  There are other eastern gorillas that are closely related to but genetically distinct from true mountain gorillas, and who live at both low elevation and higher elevations and are intermediate in locomotor behavior.  By comparing the bone structure of these different groups, we can gain a better understanding of the relative importance of inheritance (genetics) and environment in determining how the skeleton grows and adapts to different forms of locomotion.  This in turn can give us insights into how to interpret variation in bone structure among fossils, including early human ancestors who were just beginning to walk on two legs. \n\nIn this study, we examined variation in bone structure in 301 gorilla skeletons from museum collections, including both adults and juveniles.  When we compared the adults, we found that the relative strengths of the bones in the arm and leg reflected how much time they spent in the trees (arboreal) versus on the ground (terrestrial).  However, other features of these bones, including their lengths and the size of their joints, did not vary between the groups.  When we examined juvenile gorilla bones from the different groups, we found that they all started out looking very similar, but that they diverged in strength at about the same age that locomotor behavior diverged.  In contrast, their lengths and joint sizes were never different.  Thus, bone strengths are responsive to changes in behavior during growth, while bone lengths and joint sizes are not.  Because gorilla groups only separated relatively recently, there has not been enough time to evolve different limb length and joint size proportions.  However, because strength proportions can change during growth depending on behavior, they do vary between the groups.  This kind of information can help us resolve some problems in interpreting early human fossils, and in determining how arboreal or terrestrial they actually were.\n\nOur results are also useful in evaluating the significance of variation in body form among living gorillas in terms of both their genetic histories and current environments.  This is important from a conservation standpoint, for example, in interpreting how distinctive different groups are in both behavior and body form.  Some of the data were collected in Rwanda, near an area where mountain gorillas have been studied for many decades.  When these gorillas die of natural causes, their skeletons are saved and collected for scientific research.  By studying these skeletons, we can gain insights into their behavior and ecology that can help in designing the best strategies for future protection of this critically endangered subspecies. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher B Ruff"
