 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the network infrastructure at the University of Connecticut (UConn), in both the main campus  at Storrs and the Health Center at Farmington, to enable data-intensive research. Specifically, the project (1) constructs a  Science DMZ at the Storrs campus that provides an aggregate access bandwidth of 100Gbps to its regional network provider, (2) re-architects  the current Science DMZ at the Farmington campus and increases its access bandwidth from 2Gbps to 100Gbps, and (3) establishes a 40Gbps  layer-2 connection between the Storrs and Farmington campuses dedicated to scientific traffic between these two campuses.     \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is expected to significantly increase data transfer rate to specific projects in physics, geography,  statistics, biology, bioinformatics, quantitative cell biology and simulations, and computational genomics, directly benefiting research  in a wide range of disciplines. The enhanced network connectivity will also make an impact on closely interlinking the two campuses,  fostering multidisciplinary research that can lead to scientific breakthroughs. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will enhance the capabilities of researchers to host data and share data with researchers in other institutions,  which can benefit a larger community of researchers. The proposed infrastructure will also facilitate our current GENI educational activities  by providing a platform for computer networking courses and training programs. The researchers participating in the project will  continue their current practice of involving minority and underrepresented students in research, and will disseminate their research outcomes  to the scientific communities through journal and conference publications.",
