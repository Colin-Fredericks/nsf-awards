 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project asks whether civil legal assistance can affect recipients' perceptions of judicial processes and institutions and their development of civic skills. This project tests a theory of policy feedback--the reciprocal effect of policies on those who interact with them--and applies it to legal services.  This project hypothesizes that the realization of the enforcement of the civil law for one's self and working with a legal service provider could lead to increasing belief in political and civic effectiveness and increasing civic skills.  Further, it is expected that interactions with a legal service provider will enhance an assessment of procedural fairness and support for both justice institutions and government institutions more broadly. To test these theoretical expectations, the investigators will administer a survey to people with civil legal concerns before, during, and after their contact with legal assistance in order to assess its civil and political impact.  The project's intellectual merit stems from its contribution to what researchers know about policy feedback by considering as yet untested mechanisms by which individuals encounter legal institutions.  Currently the method of service delivery and access to it have not yet been considered in extant literature.  The project's broader impacts include collaboration with service providers to develop more sophisticated measurement tools and evaluation of the effects of service provision, as well as better understanding of the development of skills relevant to civic and political efficacy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nApproximately 2 million people seek out free civil legal services each year, but only about half of them actually receive services due to limited resources.  Although scholars have dedicated much effort to understanding the economic and remedial impacts of the receipt of civil legal aid, little is known about the micro-democratic consequences &ndash; the ways in which legal aid might provide opportunities for service seekers to participate in democratic processes &ndash; for those receiving services.  We also do not know if negative consequences exist when legal aid institutions deny services to those seeking them out. Civil legal aid provides a unique case for investigating how people interact with institutions, as free civil legal assistance is not universally guaranteed, and organizations with varying designs and missions administer it. \n\nThis project argued that the receipt of civil legal aid confers positive micro-democratic consequences on those who receive legal aid, while the non-receipt of services confers negative consequences.  It also argued that individuals would experience variations on these positive and negative consequences based on the type of legal aid institution they visited.  These hypotheses were tested through comparisons of pre-service and post-service surveys and interviews across different types of legal aid institutions in two major metropolitan areas in the United States.  The analyses largely confirmed the theoretical expectations, but also identified that there may be a difference between formal and informal understandings of \"the receipt of services.\"  In the following sections, the intellectual merits and broader impacts of the project are briefly discussed.\n\nIntellectual Merit. First, the project expanded upon previous work on the policy feedback approach, which is used to study the reciprocal effects institutions have on those who utilize them, in the United States context.  It did this by expanding the scope of policy feedback theory, arguing that not only universal or means-tested programs fit into the framework, but that the provision of non-guaranteed services could also confer micro-democratic consequences on users.  Further, because the policy feedback approach does not encompass the provision of services with limited resources, or the provision of same service by different types of institutions, this project helps explain variation within a policy category.  Second, this project introduced a methodological approach to the study of micro-democratic consequences by adapting a pre- and post-service methodology, which is more commonly used in the civic education literature.  It did this by surveying and interviewing individuals both before and after they received civil legal aid in order to measure the change in perceptions of efficacy, confidence, and skills usage related to the legal institutional environment.  Third, the project challenged the traditional notion of the receipt (and non-receipt) of services.  Studies in this field typically utilize objective measures of the receipt of services to determine the connection between services and outcomes.  However, in this project, service seekers were asked to determine if they thought they had received legal aid from a particular office.  The study found that the percentage of people thinking they received services was far higher than national estimates for the receipt of services. Those reporting the receipt of services experienced positive change in their perceptions of efficacy and confidence in the legal environment, as compared to those reporting the non-receipt of services, who experienced a negative change in these areas of interest.  Finally, those who visited a legal services office that was of the restricted type, and therefore unable to provide the same range of opportunities for micro-democratic consequences as an office with a different institutional design, experienced moderated positive effects (when receiving services) or enhanced negative effects (when not receiving services).\n\nBroader Impacts.   First, the project was written up as part of a completed book-length dissertation project, and will be edited for a series of journal articles for peer-reviewed publication.  This research has also helped the co-PI develop undergraduate courses with sections on the civil legal aid environment in a comparative context, inequality and justice, and the right to counsel.  Second, the project has allowed for undergraduates and law students (JD, LL.M.) students to be trained in and engage with social science research.  In the hiring of research assistants, the co-PI targeted underrepresented groups in the social sciences.  Third, the project has forged interdisciplinary connections &ndash; both theoretically and empirically &ndash; across the disciplines of political science, law, sociology, and education.  Fourth, the project has reached scholarly and practitioner communities of interest through conference presentations and meetings, and has been presented in ways that are accessible to a variety of audiences. Finally, the project has demonstrated a new category of consequences for legal aid seekers, which stands to motivate additional research and practical innovation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alyx Mark"
