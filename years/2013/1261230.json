The workshop is entitled, \"50 Years of the Seismology of the Sun and Stars,\" and it is important to note that the year 2013 is an important milestone in helioseismology, being the 50th anniversary year of the discovery of the 5-minute solar oscillation.\r\n\r\nThis NSO workshop will bring together solar and stellar seismologists, theorists, and observers on the occasion of completing 50 years of helioseismic investigations, in order to discuss recent scientific advances and plan for future research.  The workshop will be structured to include invited talks on various key topics, to be followed by contributed talks, discussions, and posters. \r\n\r\nThe Organizers plan to publish proceedings of the workshop within a time frame of six months.  These proceedings will represent an historical overview of the scientific results in helioseismology over the last 50 years.  This document's purpose is to help young new researchers understand the historical development of the field, as well as to aid in planning future instrumentation and the theoretical interpretation of future observations.  Based on NSO's past experience with this kind of workshop, the Organizers expect the participation of a large number of graduate students, women, and underrepresented minorities, all of whom will be recruited to attend.\r\n\r\nThe committee members are planning for this event to be limited to about 60 to 70 attendees and they intend use this NSF award to provide partial travel support for 10-14 participants representing the categories of invited speakers, young researchers, and under-represented researchers.",
