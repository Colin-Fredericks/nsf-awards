 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long been puzzled about why there are so many species of trees in tropical forests; the answer is not obvious. Recent evidence suggests that disease microbes hidden in the soil may play an important role in determining how many species can grow in a given area. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis are lacking, though. This project employs a combination of experiments, plant pathology, and cutting-edge genetic approaches to test whether interactions between trees and disease agents in the soil determine tree species composition in tropical forests of Panama.  The study is unusual in the amount of detailed data collected on distributions, identities, and host specificity of many types of largely unknown pathogens.  \r\n\r\nChanges in species composition of soil pathogens as a result of human-caused disturbances and agricultural practices are well documented. However, the impact of such changes on land restoration is poorly understood. This study will provide critical insights to scientists as they search for more effective conservation and reforestation techniques.  Because this project is highly collaborative, it will also provide broad training to U.S. and Latin American students in the ecology of plants and microbes.  Finally, the lead scientists will work with the Missouri Botanical Garden to publically demonstrate the importance of soil microbes to the health and sustainability of both natural and agricultural plant communities.",
