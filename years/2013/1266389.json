 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active predation has been considered a powerful selective pressure for at least 500 million years, ever since animals evolved eyes, teeth, and jaws.  Traits which have been proposed to be evolved adaptations to predation pressure in primates and early human ancestors include alarm calls, large body size, large group size, group-living itself, increased vigilance, avoidance of high-risk habitats, and greater cognitive abilities.  Empirical evidence to both document actual predation pressure on primates and to then assess evolved and co-evolved traits in the context of predator-prey relationships, however, has been extremely difficult to acquire.  A number of significant predators for primates are active at night, limiting data acquisition, and the presence of human observers studying primates in the wild likely discourages predation during other times.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in remote sensing technologies, such as the use of GPS-tracking collars, now provide a mechanism to systematically and more fully document the interactions between predators and prey. This research will utilize these technological innovations to assess predator-prey behavior and interactions between two primates, baboons and vervet monkeys, and their likely major predator, leopards, in East Africa.  These primate species are terrestrial and occupy savannah-woodland habitats, conditions relevant to much of the developed theory on adaptations to predation, and they are frequently utilized in reconstructions of early human ancestral lifeways.  Spatial data from the GPS collars on individuals of all three species, along with data from voice-activated recorders that document nocturnal attacks at primate sleeping sites, will generate unprecedented and detailed records of the frequency of predator-prey interactions, predation rates, prey vulnerability, and prey responses.  Because baboons and vervets differ in body size, group size, habitat use, ranging behavior, and types of alarm calls, these data will enable us to test long-standing but heretofore untested hypotheses about these presumed, evolved adaptations to predators.\r\n\r\nThis project provides research and training opportunities for a US postdoctoral researcher and a Kenyan graduate student.  Its broader impacts are further expanded by being based at Mpala Research Centre, a facility jointly maintained by US and Kenyan organizations.  It strengthens collaborative relationships between US and Kenyan organizations and aids local community conservation and education efforts through its contributions to Mpala.  Finally, the data from this project will inform conservation efforts to better protect carnivore and primate species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to increase understanding of the interactions between primates living in savannah-woodland/bushland habitats and leopards, their main predator.  Until recently this has not been possible largely because researchers traditionally follow primates on foot, which discourages leopards from hunting.  Now, however, the application of Global Positioning Systems attached to collars worn by animals has made it possible to monitor the movements of target animals remotely.  In this project, using GPS, we recorded the movements of target animals every 15 minutes around the clock for 12 months.  Target animals included 12 vervet monkeys in five groups, six baboons in four groups, and four leopards.  In addition, at one of the sleeping sites of the primates, we ran an audio recorder each night from 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM, and camera traps continuously day and night, for 12 months.\n\n \n\nIt is well known that vervet \u00e6leopard\u00c6 alarm calls benefit group members because they respond in an appropriately evasive manner.  One outcome of this project was the discovery that vervet alarm calls to leopards also function as a predator deterrent.  Vervets gave leopard alarm calls more frequently around dusk and dawn whereas photographs from camera traps showed that leopards approached vervets more closely during the night.  Thus, although leopards could be nearby during all monitored hours, they approached more closely when vervets gave fewer alarm calls.  GPS data showed that leopards also moved away, and changed direction while doing so, within minutes after alarm-calling began.  Leopards likely move away because the alarm calls alert not only vervets but also other prey species, which makes hunting more difficult. \n\n \n\nWe also found that when people and leopards were within 200 meters of each other, most often it was because people in vehicles approached the leopards.  When this happened, leopards typically stayed in the same area until after the people left.  One case, however, involved a leopard approaching people who were unaware of the leopard and then moving away from them.  These results suggest that leopards can become used to people to some degree.\n\n \n\nThese results begin to reveal the dynamic nature of interactions between leopards and human and non-human primates.  Ultimately, our research will be applied to reconstructing the behavior of ancestral humans because they were also prey for leopards. \n\n \n\nThis project supported the training of a Kenyan research assistant, the education of a Kenyan graduate student, and continued professional opportunities for an American postdoctoral researcher.  We gave 102 high school and undergraduate students the opportunity to contribute to scientific research when they screened over 5000 hour-long audio files for vervet alarm calls to leopards.  The project also offered an American graduate student field experience and data to be analyzed as part of his dissertation, which involves leopard-human conflict.  Leopards are classified as \"near threatened\" but can be killed when they eat domestic livestock.  This research will help local people who are potentially economically affected by leopard depredation to make informed management decisions to protect their livestock in ways that also protect leopards.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynne A Isbell"
