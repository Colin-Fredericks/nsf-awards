It has been held since 1985 in rotation at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, Stony Brook University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina and New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.  It will be held April 12 - 14, 2013 at the University of Maryland, in April 2014 at Stony Brook University, and in April 2015 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Geometry Festival is to expose and explain the major recent accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and faculty, and to advance discoveries in the field by bringing together present and future experts in a supportive atmosphere, with special attention to and financial support for under-represented groups, graduate students, and young faculty.
