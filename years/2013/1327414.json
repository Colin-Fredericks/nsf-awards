The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation. The GEC has an enviable reputation of being the first conference that many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students. This award pays partial travel support for PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this proposal include the opportunity for young scientists to attend one of the most important conferences in their field.

The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.",
