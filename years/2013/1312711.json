 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will study the behavior of physical and biological systems in the presence of noise and/or disorder.  These factors are ubiquitous in applied and fundamental science and models of real phenomena have to take them into account. Mathematical models of noise are based on stochastic differential equations (SDE), studied using techniques of probability theory, dynamical systems and partial differential equations.  In particular, we willinvestigate the effective behavior of SDE systems as the noise correlation, response delay and other relevant time scales become small. Noisy systems of many interacting particles (microrobots or bacteria) will require additional statistical physics methods to describe their collective behavior.  In the quantum case, other mathematical techniques will be brought in:  coherent state transform and methods from quantum field theory.  All of the above systems will be studied in the light of the new results about entropy production.  In addition, systems with quenched disorder will be investigated, including interacting bosons in a random potential.  Two types of randomness---noise and disorder occur jointly in models of diffusion in a random environment.\r\n\r\nIn nontechnical language, noise refers to random time-dependent factors, relevant for systems behavior (random forcing or thermal fluctuations, for example), while disorder means random parameters which do not change significantly in time (e.g. random environment or random structural defects). We will study several effects coming from both kinds of randomness, using methods of probability theory and theoretical physics. Interaction with experiment will go both ways:  the developed theory will explain existing or planned experimental results and, conversely, will lead to a design of new experiments.  The scope of the work includes diffusion in classical and quantum physics, quantum disordered systems and many-particle systems relevant for applications in biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMATHEMATICS OF NOISY AND DISORDERED SYSTEMS\n\n \n\nReal systems studied in science are always subject to random perturbations.  These perturbations can vary in time, taking the form of a random noise, or can affect the system in a time-independent way as a quenched disorder.  Effects of either type of randomness can be complicated and multifaceted.  This project studied such effects, its main focus being behavior of noisy dynamical systems.  It was established that presence of noise leads in general to emergence of an induced additional force (technically:  noise-induced drift), which can have a significant influence on the system's time evolution.  A quantitative formula for the noise-induced drift was derived.  Additional effects of this type were established for systems which respond to the noise source with a time delay.  The mathematical findings were confirmed by laboratory experiments, and led to a number of new projects under current study.  In particular, self-organizing behavior in systems of interacting agents was described mathematically and realized by a system of small robots, with a potential application to search and recovery, as well as medical tasks.  The essence of the established effect is, that depending on the delay with which moving agents react to the environment they collectively create, they will either tend to aggregate in a small area, or disperse and stay far away from each other.  In man-made systems, the delay can be varied externally, leading to desired changes in collective behavior.  These results were selected by the American Physical Society as one of its foci. Impact of disorder on statistical mechanics was also studied; in particular progress in the notoriously difficult theory of spin glasses was made.\n\n \n\nUltimately, noise is a physical system is a result of its interaction with the environment.  Such systems are called open.  The methods developed in this project promise further progress in the theory of open quantum systems, which is understood in less detail than its classical counterpart. \n\nThe three-year research effort funded by this award is a part of a long-term project by the PI and his collaborators, in which numerous properties and effects coming from the presence of noise and/or disorder are and will further be studied.  The project involves international and interdisciplinary collaboration with several research groups and provides an ideal training environment for young researchers .  Most of the PI's work on the project has been done, and continues being done in a collaboration with graduate students, having led to five Ph. D. degrees since 2009. \n\nIn summary, several important effects of randomness were established, theoretically, as well as in experiments performed by PI's collaborators.  Their significance includes a deeper understanding of noisy dynamics, progress in theory of disordered systems, potential applications to collective behavior in the presence of noise and a new methodology to study open quantum systems.  Continuation of this program is on the way, with a focus on applications of general principles to particular systems.  A new effort, in which both disorder and noise play crucial roles, and which is specifically targeting biological applications is being started.   Participation and training of young researchers and graduate students was, and continues to be an inherent part of the whole project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jan Wehr"
