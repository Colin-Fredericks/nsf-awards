 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participation of students, postdocs, and early-career faculty in the 10th International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology, Barcelona, Spain, July 8th -12th, 2013.  Morphology, the study of form or shape, is the foundational field for a diversity of areas of biological research including developmental biology, biomechanics, paleontology and evolutionary biology.  Symposium topics are forward looking and interdisciplinary, and include sessions on Hominin evolution, the function and evolution of the nose, the function of non-contractile components of muscle and the curation and analysis of 3-D data.  The Congress will bring together leaders in the field from around the world, students and post-doctoral fellows, and integrative scientists from related disciplines. The international nature of the meeting is an excellent opportunity for students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty to develop productive collaborations with non-US researchers and to gain new insights and perspectives about the conduct of scientific research and infrastructure in different countries. The funding will be used to partially offset the travel and registration costs for 25 presenters at the meeting.  Travel support provided through this award will be aimed at broadening participation in the meeting ensuring that greater numbers of women and members of underrepresented groups of US researchers will be able to attend. Among other broader impacts of the Congress will be the (1) integration and communication of research, (2) enhancement of research infrastructure through the encouragement of partnerships and collaborations, and (3) broad dissemination of research through publication of abstracts and posters.  The posters will be available through the open source Faculty of 1000 web site.",
