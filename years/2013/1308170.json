 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the NSF Chemistry Division funds Dr. John Magyar from Barnard College to study the energetics and dynamics of cytochrome c from the cold-loving (psychrophilic) microorganism Colwellia psychrerythraea.  The protein will be studied by a variety of structural and spectroscopic methods, including UV-visible absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopies; X-ray crystallography; and electrochemistry.  In particular, roles of noncovalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds and cation-pi interactions) and ligand substitution reactions in psychrophilic protein folding will be investigated. This work will provide insights into how cellular processes such as electron transfer and energy storage occur with reasonable rates at decreased temperatures.\r\n\r\nColwellia psychrerythraea, the organism whose protein is investigated here, played a major role in natural hydrocarbon degradation processes following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Unlike most previous oil spills, which primarily affect the ocean surface and the shoreline, the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill occurred in deep, cold water.  In this unusual environment, different microorganisms were involved in the natural cleanup. The work funded by this award adds to the scientific understanding of how microorganisms can live and thrive at low temperatures.  These insights will lead to greater understanding of protein dynamics and intramolecular interactions, with relevance to bioremediation, solar energy utilization, and global biogeochemical cycling. In addition, the project will provide research experiences for undergraduate women at Barnard College and science outreach efforts to elementary and secondary students in New York City.",
