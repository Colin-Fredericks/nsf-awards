 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human society is faced with an increasing number of problems including\r\nstubborn diseases and international security/climate threats. The\r\ncomputer simulations and advanced data management methods necessary to\r\nsolving these societal problems can only be realized through increased\r\nuse of parallel computing at all system scales, including desktops,\r\nservers and the cloud. Efficient large-scale parallel computing\r\nhowever requires advanced parallel programming methods. Such methods,\r\nunfortunately, have a greater proclivity for software bugs that\r\nincrease cost through lost cycles on super-computers and these same\r\nbugs undermine confidence in simulation results.  This research\r\naddresses the challenge of developing parallel computing software by\r\ncreating new scalable methods to support advanced parallel programming\r\nmodels that provide rigorous guarantees on program correctness. The\r\nsocietal impacts of this work stem from increasing reliability of\r\nsoftware powering the national infrastructure, advanced educational\r\nmethods to train future generations, and pedagogical material in the\r\nform of course notes and software for broad dissemination.  It also\r\nhelps maintain the United States in a leadership situation with\r\nrespect to the available talent pool in this area.\r\n\r\nProviding rigorous guarantees on correctness of existing parallel\r\ncomputing software requires that two classes of methods be developed,\r\nevaluated, and taught widely: scalable code-level (static) checking\r\nmethods, and downstream detailed (dynamic) checking methods. This\r\nproject develops these novel and much-needed correctness checking\r\nmethods around the Habanero Java programming and compilation\r\nsystem. The research is to augment the system with correctness\r\nobligations emitted during compilation and checked at all later stages\r\nof translation and deployment.  A key highlight of the project's\r\napproach is that it allows some of the correctness obligations to be\r\nchecked statically in the context of safe subsets of Habanero Java.\r\nObligations that are not able to be statically checked, especially for\r\nlarger subsets of the Habanero language, are marked for checking\r\ndynamically through novel active-testing methods. An Operational\r\nSemantics written in the Coq notation lends cohesion to the work by\r\nensuring that the division of correctness checking between static and\r\ndynamic techniques is sound. In summary, this research helps advance\r\nthe science of parallel programming in terms of rigorous correctness\r\nchecking methods, while at the same time contributing to the broad\r\npractice of programming at all scales from desktop to cloud\r\ncomputing and high-end scientific simulations.",
