 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction complexes such as the Franciscan Complex of California contain large volumes of rock that have been exhumed from up to 40 km depth, and which preserve a record of the ambient physical conditions and deformational processes. In particular, the South Fork Mountain Schist (SFMS) in the Northern Coast Ranges is a 240 km long and up to 5 km thick body of intensely deformed sedimentary and volcanic rock that occupied the subduction zone interface at around 123 Ma, at a depth and temperature corresponding to the source area of present-day episodic slow-slip and seismic tremor (ETS) events. The SFMS preserves an extraordinary high-strain deformational microstructure that indicates the activity of a combination of microcracking, pressure-solution and dislocation creep at relatively high stress, burial depths of around 40 km, and temperatures of around 350 degrees C. The SFMS offers an easily accessible window into the physical conditions and deformational mechanics during ETS events. This project quantifies (a) deviatoric stress using recrystallized grain-size piezometry on rocks affected by dislocation creep, (b) strain and strain-rate using the estimated subduction rate for this period, the thickness of the deformation zone, and microstructural features including microfold geometry and deformed clastic quartz and radiolarians, (c) temperature using laser Raman spectroscopy on carbon and the Ti content of quartz, (d) pressure (and hence depth) using phase assemblages in the blueschist-facies rocks, and multi-equilibrium thermobarometry on coexisting chlorite and white mica, and (e) water activity using cathodo-luminescence and FTIR analyses on quartz. These measurements will allow thermomechanical modeling of the effect of dissipative heating, and calculation of the rate of moment release, which can be compared with the seismic record during ETS events. Elastic modeling of the rate of crack propagation will allow calculation of the rate of fluid transport and the rate of propagation of slip events.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful and damaging earthquakes known occur between 15 and 40 km depth in regions known as subduction zones where oceanic plates are being carried down into the Earth's mantle. Below that, there is a transition downwards from the abrupt movements that cause earthquakes to steady sliding without earthquakes. This transition produces several types of ground motion, including \"slow earthquakes\", in which slip continues for up to two weeks, but without ground shaking. The transition may play a role in building up the stress that produces normal earthquakes at shallower depths. This project investigates rocks in northern California that were formed in a subduction zone at about 40 km depth, and which preserve a record of the physical conditions (pressure, temperature, stress, and water content) and processes that lead to slow earthquakes and related phenomena in present-day subduction zones.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to investigate a topic of considerable current interest among earthquake scientists, which is the origin of a range of phenomena known as ?slow earthquakes?.  These occur mainly in subduction zones around the Pacific, and in particular along what is called the Cascadia Margin, where ocean lithosphere is being carried down beneath the North American continent along a subduction zone that extends from northern California to central British Columbia.  Slow earthquakes involve slip of a few mm to tens of cms along the subduction zone without the generation of an earthquake.  Large ones can be detected by satellite geodesy, and may last from two weeks to several months.  They are commonly accompanied by seismic tremor, which consists of seismic waves with low amplitude and frequency, unlike normal earthquakes.  They typically occur at depths of 25-50 km or more in subduction zones, below the depth at which the characteristic highly destructive subduction zone earthquakes are produced. \n\nThe aims of the project were to discover the geological signature of these phenomena in rocks that have been brought up to the surface from a depth of 35-40 km in the ancestor of the current Cascadia subduction zone, which are exposed in the northern Coast Ranges of California.  These rocks, known as the South Fork Mountain Schist, were deposited as sediments in the Pacific Ocean, carried down in the subduction zone about 125 million years ago, heated up, deformed, and transformed into metamorphic rocks known as blueschists, due to the presence of the characteristic blue mineral glaucophane. In the course of this project we investigated structures such as folds and faults preserved in the schist, analyzed the composition and structure of the minerals to determine the pressure and temperature in the subduction zone, estimated the stress that accompanied the subduction process from microscopic characteristics of the deformed rocks, and examined the physical and chemical processes that contributed to the deformation. \n\nOur overall conclusions can be summarized as follows.\n\n1)  The South Fork Mountain Schist and underlying rocks in the northern Coast Ranges consist of a number of rock slices, up to several km thick, produced by the progressive subduction of oceanic crustal and sedimentary rocks around 125 million years ago.  The South Fork Mountain Schist is the oldest of these slices, and reached the greatest depth in the subduction zone.\n\n2)  The South Fork Mountain Schist reached a depth of around 40 km in the subduction zone, and a temperature of 330-380?C.\n\n3)  Stress in the subduction zone reached values of 21-38 MPa (one MPa is comparable to a pressure of about 10 atmospheres).  These values are significantly lower than those produced by processes such as continental collision, but comparable to those associated with subduction zone earthquakes.\n\n4)  Deformation in these rocks took place by folding on a variety of scales, from 1 mm to 500 m.  Formation of mm-scale folds (microfolds) was accompanied by the opening of voids in the rock, initially filled with water, and then subsequently with quartz.  Our calculations suggest that the formation of these microfolds is capable of generating seismic tremor.  Coordinated formation of microfolds can generate the larger scale folds seen in the rocks, and could generate the slow earthquakes detectable by geodetic methods.  These processes could have accommodated ~30% of the displacement related to subduction during formation of the South Fork Mountain Schist.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John P Platt"
