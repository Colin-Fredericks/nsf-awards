 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to undertake an in-depth study of the class of binary-constrained (BC), mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCCs).  Such programs form a broad class of constrained optimization problems with binary variables where some of the constraints are described by the disjunctive condition of complementarity.  The latter features arise from a number of applied problems where the discrete variables are used to model binary decisions and the complementarity constraints are the result of some lower-level optimality or equilibrium conditions. Building on recent advances in the global resolution of linear programs with linear complementarity constraints (LPCCs) and their extensions to problems with convex quadratic objective functions (QPCCs), both with continuous variables only, this investigation will initially develop efficient solution methods for the global resolution of binary-constrained LPCCs and QPCCs.  Extensions of the proposed methodology to the broader class of binary-constrained convex mathematical programs with complementarity constraints will be the second phase of the investigation.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to improved understanding of such problems as optimal plant location in competitive markets, discrete-choice portfolio selection under risk, classification in medical decision making, and compressed sensing in signal and image processing, as well as many related applications in complex engineering and economic systems involving hierarchical decision making with logical constraints. Computational advances from diverse areas of optimization need to be integrated in order to effectively handle the discrete and continuous features of the problems under consideration. The integration of such subdomains of optimization and the expected theoretical advances in understanding the intrinsic properties of this new class of optimization problems form the intellectual core of the proposed project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder this grant we developed numerical algorithms for solving Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). This is a special type of optimization problem where some pairs of optimization variables are forced to be \"complementary\", meaning that component-wise one of the two variables must be set to zero.\n\nBroader Impact:\n\nMPCCs appear, for example, in the context of bi-level programming, which deals with optimization problems in which the set of feasible solutions is itself described in terms of a \"lower-level\" optimization problem.  This setting appears, for example, in game theory, where a specific player, often called the \"leader\", makes a first move, described by an \"upper-level\" problem, and then the remaining players, often called \"followers\", make their own moves simultaneously, described by the \"lower-level\" problem.

It is understood in bi-level programming that the followers' decisions also affect the leader's profit, so that there is an upper-lower-level interaction as well.\n\nAn example of a bi-level optimization problem is toll pricing. A government takes the role of the leader and decides for which highways a toll is introduced as well as the toll price, in order to maximize revenue induced by these tolls. The users of the highways become the followers, who get to choose which route to use, trying to minimize both their tolls expenses and their travel time. The interaction comes from the trade-off that the more cars use the same highway, the more congested it becomes and hence the travel times increase. Therefore, some drivers have the incentive to switch to a highway with tolls, willing to pay in order to reduce their travel time.  The interaction between drivers and the toll setting institution arises from the fact that large tolls decrease the willingness of drivers to pay and might result in less overall profit.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nTo solve an instance of a bi-level optimization problem numerically, it is common to replace the lower-level problem by its optimality conditions which characterize the relationships an optimal solution must satisfy.  Those conditions include complementarity constraints, so that, overall, the resulting reformulation is an MPCC.\n\nMPCCs are challenging optimization problems since they do not satisfy a crucial assumption under which standard optimization algorithms have been designed.  As a consequence, standard nonlinear optimization solvers for finding locally optimal solutions tend to fail or perform poorly, and specialized algorithms are required.  In addition, MPCCs are highly non-convex even when the problem functions are linear and finding the globally optimal solution is difficult.  The standard mixed-integer reformulations are only applicable when upper bounds on the complementarity variables are known, which is often not the case. Under this grant, two new algorithms were developed that address those issues.\n\nThe first algorithm seeks to compute locally optimal solutions for MPCCs with linear problem functions very quickly.  It is rooted in the difference-of-convex-functions algorithm (DCA), but a novel active-set prediction procedure is necessary to overcome the inherent slow convergence of the DCA.  This new technique speeds up convergence significantly and the resulting solver outperforms other types of algorithms.  Our approach is also able to escape from stationary points that are not local minimizers by choosing specific elements of the penalty function subgradient.\n\nThe second algorithm is a significant improvement of the Logical Benders Decomposition method, originally proposed by Hu, Bennett, Kunapuli, Mitchell, Pang (2008) and Bai, Mitchell, Pang (2013) that aims at finding a globally optimal solution.  In each iteration of this method, a new complementary assignment of the optimization variables, proposed by a \"master problem\", is evaluated until the optimal one is found.  To make this practical, the information obtained during the evaluation of a complementary assignment is used to derive \"cuts\" for the master problem which remove assignments that can be proved to be inferior.  As a consequence, only a small fraction of the exponentially many possible complementary assignments need to be evaluated.  The key outcome of this project is a novel master problem algorithm for choosing the next assignments to be explored, paired with a much more powerful cut generation procedure than previously available.  By removing many more assignments per iteration compared to previous approaches, this new technique was able to reduce the computation time by orders of magnitude and to solve larger test problems than previously possible.  What enabled this was the discovery of a previously unknown relationship between Logical Benders Decomposition and the Branch-and-Bound algorithm, an alternative procedure for solving MPCCs.  These insights made it possible to interpret the cuts in a new light and to generate them in a way so that their combined effect excludes many more assignments than before.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andreas Waechter"
