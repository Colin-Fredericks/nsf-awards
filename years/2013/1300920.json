 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a well-integrated collaborative experimental ? computational study of the mechanisms of nanoparticle generation in short pulse laser ablation of thin metal films and multi-layers in a liquid environment.  The key processes that control the generation of nanoparticles will be investigated in large-scale atomistic simulations and experiments performed for thin film targets embedded in common liquids, such as water, acetone, and toluene, and irradiated by short (femtosecond to nanosecond) laser pulses.  The detailed microscopic information on highly non-equilibrium processes of laser ablation and nanoparticle formation, revealed in the simulations, will be used to guide the experimental exploration of conditions that ensure fine control over the nanoparticle size distribution, structure and composition. The role of the spatial confinement of the deposited laser energy within the irradiated films and the interaction of the ejected ablation plume with liquid environment are among the key questions to be investigated computationally and in experiments.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will provide guidance for the design of experimental setups optimized for the generation of nanoparticles with structure and composition meeting the needs of particular applications. This will enable individual researchers to produce nanoparticles for their research projects that are not readily available commercially, or if they are, at a great cost. The generation of nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and free of contaminants has a good potential to impact many applications, including biomedical research, nanoengineering of advanced materials, optoelectronics, and surface catalysis. The close interaction between Rutgers-Camden, a predominantly undergraduate institution, and the University of Virginia, a research-oriented institution, will provide unique educational opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project is concerned with the creation of nanoparticles by laser ablation of metal targets that are embedded in a liquid.   This technique is valuable to researchers who require a relatively small amount of pure nanoparticles and can be extended to create alloys and nanocomposites. \n\nWhen a pulsed laser strikes a metal target in a liquid a plasma is created near the target surface.  In comparison with air, the plasma is highly confined in liquid and this further anhances the heating of the target surface that is caused by absorption of laser irradiation.  The superheated mixture of nucleating nanaoparticles and water expands away from the target surface in what is beast described as a cavitation bubble.  The bubble expands and collapses up to 4 times and causes secondary ejection of material from the target.  It also may result in the fusion of smaller primary nanoparticles into larger structures.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work strems from our demonstration of the  strengths and weaknesses of the technique through understanding the  mechanisms involved with laser interactions with the target and  subsequent secondary ekjection processes.  This will enhance the broader impacts by allowing researchers from different fields to use the technique.  We have also shown that it is possible to sythesize a great variety of nanoalloys through laser ablation in liquid along with post-irradiation.  This will aid researchers in diverse fields.\n\nOur primary research findings may be summarized as follows:\n\n1) The cavitation bubble dynamics and maximum diameter serves as a proxy for the efficiency of the ablation process under liquid.  The time it takes the bubble to collapse strongly affects the particle size and dispersity.\n\n2) Target micro- and nanaostructuring strongly influences the ablation yield and particle-size distributions. The presence of \"ridges\" in the target can serve as preferential sites for ablation and if the polarization of an incoming laser pulse is parallel to these structures, there will be an enhancement of surface currents and subsequent heating at the target surface during ablation.\n\n3) If thin films are utilized as targets, the process is dominated by the boundary thermal conductance, and is thus quite different than bulk. This is especially relevant when we create alloy nanoparticles by multilayer thin film structures.\n\n4) Silver nanoparticles created by laser ablation in liquids are especially effective as bactericidal agents when they are exposed to broadbanded light before being introduced to E. Coli cultures.  The light enhances photocatylitic production of Ag ions, possibly by reduction of AgO-Ag2O at the nanoparticle-liquid interface.\n\nThe broader impacts of this work are enhanced by the ability of undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines to participate.  Four undergraduates who have worked on this project have entered graduate programs in their respective fields including two who are first-generation college students and one who is an under-represented minority in physics.  The work has led to two new research projects and proposals that will be submitted in the Fall of 2016.  Finally, it has led to two MS thesis proposals in chemsitry.  One will be concerned with the creation of nanoparticles of new photovoltaic systems and the other will explore light activation of polymersomes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Bubb"
