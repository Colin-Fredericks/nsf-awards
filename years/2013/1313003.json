They will analyze high resolution optical and infrared spectra of 55 disks around stars that are at different stages of evolution in order to constrain thermochemical and 2-D hydrodynamical models of planet formation. Most of the necessary data are in hand, and new observations are planned with large optical telescopes, such as the Multiple-Mirror Telescope, Large Binocular Telescope and other observatories.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts training undergraduate and graduate students in research and professional development of science and math teachers.  The research team will also make presentations to the public, including on an episode of the SETI Institute radio show Big Picture Science.",
