 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Hui-Yiing Chang of Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project in MPS during the summer of 2013 at Korea Astronomy and Space Sciences Institute in Daejeon.  The project title is \"Testing the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect in Different Models of the Universe.\" The host scientist is Dr Yong-Seon Song.\r\n\r\nDark energy forms anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, resulting in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The ISW-LSS (Large Scale Structure) cross-correlation function, which shows the ISW effect on large angular scales, is derived. Relevant data from the nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations and the Planck mission results are employed, and the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System used to perform integration in the process. In conclusion, the ISW effect on the Viscous Dark Fluid cosmology, which will likely produce strong ISW signals, and the Inflection Point Quintessence cosmology, which will likely produce the opposite kind, is tested.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, a paper about the research results targeting physics amateurs will be disseminated to a broad audience, including through a non-technical journal. Presentation of the research will be proposed at national and international general science and interdisciplinary conferences that even involve the arts disciplines.  Coordination will be made with the Society of Physics Students at the author's home institution for launching an outreach program in the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) in Nashville, TN to make presentations at the 21 high schools and other schools where high school students are enrolled, which include the Baxter and Cohn Alternative Learning Centers, the MNPS Virtual School and the Cohn Adult High School.  The students will be introduced to the mystery of dark energy and its pivotal stance.  Then, the rest of the research will be presented in a systematic fashion through visual materials.  Due to the ethnic and socio-economic demographics of the student population in MNPS, a significant number of under-represented minorities in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields will be reached.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTitle: Dark Radiation from a Scalar Field\n\n \n\nCosmological observations have been generally consistent with the standard model of the Universe, the Lambda CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) cosmology.  However, there are some unresolved issues associated with this model.  The observed number of light neutrinos1, N_v = 3.  The \"effective\"2 number of light neutrinos, N_eff, has been found to be slightly higher though. \n\nWhen we include the effects of the partial heating of the neutrinos in the early Universe by electron-positron annihilation3, N_eff = 3.046.  The seven-year data from WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe4) combined with observations of baryon acoustics oscillations5 and measurements of the Hubble parameter6 H_0 give N_eff = 4.34.  Other recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background7 fluctuations are best fitted by values of N_eff  that are above 3.046.  This additional radiation component that is the cause for the measurements being above 3 cannot interact electromagnetically.  It has been dubbed \"dark radiation\". \n\n \n\nThere are many possible models of the Universe for dark radiation.  We examine a scalar field8 with an exponential9 potential10, (V_0) (exp_(-lambda*kappa*phi)).  Dark radiation evolves like the Universe\u00c6s radiation as the Universe expands.  It is an extra component in the Universe that scales like radiation in the radiation-dominated era and like matter in the matter-dominated era.  We seek to determine whether this behavior fits the observations or places limits on such models. \n\n \n\nWhen lambda = 5, for the values of V_0 = 10^49, 10^39 and 10^29, dark radiation behaved in approximately the same manner.\n\n \n\nWhen lambda = 5 and V_0 = 10^49, dark radiation decreases more rapidly than the other known components of the Universe (matter and scalar field) towards the present day.\n\n \n\nWhen lambda = 5, for the values of V_0 = 10^49, 10^39 and 10^29, the equation of state11, omega, of the Universe peaks later for each subsequent value of V_0.  In each case, omega fluctuates slightly, stabilizes for a long period, then falls.\n\n \n\nWhen lambda = 5 and V_0 = 10^49, the ratio of the energy density of the scalar field to the energy density of neutrinos decreases as the value of lambda increases.  The ratio approaches 0 as lambda approaches 20.\n\n \n\nThis project was continued upon my return to my home institution in the U.S.  The collaborators plan to write a paper within the next few months, for which we will seek publication in a reputable physics journal.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe criterion of intellectual merit is fulfilled by exploring an alternative model of the Universe that could better represent the Universe or provide ideas that lead to a better representation than the currently accepted one.\n\n \n\nThe criterion of broader impacts was fulfilled when I presented my research to the other fellows of the EAPSI program.  They reacted with interest and amazement at the behavior of the Universe under various circumstances.  That will, hopefully, encourage them to explore physics where it is related to their research since physics forms the foundation of the science and engineering disciplines.  This criterion will be further fulfilled when I present my completed project to diverse audiences to arouse their curiosity in physics so that more students end up studying the discipline.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.
