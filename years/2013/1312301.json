 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating microbial electrochemical technology into an efficient wastewater treatment and energy recovery system for food and beverage industry.   The translated technology has the following unique features: high pollution removal rate, small foot-print, and high power density, that provides exemplary performance and cost savings, when compared to the leading competing anaerobic digestion in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by determining the key design and operational parameters through the evaluation of microbial electrochemical cells with real waste streams, resulting in a fully functioning prototype reactor stack.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership engages Waste2Watergy to provide guidance in practical wastewater treatment and other aspects such as scale-up and commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to be a low-cost sustainable wastewater treatment and energy recovery technology in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in renewable energy generation and wastewater treatment.   The societal impact, long term, will be providing energy from a renewable source while benefiting human health worldwide.\r\n",
