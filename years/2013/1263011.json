 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advances of MAchine Learning in THEory & Applications (AMALTHEA) REU Site aims to provide top quality educational experiences to a diverse community of undergraduate students through research participation in the area of Machine Learning (ML). The relevance and importance of ML is not limited to specialized technological innovations, as it was in the past. Nowadays, it also increasingly influences everyday life through its contributions to applications such as voice/face recognition, credit fraud detection, intelligent recommendation systems and many others. Furthermore, ML is inherently multi-disciplinary as it draws from advances in disciplines such as computing, statistics, mathematics, physics, biology and engineering, to a name a few major ones. The project's thrust area is the theory of ML and how it can be integrated and applied to important real-life problems, thus exposing participants to both theory and applications. AMALTHEA involves 10 undergraduate students per year from a broad spectrum of disciplines for 10 weeks in the summer. These participants perform supervised research, whose results are going to impact the field of ML itself, as well as how ML is applied in other scientific disciplines. For this purpose, the faculty mentors have ample expertise in ML and past experience of effectively engaging undergraduate students into state-of-the-art research.\r\n\r\nOver its lifespan, the project will directly impact a diverse group of 30 motivated students, the majority of which may not have access to such research participation opportunities otherwise. The participants will be exposed to cutting-edge ML research, as well as professional development activities, such as technical seminars and career-related workshops. Furthermore, AMALTHEA aims to involve overall 10 graduate students in undergraduate teaching and mentoring activities during the summer experiences. Finally, the project's research and education endeavors are supported by its advisory board, which consists of seasoned educators, ML industry practitioners and researchers. Research results will be published in interdisciplinary conferences, and, potentially, technical journals.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site web site (http://www.amalthea-reu.org) provides additional information for students as well as educators and researchers in machine learning.",

AMALTHEA&rsquo;s research focus was Machine Learning (ML), its theory and applications in diverse domains. ML&rsquo;s technological and societal importance has grown exponentially in part because of advances in its discipline, technological breakthroughs that led to the abundance of cheap computational resources and, of recent, the realization of how much potential still lies latent in the processing of all this information stored, shared and communicated over the Internet. The project&rsquo;s 2 main objectives can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p>1. To recruit a diverse, talented undergraduate students from around the nation. In particular, to attract 10 undergraduate students every year from a variety of engineering and science disciplines. This REU effort was supported by a geographically-broad, national network of affiliate universities, some of which serve significant numbers of under-represented minorities and others offer only BS/BA degrees.</p>\n<p>2. To actively engage the recruited students into cutting-edge ML research and form a community of learners, which will foster and provide a valuable experience for undergraduate students through participation in research programs and high quality student/faculty interaction.</p>\n<p>In the years 2013 through 2015, the Program offered three 10-week long summer experiences, during which participating undergraduates were immersed in ML research. In this time frame, it recruited 10 undergraduate REU participants per year, a total of 30 students. 16 (~53%) students were from undergraduate institutions that offer limited research opportunities to undergraduates. Moreover, 10 of them were female (~33%) and 7 (~23%) were ethnic/racial minorities; overall, the Program involved 16 (~53%) students from groups that are typically under-represented in the engineering and computing disciplines. At their time of participation, 2 (~6%) had completed their freshman year, 14 (~47%) their sophomore year and 14 (~47%) their junior year. The students came from a diverse engineering and science background, such as Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics to name the most prevalent disciplines.</p>\n<p>During the summer experiences, these REU students were provided a foundation in ML, chose their research topics based on their interest and formed research teams around them consisting of two REU students, at least one graduate mentor (most often, a doctoral student) and a faculty mentor. Video highlights of these topics can be found in our YouTube channel (http://tinyurl.com/y5h8boww). Additionally, REU students attended a series of ML-related technical seminars and professional development workshops on aspects of technical writing, ethics in research and graduate fellowship opportunities. At the apogee of each summer REU experience, our symposia, each team presented their culmination of their research efforts to a wide audience consisting FIT students and faculty, as well as to REU Advisory Board (AB) members, whose role was to provide feedback to the Program. The AB primarily consisted of senior scientist/engineers and technical managers from local industry and government, such as the Harris Corporation, the Northrop Grumman Corporation, the Boeing Company, Alstom USA, many other smaller companies, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force Technical Applications Center based at Patrick Air Force Base to name a few.</p>\n<p>Towards the development of a globally-competitive STEM workforce, a matter of national priority, the Program's REU students were exposed to a variety of tools, technologies, approaches and real-world ML applications. The feedback we obtained over the years unequivocally reflects that they learned what research entails, how to technically/ethically conduct it and appreciate its importance and societal impact. They also acquired soft, but, nevertheless, essential professional skills, such as working in teams and effectively communicating their ideas and outcomes to a broad audience. Moreover, the impact on the REU students' attitude and aspirations towards graduate studies was significant. Beyond their participation in AMALTHEA, 14 out of 30 (~47%) pursued graduate studies (6 pursued M.S. and 8 pursued Ph.D. degrees in STEM). Of note is that 3 (10%) of them subsequently were awarded a prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; all three stemmed from under-represented groups and undergraduate (4-year) institutions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, over its lifespan, the Program involved 3 MS and 9 doctoral students as graduate mentors and 6 faculty mentors. Graduate mentors gained teaching/mentoring experience and developed leadership and project management skills by significantly contributing to their team's research effort. The Program directly or indirectly supported 44 technical publications in total. Of those, 23 were non-peer-reviewed: 15 technical reports, 1 M.S. thesis and 7 Ph.D. dissertations. The remaining 21 were peer-reviewed: 4 book chapters, 13 conference papers and 4 journal articles. Our REU undergraduates were co-authors of all technical reports. In total, a book chapter and 7 conference papers featured REU undergraduates as co-authors. Finally, the grant facilitated the forming and cultivation of close ties between FIT and the surrounding local industry and government.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Georgios&nbsp;C&nbsp;Anagnostopoulos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263011/1263011_10239899_1551148793754_AMALTHEA2013-Student_Participants-low_res--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263011/1263011_10239899_1551148793754_AMALTHEA2013-Student_Participants-low_res--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2013 AMALTHEA REU Cohort\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263011/1263011_10239899_1551148793754_AMALTHEA2013-Student_Participants-low_res--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2013 AMALTHEA REU Cohort\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our 10 REU students on the day of our 2013 Symposium at Florida Institute of Technology, in Melbourne, Florida.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgios C.
