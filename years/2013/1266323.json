 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division and the SusChEM initiative at NSF supports Professor Christopher Bielawski of the University of Texas at Austin to develop carbene-based catalysts that transform a broad spectrum of readily available starting materials (e.g, carbon monoxide, ammonia, dihydrogen, etc.) into valuable chemical products. The research builds upon the recent discovery of a stable carbene that, unlike the ubiquitous N-heterocyclic carbenes, is relatively electrophilic and activates molecules that possess inert bonds under mild conditions. As many of the activation processes are analogous to that of transition metals, the development and exploration of the chemistry of a series of electrophilic carbenes will be adapted in this research to harness their chemical potential and to promote a broad range of new metal-free, catalytic transformations. Beyond enriching the chemistry of carbenes while opening a new dimension in catalysis, this project contributes to our current understanding of chemical reactivity and structure, while establishing new tools for synthetic chemists.\r\nThe development of organic alternatives to current metal based catalysts, which often require precious and/or toxic reagents and operate under harsh conditions, is attractive from economic, environmental, and sustainability perspectives. This project also contains a significant teaching development component that enhances the synthetic chemistry curriculum at the University of Texas at Austin, and promotes the mentoring and leadership skills of involved pre-college, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral members. In parallel with the aforementioned activities, several diversity-oriented outreach efforts are directed toward increasing the numbers of students pursuing careers in science, technology and engineering fields, especially among populations that are currently underrepresented, through engagement in summer research and other educational outreach programs. Overall, the synergistic research, teaching, and outreach components of this project are designed to inspire, cultivate technical as well as problem-solving skills, and prepare future members of our nation's workforce for employment in high technology areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nElectrohilic Carbenes: From Fundamental Studies to Applications in Synthesis and catalysis.\n\n\nFederal Award ID: 1266323\nReport Submission Period: 05/01/2015 to 04/30/2016\n\n \n\n \n    This study led to the successful synthesis and characterization of a number of new compounds called carbenes.  These are typically very reactive substances that are difficult to handle and react with other molecules in an aggressive way.   By varying the structures of the carbenes, the students were able, to a very significant extent, control the reactivity of these materials and cause them to be surprisingly stable and selective in their reactions. The products of the study provide new understanding of the potential of this class of materials for use as catalysts and reagents of the sort used to prepare new products and intermediates including pharmaceuticals.  The work led to several publications and PhD dissertations.  \n\n \n    In the course of these studies we discovered two very interesting new materials.  One is a polymerization catalyst that we can turn off and on by exposure to light.  The catalyst can be used to make polymers that are valuable and familiar including polyethylene.   This work is not quite finished, but we will finish it and see that the information is made available to the scientific community through publication in scientific journals.  \n\n \n   The second material is a polymer that is stable under normal use, but undergoes rapid and efficient depolymerization upon exposure to short wavelength light or electron beams.  The products of the depolymerization are toluene, a volatile hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide, a gas.   Effectively, the solid polymer disappears when exposed to radiation.  We have successfully formulated new photoresists using this new polymer that are more radiation sensitive than classical resists such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and they produce high resolution images upon exposure to patterned electron beams.   These patterns are of the sort used to manufacture semiconductor devices.   Work on this material is not quite finished either, but we will finish it and see that the discovery is made known through student presentations at international conferences and publication in scientific journals.  \n\n \n     Several excellent students and post-doctoral fellows were supported during these studies.   The students have all earned or will earn PhD degrees and all of these students have found jobs in academia or industry.  We are particularly grateful for having had the opportunity to include several exceptional undergraduates in these studies.  These young people had a unique opportunity to experience high level research and learn how to design experiments, collect data and report their results in a professional manner.    All of those who have finished have gone on to graduate school and two are still active and will continue to be supported while we finish the work described above.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: C.
