 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholars Program at SUNY Oneonta is supporting two 12-scholar cohorts, each for 4 years, with scholarships of up to $5,400 per year.  Scholars are in the fields of Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, Mathematics, Computer Science & Statistics, Physics & Astronomy, or Environmental Science.  The project, based on a careful review of the literature, is meeting its specific objectives of (i) reducing the student-loan debt load at the time of graduation, (ii) improving educational outcomes for academically qualified STEM majors by leveraging existing support programs; (iii) providing new team-building activities, information science education opportunities, multidisciplinary educational experiences, and close student-faculty mentoring; (iv) encouraging undergraduate research and/or professional travel through financial incentives; and (v) enhancing opportunities for scholars to secure STEM-focused internships, careers, or opportunities for STEM graduate studies.  The project is continuing to evaluate scholar progress, satisfaction, and achievement, through 24 months post-graduation and is working both on institutionalizing program facets as well as disseminating findings.  Scholars, including those recruited via the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) or the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) are experiencing a student-focused environment, (supported by a multidisciplinary team of STEM educators) including S-STEM-specific freshman and senior courses as well as traditional academic and support services, all designed to foster scholar success.  Scholars are being challenged to think critically and to synthesize knowledge from across the STEM disciplines in answering questions about science and its impacts on society.  The project is enabling students, who would otherwise have significant barriers to overcome, to graduate and to then enter STEM careers or continue in advanced degree programs.",
