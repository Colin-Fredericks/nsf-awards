 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is critical to plant growth. A limited number of plant species have the capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria; the rest need to obtain their nitrogen through soluble forms of nitrogen present in the soil. For the majority of crop plants, nitrogen availability has been increased through the use of nitrogen based fertilizers. However, application of artificial fertilizers is costly and is limited in developing countries. Moreover, in intensive agricultural systems nitrogen applied to the crops is not used efficiently and is lost as run-off into water courses or as greenhouse gases through denitrification, resulting in deleterious impacts on the environment. The process by which these fertilizers are produced is energy-intensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.  Funds are provided for logistical and follow-up support to conduct an interactive five day workshop titled Nitrogen Ideas Lab (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12579/nsf12579.htm), a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The ultimate aim of this workshop, to be held at Crewe Hall, Cheshire, UK, December 3-7, 2012, is to bring together a trans-disciplinary group of scientists that will spend time together framing the problem, generating novel ideas, developing solutions and action plans \"to develop innovative strategies to increase the efficiency of nitrogen utilization\".  The Nitrogen Ideas Lab will include 30 invited participants, five mentors, five program directors, and facilitators. A unique feature of the workshop is the inclusion of the company Knowinnovation to assist in the design, development, and facilitation of the workshop using a trademark Creative Problem Solving (CPS) methodology. The vision is that mixing researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds will engender fresh thinking and new approaches that can be used to increase nitrogen availability to crop plants while maintaining or increasing yield, and hence decrease the need for the application of nitrogen fertilizers. An expected outcome of the workshop activities will be the formation of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams that will produce transformative research proposals addressing important questions on nitrogen acquisition and nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants. It is envisioned that strong transatlantic synergies will be formed by bringing together highly qualified researchers from the U.S. and the U.K.",
