 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Greater Kansas Area Security Workshop (KanSec) provides a regular forum for researchers and students across Kansas and the neighboring states to present research and educational activities in the field of cybersecurity, and to promote interactions and collaborations. With three NSA/DHS National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) and IA Research (CAE/R) in the State of Kansas, substantial cybersecurity research and educational activities are taking place. KanSec was formed to encourage collaboration despite the geographical remoteness of the area.  The first two KanSec workshops, in Spring and Fall 2012 respectively, included over 50 participants each, with about 10 student presentations at each event. The next workshop is scheduled to be hosted at the University of Kansas in the Spring of 2013, and has received inquiries about participation from universities in neighboring states including Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Arkansas. To improve the quality of the workshop and to give students better experiences, KanSec will invite renowned researchers as keynote speakers for future KanSec workshops.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports student travel to the KanSec workshops in spring and fall 2013.",
