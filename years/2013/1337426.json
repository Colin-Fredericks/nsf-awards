 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Seton Hall University to purchase the bench-top flow cytometer, Miltenyi MACSQuant Analyzer. This instrument will advance bio-related education in two different science departments (the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry) and the Institute of NeuroImmune Pharmacology at Seton Hall University.  This equipment will enhance our teaching collaborations, and will promote multi-disciplinary research, including, but not limited to: cell biology, molecular biology, microbiology, immunology, developmental biology, neuroscience and biochemistry. The flow cytometer enables us to analyze various cell populations in a single sample and assess multiple molecules on the cell surface and/or inside cells simultaneously. It facilitates the analyses of protein, DNA, RNA or small biomolecules concurrently.  This state-of-the-art technology will provide essential information to advance our research, deliver a positive intellectual impact on education, and nurture future scientists.  \r\n\r\nThis instrument will be used in various activities aimed at broader impacts: 1) Hands-on laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students; 2) Training of underrepresented students; 3) Training of women scientists; 4) Training of local high school students and teachers; 5) As part of our community out-reach programs in workshop and scientific events where alumni, parents and visitors will have the opportunity to learn of the versatility of its use. Overall, the flow cytometer will be a great asset for the department, for it will fulfill our mission to train students in scientific principles and technologies preparing them for future professional contributions to society.",
