Higgins\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO); namely a new public address system, completion of the wireless hydraulic remote controls, workboat davit, and noise and sponsoning engineering evaluations. Funding of these items will greatly enhance science support capability and safety on board the vessel.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The LANGSETH supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in the Academic Fleet.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete nearly 185 NSF sponsored days in 2013.",
