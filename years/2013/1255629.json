 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: The overarching research goal of this CAREER project is to explore new physical phenomena that emerge when interfaces between different oxides are created with atomic-scale precision as afforded by the Molecular Beam Epitaxy deposition technique, which enables better control of stoichiometry and termination of the interfaces than other deposition methods. Synthesis, in-situ and ex-situ characterization of heterostructures consisting of perovskite oxides with different valence and multiferroic properties are used to (a) tailor the electronic properties of the interfaces and to investigate the presence of a predicted 2-dimensional electron gas and the metal-insulator-transition at the interfaces; (b) study the epitaxial growth and stabilization of novel oxides; (c) investigate spin injection and the spin transport properties of the established 2-dimensional electron gas at oxide interfaces in magnetic nanostructures using integrated, epitaxially grown oxides as tunnel barriers and spin filters.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: The project involves materials growth and characterization, and explores new interfacial phenomena. The successful implementation of the scientific findings could lay the foundation for a new technology platform based on the interfaces of hybrid materials. It can lead to a large-scale use of oxide technology and has the potential to usher in a new era of highly integrated oxide-based charge and spin electronics. The educational and outreach project activities impact and benefit the society by engaging high-school science teachers in materials science research through a \"hands-on\" summer workshop; attracting the attention of the local, largely Hispanic community and exposing them in scientific research through a  \"Science Open House\" initiative; recruiting and engaging high-school and undergraduate students into research, fostering their understanding of scientific methodology and reasoning; training and retaining the next generation of physicists and materials scientists; leveraging the institutional pool of minority students to increase the level of diversity in scientific disciplines.",

The coupling of the electrons' charge and spin to the lattice and to each other determines the physical properties and can be controlled by strain, chemical doping, or band offsets. SrTiO3-based oxide heterostructures have yielded unexpected physical phenomena, most notably conductivity at the interfaces between insulators.\n\nSrTiO3 is for oxides what Si is for semiconductors not only because they are the most well-studied systems in oxides and semiconductors respectively but because of the tunability of their electronic properties that constitutes them ideal for technological applications. Epitaxial semiconductor and oxide heterostructures are particularly suitable for the realization of quantum devices relying on phase coherent processes because of the advanced growth technology and precision enabling chemically abrupt interfaces and low dimensionality.\n\nIn this CAREER award, we investigated the growth and structure of correlated oxides directly grown on Silicon by oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) as they relate to the quantum electronic properties of the heterostructures. The epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 on Si(001) has been thoroughly studied since 2000. Nevertheless, there have been only a few reports on the magnetotransport of this heterostructure; this is a largely unexplored system in terms of its optoelectronic properties. Given the attention focused on the interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, it merits investigation not only because of the technological relevance of its material constituents, Si and SrTiO3, but also to understand the fundamental physics.\n\nWe investigated the growth, structural, and electronic properties of strained SrTiO3-d films and other perovskite oxides grown epitaxially on Si (001) wafers. The two main thrusts of the performed research were i) growth by oxide-MBE of thin films of SrTiO3 directly on Si (001) and investigation of the interplay between the system's structural and optoelectronics properties and ii) growth by oxide-MBE of BiFe1-xMnxO3 with x up to 0.5.\n\nThe research effort focused on understanding the fundamental aspects of electron transport of low-dimensional oxides on Silicon for the discovery and characterization of quantum phenomena with the goal of creating and enhancing correlated states through direct control over materials growth conditions, doping, and interfacial strain. \n\n We discovered that correlated electron behavior is playing an important role in the electronic properties of the SrTiO3/Si system with Coulomb repulsion, spin-exchange interactions and Zeeman splitting manifesting in the low-temperature magnetotransport measurements. Low carrier concentrations (~1012 cm-2) and epitaxial strain seem to strengthen electron-electron interactions. At higher carrier concentrations (~1014 cm-2), we observed strong spin-orbit interactions with an estimated spin splitting energy ~10 meV in addition to electron-electron interactions.\n\nWe established growth protocols for correlated oxide heterostructures on Si and we used the interface properties and oxide functionalities such as spin-orbit coupling, electron-electron interactions, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity to tailor quantum interactions.\n\nThe research effort was hosted in a Hispanic Serving Institution. This award partially supported the thesis work of a postdoctoral associate, three graduate students who earned their Master's degree and several undergraduate students. The institutional environment provided training to the next generation of scientists and technical experts from diverse backgrounds that can inspire out-of-the box thinking and who will contribute to scientific discoveries. The combined effort of advanced materials growth and characterization efforts enhanced the scientific training of underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields through involving them in basic research and training them in using state-of-the-art instrumentation in addition to involving them in research performed at the National High Magnetic Field Lab.
