 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this capacity building project Fort Berthold Community College (FBCC) is developing the infrastructure to support future Noyce Scholars to serve the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, located in northwestern North Dakota.  The goal is to establish the capacity to produce K-12 STEM teachers who complete a Master of Science in Science Education (MSSE) degree and serve the high-needs reservation schools of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) Nation.  \r\n\r\nThe project integrates an MHA culture context into its activities, and thus potentially transforms the way STEM teachers are prepared to teach Native populations.  Specifically, the project activities include: 1) conducting a needs assessment to increase the pool of MSSE applicants, 2) developing a recruitment plan for future Noyce Scholars serving in high-needs, K-12 reservation schools, 3) conducting research regarding an MHA traditional environmental knowledge and educational pedagogy in K-12 science, 4) creating and pilot testing a culturally rich MHA K-12 science curriculum, 5) expanding the existing FBCC Teacher Education Program to enable individuals with at least a STEM Bachelors degree to meet K-12 teacher licensure requirements in North Dakota, 6) creating a bridge to support graduate level and distance learning challenges for future Noyce Scholars seeking an MSEE, and 7) establishing procedures at Montana State University (MSU) and FBCC to monitor compliance with required coursework completion and teaching commitment required for a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the need for well-prepared STEM teachers at reservation schools. Ten potential Noyce Scholars from the region participate in a four-week internship to pilot test a culturally based, hands-on science curriculum.  Additionally, a collaborative team of stakeholders that includes FBCC and MSU faculty, MHA Elders, and teachers from local school districts (New Town, Parshall, Mandaree, White Shields, and Twin Buttes) are engaged in project activities.",
