 "awd_abstract_narration": "In forensic investigations, the skeletal evidence analysis and facial reconstruction play important roles in identification of the decedent. In current practice, effective skull processing and facial reconstruction are accomplished manually. This project studies 3D geometric analysis and modeling algorithms to automate and augment fragmented/incomplete skull restoration and craniofacial reconstruction and advocates a potential evolution of manual processing to a digital platform for better efficiency, robustness, and objectivity. Two key challenging problems to solve in these forensic tasks are geometric restoration (from small fragmented pieces) and geometric shape synthesis (with complex geometric and semantic constraints). This project studies effective 3D shape matching and transformation techniques to tackle these problems. Geometric restoration is solved through reliable partial matching and symmetry guidance; geometric synthesis is explored via heterogeneous volumetric deformation that enforces given geometric constraints on non-uniform interior layers. \r\n\r\nThe new geometric algorithms can benefit incomplete data modeling and analysis in many computer graphics and vision tasks. In this project, computer scientists are collaborating with forensic specialists to build a digital computational platform and evaluate the application of these new geometric algorithms in forensic skull processing and craniofacial reconstruction. This project facilitates incomplete data analysis and reconstruction in forensic law enforcement, archaeology, biological anthropology, and craniofacial orthopedics. The research and education are integrated by taking research advances into existing and future courses, involving RET/REU/K-12 students in geometric modeling research and graphics/visualization system development; and attracting K-12 and under-representative students into STEM education.",

However, in real cases, the restoration of the skeletal remains and the reconstruction of the face still need to be processed manually by forensic specialists. This procedure could take up to several days to finish, which is very time consuming and labor intensive.&nbsp;Also, reconstructions done by different persons could be different because of their subjectivity. This project aims to develop a first digital automatic pipeline to make this procedure more efficient and more objective.</p>\n<p>The skull restoration and facial reconstruction pipeline has three main components: fragmented skull reassembly, damage restoration, and facial reconstruction.</p>\n<p>The first step, fragmented skull reassembly, can be formulated as teaching computers to solve arbitrarily cut 3D jigsaw puzzles. Although this was formulated as a classic AI and vision problem for more than three decades, most existing algorithms only work on toy examples and couldn?t even handle moderately complex puzzles. The key challenges toward solving this problem are due to the lack of (1) reliably identifying then aligning neighboring pieces, and (2) effective global searching algorithm that can prune matching outliers and extract mutually coherent correspondences from massive unreliable correlations. We have developed a set of novel feature modeling, data matching, and global searching algorithms, that significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms in reassembling complex 2D image and 3D geometry puzzles.</p>\n<p>The second step, damage restoration, can be formulated as training computers to guess the geometry of a missing region on an incomplete object. Widely adopted geometric repair algorithms suitable for skull completion include using smoothness, using self-symmetry, and using transplantation from a similar template model. However, these methods all have their reliability and accuracy issues. Although the recent deep learning approaches have achieved great performance in many image completion tasks, they need to be built on huge volume of training data. But there are cases, like our problem, that such big amount of data is unavailable. We have developed a geometric completion algorithm by building a statistical shape model on a latent subspace. With limited training datasets, our algorithm can produce much better skull completion results than other existing algorithms.</p>\n<p>The last step is to reconstruct the face from the repaired skull. Direct facial reconstruction from skull suffers from reconstruction ambiguity. We have developed a new strategy based on superimposition: first match the skull with many faces in database, then further revise the best matched face until it fully follows the skull. We built a new deep 3D face auto-encoder and produced more accurate face reconstruction results than existing reconstruction algorithms. We also built a first geometry-guided GAN for face inpainting to locally refine reconstructed face according to the skull. The face reconstructed from the given skull now preserves desirable features and very good accuracy, which was not achieved by any previous algorithm.</p>\n<p>Besides their applications in forensics, the developed new matching, restoration, completion, and reconstruction algorithms have broad applications in bio-medicine, robotics, virtual reality content modeling, and computer-aided engineering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xin&nbsp;Li</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017552846_1.Reassembly--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017552846_1.Reassembly--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fragment Reassembly\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017552846_1.Reassembly--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fragment Reassembly\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Automatic reassembly of 2D (image) or 3D (geometric object) fragments.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xin Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xin&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fragment Reassembly</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017760171_2.DamageCompletion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017760171_2.DamageCompletion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Damage Completion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541017760171_2.DamageCompletion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Damage Completion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Completion of damaged/missing regions on a skull by integrating self-symmetry, similar skull template, and statistical shape models.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xin Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xin&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Damage Completion</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021379514_6.EnvironmentMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021379514_6.EnvironmentMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sets\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021379514_6.EnvironmentMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sets\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An application of our developed matching and reassembly algorithm on computer vision and robotic SLAM: 3D reconstruction from sparse image sets with small overlap.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xin Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xin&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sets</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021744651_ResultValidation_NoPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021744651_ResultValidation_NoPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reconstruction Result Validation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320959/1320959_10264540_1541021744651_ResultValidation_NoPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reconstruction Result Validation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Validating Facial Reconstruction Results.
