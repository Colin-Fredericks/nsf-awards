 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication between neurons in the brain occurs via synaptic transmission at chemical synapses, and tightly regulated release of neurotransmitter from activated to target neurons is required.  Since the fundamental molecular mechanisms of transmitter release are conserved throughout evolution, molecular-genetic studies in fruit flies can be used to discover the mechanisms regulating release without the expense or ethical considerations of mammalian studies.  Using molecular techniques to generate mutant transgenic Drosophila, Dr. Reist and colleagues will determine how the neuronal calcium-binding protein, synaptotagmin, regulates multiple types of neurotransmitter release:  calcium-triggered synchronous and asynchronous release as well as spontaneous release.  Actively adjusting the amount of transmitter released and the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous release are thought to be a key mechanisms mediating learning and memory.  Thus, this work will provide critical mechanistic insights required for understanding how synaptic transmission is regulated in animals.  \r\n\r\nThese studies will contribute to a foundational and mechanistic basis for future translational studies aimed at improving neuronal communication in diseases of neural dysfunction, such as Alzheimer?s disease. All transgenic fly lines generated in this work will be made freely available to the scientific community; when accepted, lines will be sent to the Bloomington Stock Center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/).  Other lines will be available via e-mail request.  Dr. Reist has trained numerous female (and male) undergraduate and graduate students in molecular neuroscience, and the implementation of this project will provide continued training opportunities for U.S. students.  In addition, Dr. Reist regularly participates in the International Brain Research Organization's visiting lecture team program (http://ibro.info/professional-development/vltp-courses/).  She has taught students in China, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka about the molecular mechanisms of transmitter release.  As such, these studies will directly contribute to educational outreach in developing nations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: \n\nCommunication between neurons in the brain requires efficient calcium-triggered release of neurotransmitter from active neurons.  Since the mechanisms of transmitter release have been highly conserved throughout evolution, molecular-genetic studies in fruit flies can reveal how mammalian neurons communicate without the expense or ethical considerations of mammalian studies.  Neurotransmitter release occurs in three phases: 1) fast, synchronous release, 2) slower asynchronous release, and 3) spontaneous (non-triggered) release.  This NSF project examined the role of the neuronal calcium-binding protein, synaptotagmin, during each phase of neurotransmitter release.  Using molecular techniques to generate mutant transgenic Drosophila, Dr. Reist and colleagues determined: 1) the mechanisms by which synaptotagmin-membrane interactions mediate efficient fast, synchronous transmitter release; 2) that the leading hypothesis of synaptotagmin regulation of asynchronous release was incorrect and the mechanism whereby previous synaptotagmin mutants were functioning as asynchronous calcium sensors; and 3) the impact of the electrostatic charge of synaptotagmin on regulating spontaneous release.  Since adjusting the amount of transmitter released is thought to be a key mechanism mediating learning and memory, this work elucidating the basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission should promote translational studies aimed at improving neuronal communication in cases of neuronal dysfunction.  Indeed, a continuing international collaboration under this grant determed the basic molecular mechanism underlying the symptoms of a congenital myasthenic syndrome caused by a mutation in synaptotagmin.  \n\n \n\nBroader impacts: \n\nDuring the course of this project more than ten transgenic fly lines were generated.  These will be made freely available to the scientific community promptly after publication of our findings. \n\nThis project provided training for two female high school students, ten undergraduate (8 female, 1 minority), three graduate (2 female), and five graduate rotation (3 female, 1 minority) students in the United States. \n\nWhile supported by this grant, Dr. Reist participated in the International Brain Research Organization\u2019s visiting lecture team program (http://ibro.info/professional-development/vltp-courses/).
