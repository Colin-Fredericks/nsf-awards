Recently, researchers at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed an Error Modeling framework (EMv2) for AADL that enables modeling of different types of faults, fault behavior of individual system components, modeling of fault propagation affecting related components, as well as specification of fault tolerance strategies expected in the system architectures. In this proposal the PIs will demonstrate how AADL EMv2 can provide semi-automated support of safety / risk analysis activities that can be used in regulatory submissions for ICE apps and devices. They will (a) define libraries of common errors / faults relevant to MDCF apps and devices, (b) illustrate how information needed to drive common risk analysis techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis, Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis, and Functional Hazard Analysis can be formalized in terms of AADL architecture annotated with Error Model information, (c) illustrate the benefits of formal interface specifications of device behavior and conditions under which errors may arise, be propagated, and be mitigated and (d) develop recommendations for how the artifacts resulting from these activities might be presented as part of regulatory submissions for ICE components.",
