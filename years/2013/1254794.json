 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth IMACS International Conference on Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory will be held at the \r\nUniversity of Georgia from March 25 to March 28, 2013. More information is available on the conference website: waves.uga.edu\r\n\r\nThe proposed conference will focus on the derivation, theory, numerical simulation and application of nonlinear wave equations. Despite several decades of intense activity, this general area shows no sign of abating nor of calcification. Indeed, two of the recent Fields medalists are cited for their work in this area, and major new forays into geophysical modeling and high-speed communication have made use of nonlinear wave equations. The conferences in this series are well known for bringing together researchers in theoretical and computational mathematics, the applied sciences and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature  several invited, one-hour presentations on some of the most topical aspects of the area and an estimated 180 shorter talks, most of which will be in a focused session format. Past experience suggests that well over 200 participants will attend. At the most recent conference in 2011, 229 research papers were presented. In addition to 161 participants from the USA, there were 68 international scientists and students from 36 countries. We had 41 graduate and undergraduate students, 3 junior faculty and 27 women who attended the conference. This conference we will have 20 organized sessions, 3 keynote speakers, and two tutorials for students and young faculty. The requested support is for the expenses of the invited speakers and to defray the costs of younger participants, with special attention paid to students, women, minorities, persons with disabilities, postdocs and junior faculty. As of mid-November, 2012, more than 50 applications were received from students, women, underrepresented groups, and young faculty requesting financial support to attend the conference.",
