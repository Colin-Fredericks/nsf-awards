 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition from ombrotrophic bogs to minerotrophic fens increases methylation rates and alters methylation pathways from those associated with microbial syntrophy and fermentation to those driven by anaerobic respiration, e.g., sulfate and iron reduction, in minerotrophic fens. This hypothesis is based on PIs? observations of (1) altered anaerobic decomposition pathways with the transition from bogs to fens in Alaskan wetlands, (2) dominance of syntrophic bacteria in an ombrotrophic bog, and (3) enhanced methylation by syntrophic microbial interactions. The hypothesis will be tested using a combination of field surveys and laboratory incubations that encompass chemical, biogeochemical and molecular analyses of wetlands representing trophic gradients in Alaska. The educational and outreach activities include: (1) production and dissemination of videos about the project and climate change; (2) the mentoring of students and a postdoctoral fellow; (3) hands-on field and laboratory experiences for high school students and teachers near PIs? institutions, and (4) high quality education of undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions through hands-on research and integration into classroom curricula, including student research funded by this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Arctic region is a geographic area where toxic mercury has accumulated for billions of years, largely sequestered in the thick layer of soil just below the surface that remains constantly frozen (aka permafrost).  Mercury in permafrost is quite stable and presents very little health risk to the public. However, accelerated rates of permafrost thawing due to climate change promotes microbial activity and the release of mercury, thereby increasing its bioavailability to organisms and food chains of local ecosystems. Of most concern to public health is the transformation of mercury to methylmercury, a potent neuromuscular toxin which readily accumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic and terrestrial food chains.  Methylmercury is formed by microorganisms that live in environments devoid of oxygen such as Arctic wetlands that are created during permafrost thawing.  The goal of our project was to determine how wetland development as permafrost thaws affects the accumulation of methylmercury in the Arctic region.\n\nIn our research, we identified wetlands in two regions of central Alaska, one near Fairbanks and the other near Anchorage, that were in various stages of development, from nutrient-poor marshy fens to highly developed muddy bogs.  We sampled these wetlands every summer for three consecutive years.  For each wetland, we measured the concentrations of mercury and methylmercury, and identified the microorganisms that live in these wetlands and their potential to convert mercury to methylmercury, and numerous other parameters that are important to microbial activity and mercury bioavailability.  Our results clearly show that as wetlands develop they accumulate more methylmercury with a higher potential for the formation of this neurotoxin by more diverse microorganisms.  These results show that warming-induced wetland development may lead to enhanced rate of methylmercury formation and increased risk to public and environmental health.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew A Nugent"
