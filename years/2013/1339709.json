 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI meeting will showcase the NSF Expeditions in Computing program and provide an opportunity for Expeditions PIs and program directors to interact with each other, the NSF, and industry guests. The meeting will last three days and include an overview of existing Expeditions projects, panels on topics of large project management, outreach, and opportunities in additional NSF programs.  The schedule will include ample time for one-on-one interactions including a poster session on the final day. In addition, the meeting will coincide with the CISE advisory board meeting to give the board members a chance to learn more about CISE's flagship program, interact with the research teams, and provide feedback and suggestions to the showcased research projects or the expedition program in general.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis meeting will highlight the three goals of the Expeditions program: to catalyze far-reaching research explorations motivated by deep scientific questions or hard problems in the computing and information fields, and/or by compelling applications that promise significant societal benefits; to inspire current and future generations of Americans, especially those from under-represented groups, to pursue rewarding careers in computer and information science and engineering; and to stimulate significant research and education outcomes that, through effective knowledge transfer mechanisms, promise scientific, economic and/or other societal benefits.  This is the first Expeditions PI meeting and will also serve to provide direct feedback to the NSF on the success of the Expeditions program as well as suggestions for the future of the program. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe meeting will provide opportunity for researchers from disparate disciplines to interact and learn new models for conducting and managing large basic research projects.  The meeting will also serve as a venue for connecting with potential industry partners for technology transition. One key aspect of the discussions will be an overview of each team's outreach activities and the benefits and challenges of large, coordinated outreach and education efforts compared to individual efforts. In addition, teams will be encouraged to bring students to the meeting to participate in presentations and discussions.",
