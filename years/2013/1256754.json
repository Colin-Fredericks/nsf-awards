 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon and nitrogen in soil, and the microorganisms that both form and degrade it, constitute a critically important natural resource. Soil organisms likely harbor the greatest biodiversity on this globe and by their decomposition activities maintain the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this OPUS project, hundreds of papers will be digitized for further analysis and placed on the internet for international usage. Breakthroughs in instrumentation and molecular biology are providing new ways to interpret the extensive historical data.  Analyses of all these data will lead to new interpretations on the age, chemical characteristics of soil organic matter and identities and activities of soil microorganisms.  The information will be used to produce a series of syntheses to help scientists better predict and mediate interactions between this important resource and other aspects of global change. \r\n \r\nSoil organic matter and soil organisms form the base of the world's food and fiber production, and are equally important in rangelands as they are in forests. Improved biogeochemical models will help predict future changes and will influence management decisions.  The information gained will be especially useful to scientists, and will also be presented in formats such that news media can use to inform the general public.  Knowledge derived from this synthesis will be incorporated into the next generation of university textbooks, as well as public school curricula.",
