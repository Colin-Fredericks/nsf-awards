The symposium will highlight significant recent scientific and educational developments in mathematical biology, ecology, and biostatistics.  This conference will bring together junior researchers from both the biological and the mathematical sciences to disseminate their current work and to network with other junior and senior researchers and educators whose combined expertise covers many areas in mathematical biology. \r\n\r\nAn important component of the meeting is to broaden the education and stimulate the research of young and underrepresented participants. Results from the conference will address environmental and public health problems and questions. In addition, results from this conference will help in the establishment of a biomathematical curriculum that is current and relevant to society.",
