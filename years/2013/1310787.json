 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Julia M. Moriarty of Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the College of William & Mary to conduct a research project in the Geosciences area during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan.  The project title is \"The Influence of Typhoons on Along-River Sediment Fluxes.\" The host scientist is Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding changes in the transport of riverine material is crucial for estimating sediment budgets, but particulate fluxes vary widely in response to storms and other disturbances.  Taiwan offers a unique opportunity to study these fluxes because of the exceptional historical and ongoing records of river discharge (water and sediment) along its small mountainous rivers, and because the island's sediment yields (riverine sediment discharge divided by watershed area) rank among the world's highest.  Analysis of the historical record of daily and hourly river gauge data enables analysis of along-river fluxes during both low-energy periods and typhoons (e.g. 1996: Typhoon Herb; 2004: Typhoons Mindulle and Aere).  This project will make measurements along the Jhuoshuei River (previously named the Choshui River) in 2013, including sediment concentration and grain size, in order to supplement the historical data.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the research is being incorporated into an interactive activity to engage visitors at Marine Science Day, an annual open house at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) where attendance annually exceeds 1,500 people.  This activity is also being developed into a grade-school lesson plan in collaboration with VIMS Marine Advisory Program educators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVariations in Along-River Sediment Fluxes: Influence of Typhoons\n\n \n\nThis East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) grant funded Julia M. Moriarty of Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), the College of William &amp; Mary to work with Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan during the summer of 2013. \n\n \n\nUnderstanding changes in the riverine sedimentary signature is crucial for estimating sediment budgets, which affect ecosystem health and water quality, the stability of coastal structures, and the geologic record.  Sediment fluxes vary temporally as storms and other disturbances occur, and spatially as sediment erosion, transport and deposition vary along the river-ocean continuum, and so variations in fluxes remain unquantified in many rivers.  Taiwan offers a unique opportunity to study these fluxes because of the exceptional historical and ongoing records of river discharge (water and sediment) along its small mountainous rivers, and because the island\u00c6s sediment yields (sediment discharge divided by watershed area) rank among the world\u00c6s highest. \n\n \n\nThis study was broken into two parts: a historical study and a modern process study.  In both parts, daily and hourly measurements along the Jhuoshuei River, Taiwan, were used to calculate suspended sediment fluxes at 2 to 5 stations along the length of the river.  The Jhuoshuei River (previously named the Choshui River) was chosen because it is well-monitored, and drains the second-largest watershed of any Taiwanese river.  \n\n \n\nPreviously-collected data enabled analysis of along-river water, sediment and carbon fluxes during low-energy periods and Typhoons Mindulle and Aere in 2004.  During Typhoon Mindulle, for example, total suspended matter (TSM) increased, the particulate organic carbon (POC) content typically decreased, and isotopic signatures (&delta;13C, &delta;15N) remained relatively constant at all stations.  However, across- and along- river variability created significant uncertainties in sediment discharge estimates.  Sediment concentrations peaked over a day before peak discharge, indicating that within the timescale of a single flood, the river at least partially depleted local supplies of fine, easily-suspendable material, consistent with changes to rating curve coefficients. To supplement the historical data, measurements including sediment concentration, grain size, and POC content were made in 2013 along the Jhuoshuei River during low-energy conditions and a moderate rainfall event during Typhoon Udor.  Analyses of these data are ongoing. \n\n \n\nBroader impacts of this EAPSI fellowship include providing the fellow with a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Taiwan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.
