 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop an integrated research and educational collaboration to examine the fundamental behavior of large arrays of coupled nonlinear oscillators.  Through a combined series of theoretical and experimental investigations, we will investigate how alterations in the coupling (via magnetic interactions)  can tailor bandgaps, bifurcations, the localization of energy, and a new phenomena called a passively reconfiguring bandgap.  Research studies build from theory to micro/macro experimental demonstrations with a focus on tuning the magnetic interactions to create desired phenomena.  The Principle Investigators believe the passively reconfiguring bandgaps, where a response threshold could be used to completely reconfigure the bandgap structure, offers a fundamentally new capability for avoiding catastrophic failures. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental nature of the research investigations is expected to improve engineering practice with specific examples of how to exploit nonlinearity to achieve  desirable energy flow behaviors in oscillator arrays.  The avoidance of catastrophic failures from mechanical or acoustic overloads is a specific application area for this research. Educational and outreach efforts will leverage the PIs successful involvement in existing programs, the Pratt Fellows program at Duke University and the NSF funded Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (SEAGEP) program at the University of Florida, to attract underrepresented students to participate in engineering research and pursue advanced degrees.  Summertime graduate student exchanges are planned to broaden the perspectives of everyone involved and enhance the project collaboration and impact.",
