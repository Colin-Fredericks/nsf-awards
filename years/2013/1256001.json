 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nAn award is made to the University of Michigan to develop a novel label-free spectral optical technique and instrument for advanced histopathologic examination of tissue and cellular samples. This program will develop a new roadmap technology for wide band and highly sensitive ultrasound detection. The project will explore an all-optical photoacoustic microscopy technology for high resolution 3D imaging by using the broadband detector platform. The high sensitivity of the detector will allow probing of thick tissues. This research opens the gate for the first time to research the mechanism of living cells and their activities with virus or ambient microenvironment based on absorption contrast and will induce new series of molecular probes based on optical absorption. The new instrument will provide the unique optical contrast, offering the prospect of comprehensive examination and diagnosis of live cells and tissues, which could have a transformative impact to functional microscopy and biomedical imaging.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nTechnologies that can provide significantly improved contrast and resolution are in high demand for biomedical imaging applications. Comparing with the conventional histologic methods, the technology to be developed in this program provides a revolutionary new tool that allows reproducible and objective diagnosis of unstained tissues and cells, facilitating improved disease diagnosis and automatic screening, as well as cutting-edge research that can only be conducted on live tissues or cells. It will free the researchers and medical staff of laborious sample preparation involving fixation, sectioning and staining. The impact of such an instrument will be similar to how the confocal microscopy revolutionized the conventional optical microscopy by providing the fine resolution sectioning capability. \r\n\r\nThis program will be enhanced by the integration of the education and outreach component which includes the creation of a multidisciplinary (optical science, microfabrication, biomedical imaging) scientific learning environment for students at a variety of levels (from K12 to graduate) and from several underrepresented groups (women, African-Americans, and Latinos); and incorporation of research results into courses on photonic devices and nanofabrication. The program will help to increase the scientific literacy of the public by outreach activities.",
