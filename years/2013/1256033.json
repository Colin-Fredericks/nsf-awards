The project will (1) develop new tools for online biodiversity data management; (2) solidify a broad international team through online collaboration, international field-collecting expeditions, and training of students and young researchers; (3) estimate the phylogenetic placement of ~1,360 species based on DNA sequences; (4) assemble a database of morphological, climatic, and biogeographic data; and (5) publish a revision of the higher level taxonomy of Carex.\r\n\r\nThe taxonomy of global plant and animal groups provides information essential to species and habitat conservation, ecological restoration, and our understanding of biodiversity. This project will produce a phylogenetic framework for one of the largest flowering plant genera, providing an essential tool for understanding global plant biodiversity. At the same time, this project (1) trains the next generation of sedge taxonomists; (2) increases taxonomic readiness in students and teachers; (3) publishes diverse datasets online through eMonocot and Encyclopedia of Life; and (4) contributes to global biodiversity conservation through an enhanced barcoding resource and new informatic tools.",
