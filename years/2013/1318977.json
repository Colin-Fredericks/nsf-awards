 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education EXP project, reserachers are addressing how and for what purposes Augmented Reality (AR) technologies can be used to support learning of critical inquiry strategies and processes; the question is being explored in the context of history education and the SCIM-C (Summarizing, Contextualizing, Inferring, Monitoring, and Corroborating) framework developed for inquiry history education.  A combined hardware/software platform is being designed and developed to support SCIM-C pedagogy. Students use a mobile device with augmented reality to augment their \"field\" experience at a local historical site. In addition to experiencing the site as it exists, AR technology is being built to allow them to view and experience the site from several social perspectives and to view its structure and uses over several time periods. Students also use the mobile device to collect, annotate, and organize data at the local site, and the apps organize that data according to where it is collected at the site. Additional desktop and laptop software supports exploration, manipulation, and analysis of the data and writing and discussion in support of telling the site's story. Research focuses on the design of AR applications and associated technologies to support inquiry based in field work for the variety of disciplines where analysis of change over time is important (e.g., historical-cultural studies, geosciences, eco-sciences) and on understanding how to use the perspectives augmented reality can provide to promote inquiry processes and to promote understanding of how very small changes over long periods of time may add up to very large changes.\r\n\r\nLearning how to think critically, analyze sources, and develop an evidence-based account is central to a variety of disciplines. However, learners struggle to grasp the importance of such inquiry processes, to understand how experts engage in inquiry, and to master the strategies needed to practice such inquiry themselves. The purpose of this project is to explore how augmented reality (AR) technology can be used to give learners concrete experiences of life during several historical periods and support their reasoning as they make sense of the story of the place and what influenced its history. The researchers posit that the same types of concrete experiences with the past and the same types of help with making sense of changes over time are necessary to understand many sciences as well, and they expect that what is learned about making the historical past concrete enough for high schoolers to grasp will also be applicable to making the history of the natural world concrete enough for high schoolers to support their understanding of such concepts as geologic time, geologic processes, and evolutionary processes.",

Guided by the &ldquo;How Students Learn&rdquo; framework and the existing literature on learning that clearly identifies &ldquo;pathways toward academic development,&rdquo; we use mobile AR technology to demonstrate how history students as young as fifth graders can learn the process of historical inquiry by analyzing evidence within an augmented real-world setting.</p>\n<p>The overarching question that guided our project was how and to what extent AR technologies can be used to support learning of critical inquiry strategies and processes. We explored how AR can (1) support students as they develop a deeper understanding of the concept of time, continuity and change, and (2) provide an explicit hard scaffold and layered strategy instruction to teach historical inquiry.</p>\n<p>Considering the problems of contextualization, cognitive overloading, and disengagement with traditional inquiry alongside AR&rsquo;s abilities to support contextualization and engagement, we developed an &ldquo;ambitious teaching&rdquo; case using AR. Our learning goals for inquiry learning indicated that students should be able to: (1) Engage with sources, ask deep questions, reflect on the meaning of sources, connect sources to one another, and develop an evidence based account of the past, (2) Develop an understanding of how a local historic site fits within the larger national historical context, (3) Understand time, continuity, and change at the site, and (4) Use historical thinking to cultivate a sense of perspective/empathy about local and national history.</p>\n<p>In our field trials we used the Christiansburg Institute (CI), a historic former African-American segregated school that existed until 1966, as our exploratory test bed.&nbsp;The legacy and significance of the CI campus in terms of racial segregation made it an ideal case study for teaching local history as a gateway to regional and national history. Over the years, the CI site has changed significantly; only three acres out of 180 remain, and only two buildings&ndash;the Edgar A. Long building (on the historic register but inaccessible) and the Scattergood Gym (currently sub-divided into a church and local business) remain of the original 13 (Figure 1). While the campus itself is no longer visible, just as important is the fact that the history of CI itself has also become invisible to many in the local community. The space represents the hidden history of racial segregation. Our unit of instruction invites students to investigate a history mystery on CI using an AR-enhanced paper map and includes a field trip to CI to explore evidence using AR, including virtual X-ray vision (Figure 2). The compelling question for the unit that students explore on-site is: &ldquo;If this site could talk, what would it tell us about the people here 50 years ago?&rdquo; Upon beginning the mystery, the majority of students have no prior knowledge that this site was formerly an African American School of any historic importance.</p>\n<p>In their investigation, students used CI Spy to analyze evidence while using the inquiry strategy. CI Spy is a mobile handheld AR application that provides access to the CI site by presenting virtual representations of building and evidence in the context of the site (Figure 3). Students can go inside and physically examine historical sources in &ldquo;real&rdquo; but inaccessible buildings or in virtual 3D models of buildings that no longer exist (see Figure 4). The sources of evidence (photos, oral histories, and documents) were virtually arranged inside the buildings based on context and relevance.</p>\n<p>Our work makes significant contributions to the field of learning technologies by successfully applying AR to the novel area of inquiry learning in history. This research enables deeper understanding of historical inquiry for younger students by combining AR experiences with strategic learning along with a framework to support in-field inquiry. Our work contributes not only a novel application category for mobile AR, but also guidance for a number of technical, logistical, and design issues based on our experience designing and evaluating&nbsp;CI-Spy.</p>\n<p>The research makes an important contribution to the study of interactive technologies for interpreting heritage sites by testing how augmented and virtual sites can be used for teaching not only history but the <em>skills of historical interpretation</em> to public history site visitors. Public History theorists have long studied the impact that visiting an intact or renovated historic site has on visitor's ability to connect with the relevant history; this application positions visitors to experience this effect within sites that are no longer or are only partially extent. What is innovative here and will contribute to public history studies, however, is the ability to \"go inside\" and interact act with inaccessible structures and the additional on-site augmented experience of exploring historic sources and building a narrative, allowing visitors to become more than consumers of history but practitioners themselves.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ogle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480455133162_ci1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480455133162_ci1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: A Virtual Building at CI.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480455133162_ci1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: A Virtual Building at CI.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A 3D model of a former building on the CI campus as seen through the outdoor AR app.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ogle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4: A Virtual Building at CI.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480454850792_ci2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480454850792_ci2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: X-ray View\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1318977/1318977_10274420_1480454850792_ci2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: X-ray View\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A student peers \"inside\" the boarded up Long Building to engage with evidence of the school's past.
