 "awd_abstract_narration": "All animal and plant populations can weather change.  However, the amount of environmental change a population can absorb is likely to depend upon other, past and ongoing stresses that the population experiences. This project will test whether the ability of populations of native plants and animals in coastal marshes to withstand the recent, extreme storm Hurricane Sandy was greater or less in marshes more subject to past stresses. Researchers will compare the abundances of marsh plants and animals before and after the storm and test whether vulnerability was greater in more specialized species or in marshes surrounded by development, invaded by introduced plants, or challenged by high rates of sea-level rise, and whether previous protection of areas from different kinds of development or use helped reduce vulnerability. By addressing these questions using current theories of ecosystem disturbance, the research will provide general insights on the effects of disturbance and stress on native species and habitats.\r\n \r\nThis research also will provide a specific assessment of Hurricane Sandy?s impact on tidal marshes, a vital buffer against storm damage. This will help managers target specific marshes for conservation and restoration and improve the efficiency of planned federal restoration efforts.  The work will also inform future coastal management planning by identifying which types of marshes are most vulnerable to future disturbances. Findings will be disseminated to local, state, and federal partners through the Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program, a cooperative consortium of universities, non-governmental organizations, and state and Federal agency partners working together to conserve tidal marsh habitats and the species they support (www.tidalmarshbirds.org).  The project will also help train 20 field technicians.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMajor storms, like Hurricane Sandy, often have devastating effects on human infrastructure.  Our understanding of their effects on natural systems, however, is limited because we generally cannot predict storms well enough to collect the detailed pre-storm data required to describe ecological effects in full.  In 2011-12, we collected data from over 1500 locations along a more than 1400-km stretch of the US Atlantic Coast, to quantify tidal marsh bird populations and the habitat that they used.  This NSF RAPID grant enabled us to revisit those sites to document short-term ecological responses to Hurricane Sandy.  Despite having a statistically powerful data set, we found no evidence for systematic ecological change as a result of the storm.  Moreover, we found no evidence that storm effects were greater in areas subject to other human stressors, such as habitat fragmentation, urbanization, and sea-level rise.  We did, however, find that vegetation change was greater in areas with high rates of sea-level rise, irrespective of any storm effect, with a shift towards species generally found in wetter conditions.
