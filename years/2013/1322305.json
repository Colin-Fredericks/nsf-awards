 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivating vision behind \"computational and data-enabled science and engineering\" (CDS&E) is that the development, implementation, adoption, use and diffusion of advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) will revolutionize research and education in the U.S., enhancing the nation's economic competitiveness and maintaining the nation's leadership in science and engineering discovery. However, the implementation and diffusion of CI-enabled science -- and especially the adoption of advanced CDS&E tools -- is not well understood.  These next-generation technologies are dynamic to an unprecedented degree, in that they are user-driven, custom-made, produced on demand, and \"permanently beta.\"  Most importantly, they are being put to use while simultaneously being developed; and all this is occurring within CI-enabled virtual organizations (VOs), which constantly evolve along with the technologies.  \r\n\r\nThis project examines the rise and fall of new computational tools within CI-enabled, virtually-organized science and engineering research.  The project employs a grounded-theory approach, to analyze interview data about the emergence of advanced CDS&E tools, and to construct a theoretical framework for understanding dynamic innovation development, use, adoption, implementation, and diffusion within CDS&E VOs. The project's empirical focus will be the NSF-funded Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE; https://www.xsede.org/), a nationwide network of distributed high-performance computing resources.  Snowball recruitment will be used to identify domain scientists, computational technologists, and supercomputer center administrators (across e-science projects, institutions, and disciplines) who have experience with adopting, developing, and using computational tools within the XSEDE ecosystem.  Interviews will seek to illuminate best practices and common pitfalls in the emergence of advanced computational tools and in the deployment of such tools by practicing CDS&E researchers.\r\n\r\nFindings from this work will help NSF and other federal agencies to optimize existing and future CI investments.  The research may also have implications for commercial and open-source technologies that share some of the dynamic, distributed feedback and network properties of advanced scientific CI -- promising insights that could enhance the development and diffusion of such technologies well beyond the academic science community.",

This project also examined the social and organizational aspects of technical innovations and endeavors in the cyberinfrastructure community. Out of this project, the PI (a faculty member in the School of Communication) and his student research team at Chapman University (a traditional liberal arts university located at Orange, California) found that user feedback is the key driving communication mechanism that links technology development and use in tight cycles, which lead to adaptive cyberinfrastructure tools useful for large-scale science and engineering research with big data. More specifically, frequent user feedback helps developers in big data projects understand users? needs, makes tools user-friendly, prevents emergencies, and is better for developers than no feedback. Furthermore, good feedback is often structured, specific, actionable, timely, generalizable, and delivered in an interpersonally tactful way.</p>\n<p>The research team also found that synergistic relationship building, strategic organizational design, and transparent information sharing are key to optimizing the tool development processes, especially in dispersed teams and virtual organizations behind big cyberinfrastructure projects. These processes can yield cyberinfrastructure tools that are more likely to be adopted by users in the scientific community. Successful tools for adoption tend to have the following attributes: driven by needs, organized access, trialability, observability, relative advantage, simplicity, compatibility, community-driven, well-documented, and adaptability. In addition to tool attributes, project teams behind successfully adopted cyberinfrastructure tend to share these following social/organizational attributes: multidisciplinary expertise, shared goals, common language, bridging liaisons, productive routines, face-to-face meetings, altruistic leadership, clear roles, effective user feedback, sustainable funding, organizational capacity, and personnel continuity. These findings not only apply to cyberinfrastructure innovations, but potentially more broadly to a larger range of computational and big data related innovations, including emerging technologies in the general entrepreneurial startup community.</p>\n<p>The PI and research team derived these findings from a total of 115 in-depth interviews with 110 stakeholders across 27 US states and 2 European countries between 2013 and 2018. Based on systematic analyses of the interview transcripts, the PI and research team produced a journal article, 2 book chapters, 3 conference proceeding publications, and a peer-reviewed conference poster. More publications will be produced in the near future as research writing is ongoing. Furthermore, 22 research posters were produced and presented at an in-house student research fair by undergraduate students in communication studies, strategic &amp; corporate communication, psychology, business administration, economics, and Spanish. These undergraduate students also represented minors such as economics, sociology, history, public relations, social entrepreneurship, environmental studies, English, and Spanish.

Additionally, this NSF project attracted 2 other undergraduate students (with previous experience working with the PI on other research projects) and 2 new graduate students to work on the NSF project during their master?s education at Chapman University. Among the 6 undergraduates who went on to get their master?s degrees, 1 of them (about 17%) is in a PhD program.
