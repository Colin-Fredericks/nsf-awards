 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Veronica Vaida and Rex T. Skodje both at the University Colorado at Boulder in a collaborative experimental/theoretical effort by their groups that is focused on the study the photochemical reactions of organic molecules occurring at air/water interfaces and in small hydrated clusters in the gas phase. These photochemical reactions can play an important role in the formation and chemical evolution of atmospheric aerosols with potential important consequences to human health and climate change.  The intellectual merit in the proposed investigation stems from addressing the basic scientific aspects of sunlight-initiated, water-mediated chemistry of organic molecules. Using a combination of laboratory and theoretical studies, the outcome of the work will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms, dynamics, and rates of photochemical reactions occurring in clusters and on aerosol surfaces that are of importance in the atmosphere. What distinguishes this work from other efforts is the emphasis on deriving molecular-level mechanisms and quantitative models for atmospheric photochemistry in aqueous environments. It is anticipated that greater understanding of the fundamental chemistry involved in the photochemistry occurring in aerosols and more general aqueous environments. An important part of the proposed work is the direct observation of the photochemistry of air/water/organic gas phase mixtures using the French CESAM instrument (Experimental Multiphasic Atmospheric Simulation Chamber). Experiments conducted in this chamber permit the direct observation of aerosol formation and the chemical evolution of the mixture under the influence of intense UV/visible radiation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, improving the ability to model atmospheric processes involved in climate change is an important goal for society and can impact public policy. The treatment of aerosols in current models is a \"weak link\" and requires significant attention.  The proposed study of photochemical mechanisms involved in aerosol nucleation and chemical evolution has the potential to provide improved performance of these models by incorporating a more correct treatment of the chemistry of secondary organic aerosols. In addition, the interdisciplinary, international collaborations proposed will lead to the exchange of students and postdoctoral fellows, and promote cross-fertilization of ideas between different institutions in the basic science of atmospheric photochemistry. The proposed research program contributes to the recruitment, retention and educational development of graduate and undergraduate students, especially from under-represented groups, by exposure to a collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research funded by the National Science Foundation through project 1306386 investigated how sunlight can induce essential chemical transformations involving organic molecules that exist in the Earth?s atmosphere.  These chemical reactions are initiated by solar photons and can occur in the gas phase or in aqueous environments, such as provided by water droplets in the atmosphere.   The work consisted of both experimental and theoretical aspects. We have investigated fundamental photochemical processes occurring in gas and solution phases and also in organic films lying at the air-water interface.\n\n \n\nOur experimental studies have measured various fundamental aspects of the chemistry in our laboratory at the University of Colorado, as well as in an atmospheric simulation chamber.  These experiments have focused on the sunlight-induced chemistry of a number of volatile organic compounds.  In particular, organic keto acids were identified as ideal model systems to investigate the photochemistry occurring in gas phase, solution phase and multiphase environments.  In one set of experiments, the chemical kinetics of pyruvic acid under realistic atmospheric conditions was studied using a solar simulating apparatus that reproduced the Sun?s light spectrum and other atmospheric conditions.  This study revealed new, and important, mechanistic properties of pyruvic acid photochemistry. Interestingly, it was found that the aqueous phase photochemistry of pyruvic acid generates polymers, which can contribute to secondary organic aerosol atmospheric production. \n\n \n\nOn the theoretical side, the NSF sponsored work focused on the first principles determination of rates of chemical reactions that were initiated by photochemical events.  Oxidizing agents such as the hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals are known to be significant agents in the processing of atmospheric organic species.  Often, the rates associated chemical reactions are not easily accessible to experimental measurements, and thus a theoretical estimate is of great value.  We have computed the rates of a number of these processes using high-level quantum chemistry and statistical rate theories. The results suggest a significant impact on ozone destruction in the stratosphere and troposphere.  We discovered a novel exchange process in which an HO2 radical could transfer a hydrogen atom from one location to another on a gas-phase substrate molecule.  Finally, a newly developed theoretical chemical pathway analysis appears to be a viable method to decipher the reaction routes occurring in complex chemical systems such as the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nOur work has also generated important broader impacts for the wider scientific community and society.  The findings of our work were published in widely read scientific journals making the results available to students, industry, and scientists working in various fields. This interdisciplinary study derives broad impact from the widely acknowledged importance of organic species, water and aerosols for the environment.
