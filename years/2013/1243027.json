 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate forecasts of the intensity and structure of a hurricane at landfall can save lives and mitigate social impacts. However, among recent efforts in hurricane forecast improvements, few studies have focused on landfalling hurricanes. This reflects the complexity of predicting hurricane landfalls and the uncertainties in representing the atmospheric boundary layer conditions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between landfalling hurricanes and the atmospheric boundary layer using ensemble-based data assimilation.\r\n\r\nThe study is based on two hypotheses: 1) the interaction between the hurricane and atmospheric boundary layer is an essential factor that controls the intensity and structure changes of landfalling hurricanes; and 2) the ensemble assimilation of surface mesonet and WSR-88D Doppler radar observations will improve the representation of near surface and boundary layer atmospheric conditions that interact with the landfalling hurricanes. Therefore, the research will incorporate the surface mesonet and Doppler radar observations with other available conventional and satellite data into an ensemble data assimilation system with the community mesoscale weather research and forecasting (WRF) model.  The following four scientific questions will be addressed:\r\n1.\tHow does a hurricane's structure evolve during its landfall?\r\n2.\tHow, and to what extent, do atmospheric boundary layer environmental conditions influence the intensity and structure of landfalling hurricanes?\r\n3.\tHow do the hurricane vortex and secondary circulation interact with the atmospheric boundary layer environmental conditions? \r\n4. What are the processes that control the intensity and structural changes of landfalling hurricanes?\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe research represents the first comprehensive study of the interaction between landfalling hurricanes and the atmospheric boundary layer as well as the predictability of landfalling hurricanes using ensemble-based data assimilation. Results from this study are expected to enhance our understanding of landfalling hurricanes and also contribute to the overall goals of our scientific community in improving hurricane intensity forecasts.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nResults from this study will facilitate the accurate prediction of hurricanes at landfall as well as their associated extreme winds and flooding rainfall events that have devastating effects on society and the environment in U.S. coastal regions. The broader impacts will also extend to educational goals, as graduate students will be trained during this research.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between landfalling hurricanes and the atmospheric boundary layer using numerical simulations with ensemble-based data assimilation, an advanced method that incorporates meteorological observations into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for improved initial conditions and subsequent forecasts or numerical simulations.</p>\n<p>During the whole proposed period, the PI and her research team made significant accomplishments, with 18 journal articles and 37 presentations at professional conferences. Five Ph.D. students and two M.S. students participated in the proposed projects. Research materials were used in classroom teaching and outreach activities. Part of the research results have also been transitioned to the research and operational forecasting community.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, numerical&nbsp;simulations with the community mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model showed the positive impact of assimilating surface observations (QuickScat ocean surface winds and surface Mesonet observations) into the WRF model for forecasts&nbsp;of the&nbsp;track and intensity&nbsp;of Hurricane Katrina (2015)&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;timesand&nbsp;locations&nbsp;of&nbsp;its&nbsp;two&nbsp;landfall events, especially&nbsp;<em>hurricane-associated rainfall&nbsp;</em>(e.g., Figure 1)<em>&nbsp;and surface wind</em>. In addition, incorporating ocean surface wind speeds from NASA?s Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System not only has significant impacts on tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasts but also&nbsp;<em>results in adjustments to surface fluxes</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Airborne Doppler radar and ground-based NEXRAD (WSR-88D) observations are the most commonly available observations over hurricane vortex regions before and after a hurricane?s landfall. The project made a series of developments to improve assimilation of those radar data into a numerical computer weather model for more accurate forecasts of hurricanes. For example, the project team proved the importance of using self-consistent background-error covariances in hybrid variational-ensemble data assimilation for hurricane intensity forecasts with radar observations (Figure 3). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interaction between the low-level atmosphere and the surface can influence hurricane evolution. With the NCEP Hurricane WRF model (HWRF), effects of atmospheric boundary layer vertical mixing on the numerical prediction of landfalling hurricanes were examined. It is found that stronger vertical mixing, related to the set-up in the original model, has a positive impact on numerical simulations of hurricanes over land, with better track, intensity, synoptic flow, and precipitation simulations. Following these findings, a physical parameterization scheme of eddy diffusivity for momentum was adjusted within the HWRF model, with the modification of the mixed-layer velocity for both stable and unstable conditions. Results show that the change in this parameter leads to improved simulations of hurricanes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Studies were also conducted to understand the processes associated with the evolution of&nbsp;Hurricane Harvey (2017). First, it was found that large-scale steering had a very weak role in controlling Harvey's track during its first landfall. Mesoscale vortex structures played a more critical role. Numerical simulations showed that vortex inner-core hydrometeors caused latent heating and diabatic heating, which contributed to an increase/decrease in the stability and theta-e patterns in the inner-core region, thus leading to the features of absolute vorticity structure through potential vorticity anomalies. This absolute vorticity eventually resulted in a vortex motion direction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hurricane Harvey produced record rainfall over Houston, TX. It was found that the slow motion of Hurricane Harvey over the Houston area was caused by upper-level (near 300 hPa) high-pressure system blocking. Due to its slow motion, Harvey had an opportunity to dump extreme rain over the area. Meanwhile, the mesoscale vortex and its near-vortex environment (associated with rain bands) were characterized by large convective available potential energy (CAPE) and sensible and latent heating fluxes before and during the extreme rainfall. Except for significant CAPE effects due to deep convection, surface sensible fluxes&nbsp;seemed to be very critical<em>&nbsp;</em>for convective initiation and evolution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the effects of soil moisture on the evolution of landfalling hurricanes was examined with Tropical Storm Bill (2015), which had a long lifespan (~103 h) over land. It was found that increased initial soil moisture in the land surface model before the storm's landfall tended to produce a weaker storm after landfall and had negative impacts on the storm track simulation. Further study indicated that an increase in soil moisture inside the storm corresponded with a strengthened vertical mixing within the storm boundary layer (Figure 4), which was conducive to the decay of the storm and had negative impacts on its evolution. Surface diabatic heating effects over the storm environment were also found to be an important positive contribution to the storm evolution over land, but their impacts were not as substantial as that of boundary layer vertical mixing inside the storm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results from this study are expected to enhance our understanding of landfalling hurricanes through numerical simulations and also contribute to the overall goals of our scientific community in improving hurricane intensity forecasts.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/09/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhaoxia&nbsp;Pu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307575575_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307575575_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.Impact of assimilation of surface data on precipitation forecasts of landfalling hurricanes.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307575575_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.Impact of assimilation of surface data on precipitation forecasts of landfalling hurricanes.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The figure shows 24-h accumulated precipitation (in.) valid at 1200 UTC 29 Aug. from (a) CCPA (NCEP rainfall analysis), (b) assimilation of surface Mesonet and Quickscat, (SFC) (c) assimilation of ADP conventional data, and (d) assimilation of ADP and surface Mesonet and Quickscat (ADP_SFC).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhang and Pu (2014), MWR</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhaoxia&nbsp;Pu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.Impact of assimilation of surface data on precipitation forecasts of landfalling hurricanes.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307997175_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307997175_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.Impact of CYGNSS ocean surface wind on numerical simulations of Harvey and Irma (2017).\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1243027/1243027_10231096_1581307997175_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.Impact of CYGNSS ocean surface wind on numerical simulations of Harvey and Irma (2017).\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Time series of track (a) and intensity (b: MSW; c: MSLP) forecasts for Harvey (left column; initiated at 06 UTC 21 August 2017) and Irma (right column; initiated at 0600 UTC 6 Sep. 2017).
