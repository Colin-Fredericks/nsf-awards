 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are structurally similar to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with many similar properties such as extraordinarily high mechanical strength and thermal conductivity. Unlike CNTs, BNNTs have a uniform band gap (~5.5 eV) that is not sensitive to structural variations. Furthermore BNNTs are chemically more inert than CNTs, and have a higher resistance to oxidation at high temperatures. However, there are few research groups in the world capable of producing high-quality BNNTs. Based on their unique capability in growing high-quality BNNTs researchers will investigate a scanning chemical vapor deposition (SCVD) technique. Preliminary tests of the small SCVD system have demonstrated a 10-fold higher production yield of BNNTs. The yield could potentially be further improved by 1000-fold with the use of a bigger CVD system.  \r\n\r\nIf successfully completed, this project may further the use of BNNTs in various branches of science and engineering, including 1) insulating heat sink materials for high-performance electronic devices and engines, 2) doped BNNTs for nanoelectronic and photonic devices without the need of post-synthesis sorting, 3) chemically inert and high performance ceramics/alloys/composites, 4) boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer treatment, 5) drug delivery using BNNTs.",
