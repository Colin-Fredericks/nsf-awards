 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop robust, high-performance control algorithms for Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) processes.  LMD is a class of additive manufacturing processes that builds metal parts layer by layer, introducing dynamics that propagate in time and also layer-domains.  While conventional control strategies consider only the time-domain dynamics, the layer-domain dynamics introduce significant part defects that affect process reliability and efficiency.  Physics-based 2-D (time- and layer-domain) dynamic models of the LMD process will be created and validated on a LMD machine at Missouri S&T and an industrial LMD machine at Optomec, Inc.  New Repetitive Process Control (RPC) algorithms will be developed to control the 2-D LMD dynamics addressing issues of robustness and performance.  The methodology employed may also be beneficial in other additive and layer-based manufacturing processes.\r\n \r\nThis project will spur innovation in additive manufacturing by advancing the science, education, and practice of LMD process modeling and control, potentially leading to dramatic improvements in reliability, efficiency, and productivity. Additive manufacturing processes hold tremendous potential to transform the way parts are manufactured, away from multi-step hands-on fabrication, to single-step automation directly from CAD models.  The LMD process in particular is a critically important additive manufacturing process because it is able to produce service-ready metal parts with little material waste, repair high-cost parts, and produce functional gradient material metal parts.  The PI will develop an online distance course on repetitive process control. The investigators will involve undergraduates directly in the research activities through Missouri S&T undergraduate research programs and their existing REU Site in Additive Manufacturing.  With the joint support of OIIS/ISE the PI and graduate students will collaborate with researchers in Poland to leverage expertise and facilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed new models and new control algorithms for Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) processes.  LMD is a class of additive manufacturing processes that builds metal parts layer by layer, introducing dynamics that propagate in time and also in layer-domains.  New models were created that couple the in-layer and layer-to-layer dynamics to reveal instability modes previously observed but not explained.  Validation of these models were performed on an industrial LMD machine at Optomec, Inc.  The models were used to develop new theoretical control algorithms using layer-to-layer feedback information of the printed part geometry.  An experimental LMD machine was constructed at Missouri S&amp;T to test the theoretical controllers.  The machine was constructed on a machine tool platform, incorporating off-the-shelf LMD material feed and laser systems, a laser-line scanner for measuring part geometry, and custom control hardware and software.  The new algorithms were implemented in a process that involved printing a single layer of the part, rapidly scanning it with the laser-line scanner, processing a new velocity reference profile for the next layer and repeating.  Experimental results validated the ability of the control process to successfully stabilize the unstable process dynamics in LMD. \n\nBecause LMD only directs metal powder into the melt pool, it is capable of fabricating large parts, fabricating intricate features on large parts, and repairing parts.  Thus, LMD has great potential for economic savings in many industries, especially aerospace manufacturing.  Unstable and unreliable process dynamics in LMD are a critical barrier in wider adoption of the process, often requiring expert users to design and fabricate parts in LMD.  The outcomes of this project have potential to advance LMD technology enabling more accurate and more reliable fabrication, particularly in automated fabrication.  Five graduate students (including one female) and three undergraduates (including one female) participated in the project, receiving training in LMD, dynamics and control systems, real-time software, path planning and in-process metrology.  Research results were incorporated into modules in one undergraduate course and two graduate courses, and a new graduate online course on Iterative Learning and Repetitive Control was developed.  Additionally, the PIs and students hosted girl scout groups, introducing them to, and providing hands-on experience in 3D modeling and additively manufacturing keychains of their own design.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas A Bristow"
