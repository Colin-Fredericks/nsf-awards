By facilitating restoration of functional heart tissue, this implant will significantly improve healing and recovery after heart attack.  The implant will be fabricated as a reinforced hydrogel (the cardiac patch), easily securable to the heart and capable of storing and releasing growth factors into the injured tissue.  Functional tissue restoration will be achieved through the growth of a new capillary network surrounding the injured tissue in response to the implant.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, 920,000 heart attacks (myocardial infarction) occur annually in the US.  Inadequate blood supply to the injured heart tissue is a critical limitation to healing.  Development of mature microvessel networks in the damaged tissue can therefore provide a major advance towards restoring heart function.  The cardiac patch will consist of a novel composite biomaterial composed of electrospun silk fibers dispersed through a covalently crosslinked, thiol-modified hyaluronic acid and heparin-based gel, creating a synthetic extracellular matrix.  Mature microvessel networks will be induced by controlled, sequential release of multiple growth factors from the gel and by synergistic interactions of those growth factors with hyaluronic acid.  In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that heparin-regulated growth factor release can dramatically improve the revascularization of damaged myocardium, eliciting functional, perfused vessels that restore cardiac function after ischemic injury.  Physico-chemical properties of the composite will be evaluated in vitro and its composition optimized with regard to specified design criteria.  The angiogenic capacity of patches pre-loaded with selected growth factors then sutured onto ischemic hearts will be quantified by measurement of microvessel proliferation and maturity in heart samples post-implantation.  The functionality of elicited vessels will then be determined by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging in live animals over time.  Such imaging will also allow determination of improvements in heart function.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\n\r\nBy supporting restoration of functionality to diseased heart tissue, this implant will significantly reduce the burden of suffering associated with ischemic heart damage.  The proposed investigations will establish protocols for design and fabrication of silk and hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels that restore functional cardiac tissue in diseased heart tissue by eliciting the growth of new capillary blood vessels into diseased tissue through sustained growth factor delivery.  By developing a superior matrix, our results can in due course significantly impact therapeutic treatment of heart disease.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as is described in the proposal text, the PIs have a long history of significant commitment to education, training and mentorship of students.  The proposed project will permit us to continue to engage undergraduate as well as graduate students in our ongoing research efforts, expanding the research training, educational experience and opportunities available to the students involved.  As part of the process of recruitment of students into the project, full attention will be given to the infrastructure in place in our institutions for recruiting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in research.  These include the New England Board of Higher Education Excellence through Diversity Program, a major forum for recruitment of underrepresented minority students for programs and for disseminating information about the opportunities, and the Tufts University School of Medicine minority outreach program.  For the last ten years, these programs have been highly successful in attracting underrepresented undergraduate students to spend summers at Tufts involved in biomedical science research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n        The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate a new type of implant that would be capable of preserving cardiac function following loss of blood flow within the heart wall as a result of a heart attack.  By promoting restoration of functional heart muscle, this implant would significantly reduce the disease burden and loss of life associated with heart attacks.  The implant is fabricated as a reinforced hydrogel (the cardiac patch) that can be easily secured to the heart surface with sutures and is capable of storing and releasing into the diseased tissue therapeutic biochemicals of interest.  Functional tissue restoration is achieved through the development of new capillary blood vessels within the heart wall elicited by delivery of those biochemicals.  Outcomes of the project were as follows.\n\n \n\nIntellectual merit:  First, a new type of patch was designed and developed, consisting of a composite hydrogel in which a solid silk mesh was embedded within a gel composed of crosslinked chemically modified hyaluronic acid (Figure 1).  A series of measurements of the most important physical and chemical characteristics of this composite hydrogel were carried out, including its ultrastructural characteristics, its gelation time, its swelling in the presence of water, its mechanical stiffness and its ability to store and release important drugs and chemicals of interest.  These measurements showed that the composite patch was appropriately capable of delivery of therapeutic drugs, and would be suitable for testing in animals.\n\n        In vivo experiments were then carried to test the success of the patch.  The coronary arteries of hearts in a series of living rats were tied off to simulate a heart attack (Figure 2), and patch samples containing drugs of interest were secured to the heart surface.  At a set of times following patch implantation, the animals were sacrificed, their hearts were retrieved and heart wall tissue was examined under a microscope to evaluate the response to the patch (Figure 3).  These tests showed that placement of a patch containing no drugs slightly increased the number of capillary vessels in the heart wall, but placement of a patch containing the combination of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) resulted in a significantly increased capillary vessel density (Figure 4).  This combination would therefore be expected to have the potential to have a strong effect improving the ability of the diseased heart to contract and pump blood.\n\n \n\nBroad impact:  In addition to the scientific activities, the project included a major outreach aspect intended to bring the project to wider attention beyond the immediate scientific community and to use the project to stimulate interest in scientific and medical careers among high school students.  In this outreach program, a set of high school students and teachers carry out internships in the laboratory of Dr. Peattie, the project leader, each summer.  Students carry out a series of activities introducing them to the scientific and medical environments, with the goal of fostering their interest in scientific or medical careers.  These activities include observing and working with the graduate and medical students in the lab, carrying out \"basic skills\" lab exercises supervised by Dr. Peattie, completing and presenting their own project, and attending \"show-and-tell\" presentations given by leading physicians from four departments of Tufts Medical Center.  Teachers participate in ongoing research activities in the lab, with the expectation that they will develop at least one new lesson plan for their own classes based on techniques learned in their time in the lab.  At the end of the internships, exit questionnaires are completed by the students and teachers providing comments and suggestions that are used each year to improve the program and its activities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by..."
