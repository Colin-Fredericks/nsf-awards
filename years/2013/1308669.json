 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to rework some basic foundational constructions in symplectic geometry. Symplectic invariants (usually counts of curves of various kinds) are defined using solutions to perturbed systems of equations, and the issues involved in finding coherent perturbations are not yet fully worked out. A main part of this proposal is to continue McDuff?s project with Wehrheim that reworks the traditional approach (via finite dimensional reduction) to this problem. So far, they have resolved the main topological issues, but questions concerning isotropy and how to deal with the lack of smoothness caused by gluing have yet to be worked out in detail, even in the simplest case of closed curves. Once this most basic problem has been dealt with, many important variants of the construction also need reworking, for example what happens when there is a circle symmetry. McDuff also proposes to study a variety of more geometric questions. For example, how does the existence of a very non generic holomorphic curve in a symplectic four manifold affect the other curves in the manifold? How \"bendable\" are symplectic structures: is there a circle action with isolated fixed pointswhose moment map defines a (singular) fibration over a circle?\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry has grown into a very important tool for understanding the structure of manifolds. These are spaces which, like the space-time of physics, locally look like familiar Euclidean space but might have global twisting. As in the recent solution to the Poincare conjecture concerning three dimensional manifolds, it has turned out that instead of looking at plain vanilla manifolds, one should give them extra structure: a metric (which is a way of measuring distance) or perhaps a complex or symplectic structure. The latter two involve making two-dimensional measurements (symplectic structures measure area), and are related by a mysterious mirror symmetry that was first suggested by physicists and recently given various mathematical interpretations. In its eagerness to work with these exciting new ideas from physics, the mathematical community has been using various foundational tools without setting them up with sufficient rigor. This has become a serious problem. Mathematics develops via intuition and imagination, but, because results cannot be verified by experimentation, without careful and valid proofs one is left with mere speculation. This project is largely motivated by the desire to remedy this. It proposes a detailed reworking of basic constructions (from topology and analysis) that allow one to count objects in a consistent way. Once completed, symplectic geometers will be able to move ahead with a sure way to test the correctness of their arguments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSymplectic geometry studies a structure on space that is determined by making two-dimensional measurements rather than the  one-dimensional measurements (of distances or angles) that are familiar from high school geometry.  It turns out that this structure has deep connections to the complex numbers and holomorphic structures (which are two-dimensional), rather than to the real numbers (which are one-dimensional).  Also it has deep connections with physics, both classical (as in the equations that given the motion of planets around the sun) and very modern (as in string theory and mirror symmetry).  \nGromov's work in the 1980s introduced a vital new tool --- J-holomorphic curves --- that allowed us for the first time\nto penetrate the structure of symplectic spaces.  Almost all  subsequent work in  symplectic geometry uses this tool in some form or other.  \nFor example, one can build very interesting functions that are power series whose coefficients are determined by counting special kinds of J-holomorphic curves. These functions satisfy various differential equations and, after suitable mirror transformations, agree with functions  defined by completely other methods. \n\nThough many very interesting applications of these curves were developed, even in 2012 mathematicians had still not managed to develop a  completely solid footing for the technical apsects of the theory, a fact that was increasingly detrimental to futher development since mathematicians were starting to doubt the validity of basic results.    During the course of the grant McDuff, working with Wehrheim, developed one approach to the theory in full detail that  uses atlases constructed from finite dimensional reductions.   The main outcome of the grant is a series of three substantial papers,  all now accepted for publication, that describe this approach in full detail, showing how to count closed J-holomorphic curves.  Though these papers are rather limited in scope in that in most current research people want to understand objects more complicated than a closed curve, they accomplished their purpose in that they have provided a solid basis for further developments.  For example,  John Pardon has developed an alternate way of getting information from these atlases using sheaf theory, that is widely appreciated.  Now there are several approaches to the basic results, and the field can get moving again, this time on solid ground.\n\nBesides this foundational work, McDuff has continued her work on the symplectic embedding problem, with new results, mostly joint with Cristofaro-Gardiner and Hind, on the stabilized embedding problem.
