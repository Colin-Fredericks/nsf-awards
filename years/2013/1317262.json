 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds travel awards to graduate students in logic to support their participation in meetings of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL) and those sponsored by the Association. The two main meetings of the Association, arguably the most important meetings in the field of logic, are the North American Annual Meeting and the European Summer Meeting (also known as the Logic Colloquium). The Association also meets annually at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, where it typically co-sponsors one or more events with the American Mathematical Society and/or the Mathematical Association of America, and on a rotating basis with one of the three divisions of the American Philosophical Association. ASL-sponsored meetings are held throughout the world. The Association works to ensure that its meetings and those it sponsors cover logic and its applications comprehensively, and that they represent the highest quality work being done in the field. They accordingly provide important opportunities for serious intellectual exchange, thereby serving as a stimulus to advancement of research. For graduate students in logic, the opportunity to attend any of these meetings is a vital component of their training and subsequent entry into the profession. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its North American Annual Meeting and European Summer Meeting, both held annually. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. The Association has actively sought to increase the range and number of meetings that it sponsors, a particular aim of which is to embrace new and emerging fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. This project will permit the continuation and appropriate expansion of a successful program of graduate student travel awards that the Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partially funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly effective means of bringing students in logic to important professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas with leading logicians, as well as present papers on their original research. Approximately eighty-four percent of the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2005 (the first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic. Many of these awardees have obtained excellent postdoctoral and permanent positions. Several of the early award recipients already have served on ASL or ASL-sponsored meeting program committees and have been appointed to standing committees of the Association. Further information on the Association may be found on its web site: www.aslonline.org.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this award from the NSF is to help defray travel expenses for graduate students attending the two principal annual conferences held by the Association for Symbolic Logic:  the North American Annual Meeting, a four-day meeting held every spring in North America, and the Logic Colloquium, a weeklong meeting held every summer in Europe.  This particular award covered conferences beginning in summer 2013.  In light of the coronavirus pandemic, which canceled several meetings, the grant was extended into 2022, at which time the funding it provided was finally exhausted.\n\nThese two conferences are arguably the most important meetings each year in the field of logic. Since their inception, they have been international scientific meetings of the highest standard, representing the most important work being done in the field. They cover logic comprehensively, with mathematical logic at the center but also definitely including those areas of logic with relevance to philosophy and computer science. These meetings accordingly provide important opportunities for intellectual exchange, thus acting as a stimulus to advancement of research. For graduate students in logic, the opportunity to attend one or both of these ASL meetings is a highly important component of serious participation in the profession, providing these students with opportunities to present their own work and also to meet other logicians and build networks for subsequent collaboration and professional advancement.  This award enables US-based students to compete on an equal footing with students in other nations, giving them access to the same opportunities that the Logic Colloquium (the largest annual logic meeting) provides to European and other students.  Additionally, for the North American Annual Meeting, this grant helps fund students from other nations to attend that meeting, making them aware of opportunities for logicians in the US and allowing American researchers the chance to collaborate with them.\n\nThe Assocation for Symbolic Logic, which adminsters this grant, used it to fund 178 trips by students to these meetings between 2013 and 2022.  No indirect costs were budgeted:  all the money in the grant was used for student travel.  In many cases it augmented funding provided by the student's own institution or other source, to \"bridge the gap\" and make the travel possible.  In other cases it was the sole source of funding for the trip.  The ASL makes particular efforts to make these funds available to students from groups underrepresented in mathematics, but all students are welcome to apply.  Almost half of the students funded (88 out of 178) presented their own work at the meeting they attended.  Many have now completed their doctoral degrees and gone on to disparate careers in academia, industry, and education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell G Miller"
