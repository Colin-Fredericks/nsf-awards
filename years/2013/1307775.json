While\r\nthere is a considerable amount of work in the literature for Compressive Sensing based signal\r\nprocessing with a single measurement vector, its extension to multiple measurement vectors in\r\nresource-constrained distributed systems is still at its infancy. The transformative nature of the\r\nproposed research lies in its potential to identify and solve decentralized inference problems based\r\non low dimensional sampling schemes exploiting structured models of the multiple measurement\r\nvectors collected at distributed nodes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have direct impact on advancing the theory and practice, as well as\r\non education and training. The broader impacts are: 1) Development of efficient low dimensional signal processing techniques for decentralized inference in resource-constrained distributed networks exploiting structured properties (sparsity as well as models that go beyond the simple sparsity model) of large data sets. 2) Efficient design approaches for distributed inference networks with a wide variety of applications including environmental monitoring, remote sensing, radar networks, cognitive\r\nradio networks and bio-medical applications with high dimensional data. 3) Development of graduate level courses on signal processing and inference for large data sets.
