 "awd_abstract_narration": "LittleFe is a complete 6 node Beowulf style portable computational cluster which supports shared memory parallelism (OpenMP), distributed memory parallelism (MPI), and GPGPU parallelism (CUDA). These low-cost light-weight units are well-suited for institutions and teaching environments that do not have access to parallel platforms for parallel and distributed computing education. Teaching key concepts such as speedup, efficiency, and load balancing are much more effectively done on a parallel platform. \r\n\r\nThis award is to support hosting LittleFe buildouts as part of the HPC Educators Program at the SC13 and SC14. In total, this will enable the LittleFe project to place 16 additional LittleFe units at educational institutions throughout the United States during 2013 and 2014. These units will support parallel programming and distributed computing in the undergraduate CS curriculum at 16 additional colleges and universities. They will also support student programming contests which will be hosted at e.g. the XSEDE13 and XSEDE14 conferences, and outreach events at junior and senior high schools across the United States.",

However, the accuracy of Computational Science solutions often directly depends on the available computing power:  the more powerful the computer, the more accurate the simulation.  In Parallel Computing, multiple computers are used to solve a single problem thus increasing available computing power.  Together, Computational Science and Parallel Computing impact everything from basic scientific understanding to applications in medicine, engineering and manufacturing.

Unfortunately, classroom adoption of Computational Science and Parallel Computing is limited by two factors: (1) lack of affordable hardware/software solutions for parallel computing and (2) lack of curricular material available for instructors to teach. \n\nThe overall goal of the LittleFe Workshops is to extend Computational Science and Parallel Computing into higher education coursework.  The LittleFe Workshops pursue a three-phase approach known as \"Attend, Teach and Share\".  First, faculty members attend a workshop where they build an inexpensive parallel computing cluster (called LittleFe) and discuss options for using it in teaching.  Second, faculty members take their LittleFe cluster back to their home institution and use it to teach courses, thus creating curricular material.
