Data obtained for these systems will provide tests for the generality of the theories for gel-fluid and glass-fluid transitions in colloidal systems and insights into their nonlinear rheology.\r\n\r\nWhen sub-micron to nanoscale particles are suspended in a liquid, the resulting composite material, or colloid, can adopt properties of a fluid, a solid, or something in between.  In many cases, seemingly subtle changes in the characteristics of the material can dramatically alter its mechanical rigidity and flow behavior.  This sensitivity creates both a scientific challenge and an opportunity for designing suspensions with properties tailored for specific applications.  Indeed, such control is crucial to a vast range of technologies from 3D printing to food processing and drug delivery.  This grant supports a novel avenue of investigation into colloidal suspensions that promises to expand the strategies available for controlling their rigidity and flow, particularly by elucidating the unique properties of suspensions of two sizes of particles with a tendency to stick together that can be tuned.  A key feature of the experimental program will be the application of a new x-ray technique that enables unprecedented resolution of the slow microscopic motions in soft materials at lengths as small as a molecule.  The development of these x-ray methods for investigating materials under deformation and flow will have impact far beyond the planned experiments by providing a new tool with application that spans several traditional disciplines including physics, chemical engineering, and the biosciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA gel is formed when small particles suspended in solution become unstable to aggregation, ultimately forming a system-spanning network that imparts mechanical rigidity to the system.  Although this rigidity makes gels behave like solids, under sufficient stress, they can be made to flow, and in many cases, they recover their solid-like properties after cessation of the stress.  Knowledge about colloidal gel formation and flow behavior has implications for understanding and controlling the properties of many materials we encounter every day, including foods such as yogurt, personal care products like cosmetics, and medicines.  At the same time, more fundamentally, gels exhibit physical behavior that can help address challenging scientific problems about the nature of fluid-solid transitions.  This project brought to bear newly developed experimental capabilities employing advanced x-ray scattering methods to interrogate the salient microscopic processes dictating the properties of gels.  One thrust of the research focused on gel formation and a second thrust focused on the deformation and flow of gels.    \n\nAs part of the first thrust, we studied the transformation from fluid to gel in aqueous suspensions of nanometer-scale silica particles.  Taking advantage of the ability to precisely tune the strength of the particle attractions, we tracked the evolution in the microscopic organization and mobility of the particles and correlated these properties with the time-dependent macroscopic mechanical behavior of the suspensions.  We found that, while the rate of gel formation was highly sensitive to the strength of attraction, the suspensions nevertheless proceeded through identical intermediate states of microscopic and macroscopic behavior even as the time needed to form a gel varied by orders of magnitude. To explain these observations, we proposed a model of gel formation in the regime of weak attraction in which network formation is a hierarchical process whose initiation depends on the creation and stability of small clusters of particles arranged in particularly favorable configurations.  These findings and this interpretation provide important insight into key questions that have puzzled researchers.  Namely, why can gels take so long to form even though the constituent nanoparticles are rapidly diffusing through the suspension? And, why is this rate of gelation so sensitive to the strength of attraction between the particles? \n\nBuilding on this study, we further examined gel formation in mixtures of two sizes of nanoparticles.  Here, we made the surprising discovery that gels formed by the mixtures are stable to markedly weaker inter-particle attractions than those formed by the corresponding suspensions of a single particle size.  We traced this effect to a process in which two sizes separate microscopically and the smaller particles take the lead in forming the rigid network.  This observation introduces an avenue of scientific exploration into gels, in which the subtle interplay of particle size distribution and attraction strength can lead to strongly varying behaviors.  It also indicates a new route for controlling aggregation in suspensions and their mechanical behavior.\n\nThe second thrust of the project involved experiments that interrogated the re-arrangements among the particles in a gel as it yielded mechanically in response to an oscillating applied force.  We found the gels underwent a sharp transition in which the particles began to rearrange their positions irreversibly above a threshold amplitude of macroscopic deformation; however, macroscopically the gels began to weaken well below this threshold.  The regions of particles undergoing rearrangement had an intriguing size distribution, which is shared by a wide range of phenomena in nature from earthquakes to fluid invasion of porous rocks.  Beyond the insight this study provided into the mechanical behavior of gels, it showed how the x-ray techniques we employed can be a valuable tool more generally for studying and assessing the internal nanometer-scale motions associated with failure of solids when subjected to a load.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Leheny"
