 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Alice B. Kelly from the University of California - Berkeley will investigate the ways in which crime, both resource related and non-resource related crime, serve as threats to ecological and recreational sustainability in the Nation's National Parks.  This award has support from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Directorate for Geosciences and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelly will study the correlation of crime rates with:  (1) the geographic location of each protected area; (2) the extent of government and external funding for national parks; (3) specific Federal and State laws/policies that impact National Parks; and (4) the ecological condition and visitation rates of specific parks.  Research will concentrate on National Parks in the western United States.\r\n\r\nThe aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to develop improved policies to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the Nation's National Parks.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelly will be working with collaborators Prof. Maggi Kelly of the Department of Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management of UC-Berkeley as well as Rene S. Buehl of the National Park Service. Dr. Kelly will also work with software developers and other professionals in the Department of the Interior to improve the current Incident Reporting System to include the kind of GIS data that will be produced in this work.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVery little research has been performed on the incidence of crime in U.S. National Parks.  Those studies that do exist are often anecdotal or park-specific.  Further, little has been published about the history of law enforcement in the National Park Service.  This study helped fill these two gaps in the literature through an intensive study of reported crime in the National Park Service?s Pacific West Region.  Using participant observation, interviews, surveys, archival data collection, and the collection of publicly available data, this study sought to understand which factors internal and external to National Parks significantly influenced park recorded crime statistics.  \n\nDrawing upon interviews with National Park Service Rangers, over 90 factors were identified as potential drivers of crime in National Parks.  Data on these 90 factors were collected with the help of six undergraduate students, two graduate students, and two researchers at U.C. Berkeley.  Statistical analyses were run to understand which of these factors were significantly correlated with park crime statistics.  It was found that factors internal to parks such as the presence of park concessionaires, the number of park rangers present within a park, and the number of visitor hours were positively correlated with park crime statistics.  Conversely, factors such as high trail densities in National Parks were negatively correlated with park crime statistics.  It was found that factors external to parks such as private land ownership in lands surrounding parks and higher levels of education in populations surrounding parks were negatively correlated with park crime statistics.  Factors such as higher percentages of publicly held land in areas surrounding parks, higher numbers of vacant units in lands abutting parks, and lower levels of education in population surrounding parks were significantly positively correlated with park crime statistics.  \n\nThis first-level analysis of factors influencing park crime statistics paves the way for more in-depth analyses of park crime in the United States.  The findings of this study may help the National Park Service make important decisions about community outreach, infrastructure development, and staffing in the future to make parks safer, more efficiently policed spaces.  One of the products of this study has been the development of a decision-support tool that allows law enforcement rangers at different parks understand how changing certain variables may influence the recorded crime within their parks.  \n\nA part of this study also included research on the history of law enforcement in the U.S. National Park Service.  A study based on archival research and interviews with park rangers across the country revealed that the history of law enforcement in the Park Service has been varied, contested, and fluctuating over time.  The acceptance of the outward performance of law enforcement in the National Park Service has been heavily influenced by political, historical, and economic shifts over time and continues to be a subject of debate.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alice B Kelly"
