These activities include workshops and working groups, the visiting scientist program and the Complex Systems Summer School.  SFI is a private, non-profit independent research and education institution that occupies a unique place in the academic landscape. It is dedicated to long-term, creative, trans-disciplinary research across the physical, computational, biological and social sciences, focusing on complex adaptive systems.   This support will expand the inclusion of the broader scientific community in the activities at SFI, maintain the robustness of the workforce development activities, and allow for discovering and communicating to a broad audience the common fundamental principles in complex physical, computational, biological, and social systems.  The award will permit SFI to explore new research areas through workshops and working groups, to expand the breadth of its international scientific community, and to provide support for its educational activities.",
