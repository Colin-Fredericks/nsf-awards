 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pleiades is the best studied open star cluster in the sky. It is one of the primary open clusters used to define the \"Zero Age Main Sequence\" and hence it serves as a cornerstone for programs which use main-sequence fitting to derive distances to other clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy. This role is called into question by the \"Pleiades distance controversy\"; the distance to the Pleiades from the Hipparcos space astrometry mission of about 120 pc is significantly different from the distance of 133 pc derived from other techniques. In order to resolve this issue, the PI will use Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to derive a new, independent trigonometric parallax distance to the Pleiades. He will complete all VLBI measurements for the sample of ten Pleiads and any necessary auxiliary measurements with optical and infrared telescopes.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of this project the Pleiades distance controversy will be resolved, solidifying the use of the Pleiades in determining Galactic structure. In lockstep, the PI will launch a multi-faceted education program that is aimed at the recruitment, retention, and advancement of minority groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",

Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia; the 1,000-foot-diameter William E. Gordon Telescope of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico; and the Effelsberg Radio Telescope in Germany to resolve a controversy over the distance to the famous Pleiades star cluster. This controversy posed a potential challenge to scientists' basic understanding of how stars form and evolve; this work shows that a previous measurement made by a European star-mapping research satellite was wrong and that our fundamental understanding of stellar processes is correct.<br /><br />The \"Seven Sisters\" star cluster in the constellation Taurus, easily seen in the winter sky, includes hundreds of young stars formed about 100 million years ago. As a nearby example of such young clusters, the Pleiades have served as a critical laboratory for refining scientists' understanding of how similar clusters form. In addition, astronomers have used the measured physical characteristics of Pleiades stars as a tool for estimating the distance to other, more distant, clusters.<br /><br />Until the 1990s, the consensus was that the Pleiades are about 430 light-years from Earth. However, the European satellite Hipparcos, launched in 1989 to precisely measure the positions and distances of thousands of stars, produced a distance measurement of only about 390 light-years. Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations in the radio of several Pleiades stars were conducted over about a year and a half to precisely measure their apparent shift caused by the Earth's rotation around the Sun. Seen at opposite ends of the Earth's orbit, the star appears to move slightly against the backdrop of more-distant cosmic objects. Called parallax, the technique is the most accurate distance-measuring method astronomers have, and relies on simple trigonometry. The result of this work is a distance to the Pleiades of 443 light-years, accurate to within one percent. At the time of publication, this was the most accurate and precise measurement made of the Pleiades distance and even now it remains competitive with that from a new European star-mapping satellite, Gaia. This research was published in the journal Science and was the featured cover article.<br /><br />Student involvement was featured throughout this work, typically including individuals from underrepresented groups within the sciences. In total, roughly a dozen students ranging in level from high-school to college undergraduate participated in this project. In addition to mentoring activities, the PI also was involved in an institutional effort to develop and roll out an equity, diversity, and inclusion strategy that seeks to help improve overall campus climate and remove barriers for underrepresented groups to become involved in and be successful in academia.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/25/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carl&nbsp;A&nbsp;Melis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249447194_F1.medium--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249447194_F1.medium--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pleiades Research Featured on the Cover of Science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249447194_F1.medium--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pleiades Research Featured on the Cover of Science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pleiades distance research featured on the cover of Science Magazine, where the work was published in 2014.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Science Magazine</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carl&nbsp;A&nbsp;Melis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pleiades Research Featured on the Cover of Science</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249839012_gaia_pleiades_distances--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249839012_gaia_pleiades_distances--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pleiades Distances\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577249839012_gaia_pleiades_distances--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pleiades Distances\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Updated figure from Science publication (Melis et al. 2014, Science 345, 1029) showing distances measured for the Pleiades cluster, including that from this work (\"VLBI\") and a recent measurement by the European Gaia satellite (\"Gaia DR1\").</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, A&A 595, A2</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carl&nbsp;A&nbsp;Melis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pleiades Distances</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250014353_Parallax-Illustration-with-Pleiades-5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250014353_Parallax-Illustration-with-Pleiades-5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Parallax Technique for the Pleiades\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250014353_Parallax-Illustration-with-Pleiades-5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Parallax Technique for the Pleiades\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Artists illustration showing how the parallax technique yields distance measurements for celestial objects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NRAO</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carl&nbsp;A&nbsp;Melis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Parallax Technique for the Pleiades</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250382827_melis_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250382827_melis_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pleiades Cluster Star Parallaxes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313428/1313428_10267272_1577250382827_melis_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pleiades Cluster Star Parallaxes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">On-sky motion measurements for 5 Pleiades cluster stars (presented relative to an arbitrary reference position) and over-plotted models that include proper motion and parallax.
