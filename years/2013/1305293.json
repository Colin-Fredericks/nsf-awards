 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: To date, single-crystal semiconductor films grown on single-crystal substrates are used in high-performance semiconductor devices. However, single-crystal substrates are expensive for large-area applications such as solar cells and display. Polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor films can be low cost, but the efficiency is poor. The creation of near-single-crystal thin films in this project points to a new paradigm on the fabrication of a wide range of semiconductors on flexible metal sheets with superior optoelectronic properties that can be widely implemented in solar cell and display technologies at a low cost and with a reduction in material utilization. In addition, fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of different thin-film texture, domain and defect formations can impact broadly on many areas of research such as texture formation of electrodes in fuel cells, anisotropic magnetic recording, and high-temperature superconducting materials. The project integrates research, education, and outreach activities. In addition to training PhD students, research projects suitable for undergraduate students to participate are created. The research team also has active outreach activities including the participation of New York State New Visions STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) program for capital district high-school seniors. These efforts will enhance students' interest in pursuing science and engineering careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The research team studies the epitaxial growth of near-single-crystal semiconductor films such as Ge on flexible, cube-textured Ni(100) sheets. These sheets are low-cost materials having very large grains ranging from 50 to 100 micrometers in size with all the grains having approximately the same in-plane and out-of-plane orientations. Most semiconductors do not grow epitaxially on metals such as Ni due to the alloying reaction at the semiconductor-metal interface. In this project, this alloying reaction is prevented by depositing an epitaxial layer of CaF2(111) on the Ni(100) sheet as a buffer layer and as a diffusion barrier. Near-single-crystal Ge(111) is then epitaxially grown on the buffered Ni(100) substrate. A key goal of the project is the reduction/elimination of the Ge(111) rotational domains that may occur during the growth due to dissimilar symmetry between the film and the substrate and also the passivation of the domain boundaries when they occur. Computational modeling using atomistic methods, including quantum-mechanical density functional theory, are employed to assist the experimental optimization of the growth parameters and to understand the structural and electronic properties of domain boundaries and their passivation. Our ultimate goal is to produce near-single-crystal Ge films as scalable substrates to grow functional semiconductors such as CdTe, GaAs, or Si with optoelectronic qualities as good as or close to that of single crystals.",

However, single crystal substrates are too expensive for large area applications such as solar cells and display. Most low-cost commercial large area devices are either polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductors on glass or metal substrates with less than ideal performance and long term stability problems. In this work we have employed a special type of Ni metal sheets as substrates to grow near-single crystal semiconductors such as Ge films. The flexible Ni substrates have a preferred crystal orientation in the (001) direction and very large grains over 50 microns that possess similar crystal orientation. To prevent metal diffusion into the semiconductor, a CaF<sub>2</sub>(001) buffer layer has been successfully grown by thermal evaporation of CaF<sub>2</sub> on the Ni(001) substrates with the same orientation, that is the CaF<sub>2</sub> film is epitaxially grown on the Ni substrate. The final step was to grow epitaxial Ge film on top of CaF<sub>2</sub>(001)/Ni(001) and was successfully executed. In addition it was found that the grains in the Ge film have similar sizes of 50 microns as compared to that of the Ni grains. Figure 1 shows a scanning electron microscopy image of the surface of the Ge(001) film grown on CaF<sub>2</sub>(001)/Ni(001) substrate. This is compared to the similar size Ni grains shown in Figure 2. Because of the large grain size, these 50 micron grains Ge film will act like single crystals from the electrical performance point of view.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key challenge was to grow the CaF<sub>2</sub> film on Ni(001) surface with the same (001) orientation. &nbsp;Traditionally only CaF<sub>2</sub>(111) can be grown on a Ni(001) surface. The problem with CaF<sub>2</sub>(111) on Ni(001) is that there are multiple orientational domains in the CaF<sub>2</sub> film with a high density of domain boundaries. These domains are much smaller than that of the Ni grains. Based on our theoretical calculations using atomistic methods (including quantum-mechanical density function theory), the domain boundaries with large angle between domains can lead to electronic traps that are detrimental to the performance of devices made out of these films. However, in an attempt to overcome this challenge, it was found that CaF<sub>2</sub>(001) orientation with no orientational domains can be achieved by a special cleaning process prior to the CaF<sub>2 </sub>deposition, namely, through a pure hydrogen gas annealing of the Ni(001) substrate. The CaF<sub>2</sub>(001) orientation on Ni(001) surface is also supported by our theoretical calculations when the interface energy is minimized. Figure 3 shows a ball model illustrating the Ge(001)/CaF<sub>2</sub>(001)/Ni(001) stack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The large grain size epitaxial Ge films can serve as a template to grow other important high performance electronic materials such as CdTe and GaAs films for low cost solar cells and displays applications. To date, the highest efficient solar cells are made of GaAs film grown on single crystal Ge substrates.
