 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Jason Belitsky from Oberlin College to study the formation and structure of eumelanin, a pigment in humans that serves as a photoprotective agent.  Current research suggests that eumelanin is formed from the self-assembly of dihydroxyindole oligomers and nanoparticles.  Well-defined dihydroxyindole oligomers will be synthesized via iterative Suzuki coupling routes, and the self-assembly of these oligomers, their oxidation products, and metal ions will be studied using techniques such as NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Structure-activity relationships in the formation of micro- and nano- scale assemblies from well-defined oligomers will be sought to provide a molecular level understanding of eumelanin structure.  In the long term, understanding the chemical and photophysical properties of eumelanin is an important goal given its incompletely defined biological functions and potential role in pathologies. \r\n\r\nDespite public interest in melanin, its complexity and heterogeneity have provided obtacles to its study.  Melanin is certainly a biopolymer with an important role in human biology, with particular significance in the biology of the skin and hair and a likely connection to pathologies such as skin cancer.  A greater understanding of the chemistry of melanins would help illuminate their roles in human biology and disease, as well as in melanin-based materials for engineering, environmental, and biological applications. However, a fundamental understanding of melanins lags far behind other biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA.  Here, the Beltisky group will use synthetic model compounds in a \"bottom-up\" approach toward the understanding of the formation and structure of eumelanin. As has been the case in the Belitsky group, undergraduate researchers will form the backbone of the research team.  Additionally, the PI plans to integrate the research with his teaching at Oberlin College, such that up to 60 undergraduates per year get exposure to research-level synthetic chemistry transformations as part of their sophomore-level organic chemistry laboratory course experience.",

Melanins are biological pigments; humans have two main types that contribute to our skin and hair color: eumelanin, which is brown to black, and pheomelanin, which is yellow to red.

Through a course-based research experience (CRE) in CHEM 254, approximately 60 undergraduates per year participated in the project and generated key results. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n             There is a large disconnect between public interest in melanin and our scientific understanding, despite the role of melanins in human skin and hair color, suntans, dermatological conditions such as vitiligo, and its intimate connection to the growing problem of skin cancer.  Less well known to the general public, melanins and related biomaterials have become the inspiration for significant advances in materials science. A greater understanding of the chemistry of melanins will help illuminate their roles in human biology and disease, as well as in melanin-based materials for engineering, environmental, and biological applications.  However, a fundamental understanding of melanins lags far behind other biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA.  Partially, this is due to inherent complexities in the formation and structure of the pigments.  To form eumelanin, the initial monomers (tyrosine/L-dopa) are oxidized to become new monomers known as dihydroxyindoles.  These react with each other to form heterogeneous oligomers.  The oligomers self-assemble into nanoparticles, which further aggregate to form nano- and micro-scale structures.\n\n            Using the tools of modern bioorganic chemistry, we approached the problem of eumelanin structure and assembly from three directions: (1) synthesis of well-defined dihydroxyindole oligomers (protected as dimethoxyindoles) for self-assembly studies at a molecular level of detail; (2) oxidative polymerizations to rapidly access synthetic eumelanin and related materials; and (3) screenings of small molecules as modulators of the synthetic eumelanin polymerizations.  In collaboration with the CHEM 254 class, we screened over 150 compounds, finding many that can as probes for eumelanin assembly and the assembly of well-defined oligomers.  Additional work with polymerization-based systems focused on interactions will metal ions; some of these model systems have potential for lead sequestration and colorimetric sensing.  We developed methods for the synthesis of well-defined dimethoxyindole oligomers and other derivatives.  Studies of the self-assembly of these oligomers, their oxidation products, and metal ions are ongoing via techniques such as NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Structure-activity relationships in the formation of micro- and nano- scale assemblies from well-defined oligomers will provide a molecular level of detail to our understanding of eumelanin structure.  Along with our current findings, this will enhance our understanding of the eumelanin chemistry and biochemistry, which informs its biological functions and roles in pathologies.  Additionally, our results will be useful for the development of melanin-based/inspired materials, including those with potential environmental applications such as melanin-based/inspired colorimetric metal-ion sensors and lead-sequestration agents, which we are pursuing at Oberlin.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n            Co-workers on the project have included a postdoctoral scholar, 22 undergraduate students (10 female) in the PI's lab, and 283 student participants through the course-based research project (CRE) in CHEM 254.
