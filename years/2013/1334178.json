 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to establish methodologies for error prediction and control of geometric shapes associated with a wide range of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. The ultimate goal is to overcome a major barrier of direct digital manufacturing: inadequate dimensional accuracy in current AM processes.  The proposed research strategy is to establish a methodological framework for system-level, smart, and high precision shape error compensation and control.   The research plan consists of four research tasks: (1) modeling and prediction of profile deviations for complex shapes;  (2) efficient experimental designs and analysis strategies for modeling profile deviations; (3) optimal compensation and smart shape-to-shape control of profile deviations, and (4) experimental investigation and validation.\r\n \r\nSuccessful completion of the project is expected to significantly improve the geometric accuracy of AM-built products.  The research will produce new knowledge regarding system-level or universal geometric shape accuracy control methodologies to reduce duplicated efforts for wider and quicker adoption of AM technologies, and high-precision and smart shape-to-shape compensation methodologies to avoid post-processing and extensive process calibration efforts prior to production. The research outcomes including patents will facilitate wider and quicker adoption of AM technology, spurring manufacturing innovations and job creation.  The research project will provide new curriculum on AM technology and manufacturing education. Inter-university workshops and video conferences involving faculty and graduate students have been and will continue to be organized for synergistic collaborations.",

In contrast to traditional material removal processes, AM constructs products by adding material layer by layer.&nbsp; The paradigm shift created by AM can amount to a <em>third industrial revolution</em>, according to a special report on manufacturing and innovation by <em>The Economist</em> magazine.</p>\n<p>However sophisticated the technology might be, AM-manufactured products still suffer from deformations from the intended geometric shapes. Although such deformations may not be readily perceptible, they may affect the functionalities of the products. This leads us to the important question: how can we quantify shape deformation of AM-manufactured products, and prevent them? Our joint collaborative research with the University of Southern California has provided a framework for addressing quality control issues in additive manufacturing. This framework has three key components: (a) representing geometric shape deformation using polar coordinates (see Figure 2 titled &ldquo;Visualization of deformation in polar coordinates&rdquo; for an example), (b) predicting deformation for new shapes using deformation data obtained from existing shapes, and (c) applying a compensation to the new product, anticipating the predicted deformation.</p>\n<p>To understand components (b) and (c), refer to Figure 2 titled &ldquo;The compensation approach&rdquo;. Suppose one plans to manufacture a cylindrical product whose cross section should be a circle of radius 1 inch. However, based on past data, it is predicted that under the set conditions, the system that manufactures the product would shrink the circle to one with radius 0.95 inch. In that case, while designing the product, the user would aim for a radius of 1.05 inch to obtain the desired product eventually.</p>\n<p>Our research team has established an optimal compensation policy for in-plane (x-y plane) shape deformation and already successfully implemented it to reduce shape deformation of cylindrical products by 90% and of polyhedrons by 75%. However, the compensation-based approach works only if we can predict the deformation of a shape. Given the wide diversity of AM-manufactured products, predicting deformation of each individual shape by creating a test product is cost prohibitive. Therefore, the aim is to pool information across different shapes chosen judiciously and subsequently predict deformation for new, untested shapes.</p>\n<p>Our research has provided important breakthroughs in making successful predictions about deformation patterns from polygon or freeform shapes. &nbsp;As an illustration, Figure 4 titled &ldquo;Prediction of deformation of an irregular polygon&rdquo; reported in the peer-reviewed article &ldquo;Bayesian model building from small samples of disparate data&rdquo; accepted for publication in Technometrics depicts the prediction of deformation from an irregular polygon. It is clear that the predictions are consistent with the actual deformation.</p>\n<p>Our research also paves a way for sequentially manufacturing new products and expanding the library of information on deformation. As an illustration, consider Figure 1 titled &ldquo;Fitted deformation models for circles&rdquo; that shows the prediction performance of a single fitted deformation model for three circles of radius 0.5, 1.5 and 3 inch circles. This model can now predict deformation of a circle with an arbitrary radius with a specific level of uncertainty. The question is, if one more circular product needs to be manufactured in order to improve the prediction performance (reduce its uncertainty), what should be the radius of that product?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This question can be answered from Figure 5 titled &ldquo;Prediction variances of circle deformation models&rdquo; that shows the levels of uncertainty of the fitted models plotted against the radius (horizontal axis) and the polar angle (vertical axis). The figure shows that the prediction variance is highest in the interval 2-2.5 inches, and for angles in the range 5-6 (that is equivalent to 300-360 degrees). This is intuitive from the Figure &ldquo;Fitted deformation models for circles&rdquo;, because the difference deformation patters across curves appear to increase in this region.</p>\n<p>The results indicate that the outcomes of this project can significantly improve the geometric accuracy of AM-built products and consequently contribute to the knowledge base of process data analytics for smart manufacturing. Engineers can implement the proposed methods easily by using the computer programs developed. The simulation and calibration-based approach developed in the last year has tremendous potential of integrating physical knowledge and adaptive empirical learning algorithms to make quicker, more reliable predictions.</p>\n<p>Four doctoral students have benefitted from working on this project.
