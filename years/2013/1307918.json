 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches\r\nThe objective of this research is to create a new form of holographic polymer film that can redirect sunlight over daily and yearly variations in order to enable passive solar concentrators for energy generation and passive solar lighting for energy conservation.  The approach is to tailor the polymer reaction and diffusion rates such that the holograms can grow to 25 times the efficiency typical of such materials, enabling many thin and 100% efficient films to be stacked into a single sheet.    Design tools for these angle and color selective films will be created to guide the fabrication and test of functional samples.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe research will advance soft materials science by investigating optically-initiated, strong segregation of polymers in solid films.   Specialized theoretical and numerical design tools will exploit this enhanced control over 3D material properties to enable new classes of polymer optical devices with large refractive index gradients.  High-throughput film fabrication processes will be created to realize these designs in economically-relevant costs and sizes.  In cooperation with two industrial partners, the program will then fabricate and test specialized films for solar generation and conservation applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe program will establish a satellite research hub at an undergraduate liberal arts college.  Undergraduates will investigate materials during the academic year, then spend summers integrating results into the larger program at the University of Colorado.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary technical goal of this program was to increase the performance of a holographic recording material sufficiently for it to manipulate the full visible spectrum with high efficiency.   These materials are formed of two distinct polymers that form a gel: a solid host swollen with a liquid.  We typically choose the host polymer to be a urethane &ndash; the same material used for auto body clear coats &ndash; because of its excellent optical properties and toughness.  The liquid component is a high refractive index photopolymer that, when exposed to light, attaches to the matrix.  The matrix swells into nearby regions that were not exposed, increasing the concentration of high refractive index polymer in the illuminated areas.  By exposing such a material to a periodic optical intensity such as that generated by interference of two laser beams, the material can record diffraction gratings including lenses and color filters.  The attached images show each of these.\n\n \n\nWe created new materials with increased index contrast (and thus diffraction efficiency) and new chemical approaches with increased mechanical robustness.  These were supported by new metrology tools and theoretical models of how these materials develop index in response to light.  These models will guide future materials development for applications of holographic optical elements in, for example, augmented reality optics.\n\n \n\nAs part of the GOALI program, the university teamed with two local small businesses.  Akonia Holographics is a startup R&amp;D firm now focused on holographic photopolymers for the augmented reality market.  Its cofounders and early employees include multiple PhD graduates of CU Boulder including two from the PI?s group.   Light Louver is a small for-profit businesses that designs and builds passive solar lighting modules.  They worked with the university team to analyze and ultimately select a new design that is smaller and cheaper than their previous approach.  Prototypes are in testing as of this report.\n\n \n\nThe outreach program of this award established a pipeline for talented, primarily underrepresented, Physics majors from Carleton College in Minnesota to participate in the research.  Students began research with Prof. Marty Baylor at Carleton, then spent the summer in the PI?s labs in Boulder CO.  All the participants have proceeded on to graduate school.  One, Madeline Chosey, won the Goldwater Scholarship &ndash; the most prestigious undergraduate STEM award nationwide. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert R Mcleod"
