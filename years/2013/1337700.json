The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) surface-enhanced Raman scattering on noble metal coated metal nanotips; (b) detection of NO in blood and tissue; (c) nanopore-facilitated loading of nanosharps; (d) functionally-graded silica films and their characterization on multiple length scales; and (e) aerogel cross-linking.\r\n\r\nRaman spectroscopy measures the vibrational frequencies of molecules in a sample which are characteristic of the chemical content, composition and structure of the material. A Raman microscope scans across a sample to provide a spatial image of the chemical composition in response to the laser probe. This widely used technique, employing lasers to probe the material, is non-destructive. This instrument will strengthen graduate and undergraduate education as students use this instrument in their research projects and in laboratory courses.",
