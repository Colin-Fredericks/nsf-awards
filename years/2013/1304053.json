The discovery and development of new surface processes and the improvement of existing ones can make important contributions to securing the nation's energy supply. \r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for the 2013 Gordon Conference on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces. The conference, which will be held at the Les Diablerets Conference Center in Les Diablerets, Switzerland on April 28- May 3, 2013, will bring together leading experts to discuss the latest and most exciting work in the field. The change in venue will increase participation by European scientists. The themes and topics are chosen to illustrate broad concepts in surface chemistry of academic and industrial interest. Topics include: \r\n- catalysis at surfaces, \r\n- synthesis of surfaces and novel materials, \r\n- tribology, \r\n- liquids at surfaces and other interface studies, \r\n- surface  photochemistry,\r\n-fundamental surface chemistry studies.\r\n\r\nA special effort will be made to support young scientists who otherwise would be unable to attend: junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues. The setting and program for the conference keeps the participants on site and maximizes interactions and intellectual discourse and networking.",
