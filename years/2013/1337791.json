 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Kennesaw State University (KSU) to acquire a Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) for use in a diverse series of research and teaching applications across multiple disciplines. The FACS instrument will be used to identify, isolate, and purify a broad range of cells and cell components including mouse embryonic stem cells, neurons, muscle cells, bacteria, organelles, and liposomes. These FACS-purified samples will further research programs that seek to understand brain, muscle, and skeletal development and function, as well as the mechanisms behind bacterial locomotion,a key factor in bacterial pathogenicity. In addition, the FACS will be used to identify and isolate cells possessing novel proteins of interest and for the isolation of specific cell types during molecular cloning studies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to expansion of research capabilities, the acquisition of cell sorting technology will offer new avenues for course development in the science curriculum at KSU. FACS experiments will be employed in undergraduate courses, bringing state-of-the art instrumentation to cell biology, microbiology, chemistry, and biochemistry instruction. FACS experiments will also be introduced to the graduate curricula in biology and biochemistry, complementing existing instructional modules in flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Opportunities for cell sorting experiments will facilitate recruitment, training, retention, and graduation of undergraduate researchers in multiple STEM programs. These include those funded by the KSU Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, the College of Science and Mathematics, and the National Science Foundation's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). Students trained in flow cytometry and FACS skills will be more competitive for jobs in the biotechnology arena and will be better prepared for enrollment into STEM graduate programs. Finally, the powerful capabilities of cell sorting will promote international collaborations, engaging overseas students in research endeavors at our institution and promoting a culture of global learning.",
