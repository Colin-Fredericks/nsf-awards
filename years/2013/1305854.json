 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports a series of four national and international Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, to be held in 2013, organized by the National Academy of Engineering for early career researchers:  German-American FOE (April 26-28 in Irvine, California), China-America FOE (May 15-17 in Beijing, China), U.S. FOE (September 19-21 in Wilmington, Delaware), and European Union-U.S. FOE (November 21-23 in Chantilly, France). Each symposium focuses on four topical areas. The topics for the 2013 symposia are the following: social media, flexible electronics, renewable energy, smart manufacturing, biomass conversion, materiomics, transport in complex systems, additive manufacturing, nanomaterials, solar energy, bio-MEMS, future of the Internet, nanosensors, big data, future of transportation, and wireless broadband. About 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and one-half day symposium includes four formal sessions, technical tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. \r\n\r\nThe FOE symposia provide early career scientists and engineers the opportunity for sharing research insights and techniques to foster new collaborations and, in the case of the bilateral meetings, deepen technical and cultural understanding between the countries' participants. The symposia foster interdisciplinary and international collaborations and serve as a reference point for many of the emerging frontiers in research and innovation in the United States. American innovative capacity is strengthened through these exchanges. Papers from the U.S. FOE symposium will be published in a volume available on the National Academies Press website at http://www.nap.edu.",
