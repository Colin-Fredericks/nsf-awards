 "awd_abstract_narration": "The creation, management, and access of data is key to the advancement of the state-of-the-art in computer science. Currently many research and educational activities in social network, web mining, multimedia retrieval, and high performance computing, just to name a few, need to involve big data. However, existing infrastructure of the Computer Science Department at Texas State University falls far behind its increasing research and educational needs.\r\n\r\nThis project builds a shared high-performance data center, providing the fundamental facilities to collect, process, and manage large volumes of data. The new data center supplies the necessary computational power and storage to support the exploration and development of new research and technologies within and beyond the department in the fields of computer vision, wireless network, information retrieval, data mining, human computer interaction, software engineering, high performance computing, and security. The data center also supports quality undergraduate and graduate student research experience, enables the integration of research and education, encourages inter-departmental and cross-university collaborations, and promotes the Ph.D. program development in the Computer Science Department. The developed infrastructure will significantly enhance the current research and educational capabilities of the department, university, and community.\r\n",
