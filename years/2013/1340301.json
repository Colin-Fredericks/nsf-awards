 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes and operates the EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN)\r\nCollaboration and Cyberinfrastructure for Paleogeosciences (C4P) to advance the role of cyberinfrastructure\r\n(CI) in unraveling the large-scale, long-term evolution of the Earth-Life System through the\r\nstudy of the geological record.Paleogeosciences research into our large-scale, long-term Earth-Life system is an ambitious\r\nprogram that informs public debate on human stewardship of the earth and has - since its inception\r\n- caught public imagination on issues such as species survival under environmental changes.\r\nIn the last decade, fresh discoveries, plus the application of new technologies of measurement,\r\ndata analysis, and modeling have revitalized the science. Bringing to bear recent advances\r\nin computing and mathematics will further quicken the pace of discoveries, synthesis and publication\r\nin the science. This RCN intends to stimulate and grow CI-focused collaborations and\r\npartnerships among paleogeoscientists, paleobiologists, bioinformaticists, stratigraphers,\r\ngeochronologists, geographers, data scientists, and computer scientists that will help dissolve\r\nexisting intellectual barriers to dramatically improve the application of modern data management\r\napproaches, data mining technologies, and computational methods to better analyze the heterogeneous\r\nand sparse data of the Earth record in sediments, rocks, and ice within the paleogeosciences\r\nand other domains and disciplines.\r\n\r\nActivities envisioned include a series of coordinated workshops and webinars, web-enabled networking, outreach events such\r\nas symposia and town-hall meetings, and cross-EarthCube coordination, and creation of an interoperable\r\nC4P resource catalog that will be integrated with other EarthCube resource inventories. High-priority\r\nthemes in C4P are the management and representation of age and age uncertainty in data models\r\nand computation to advance interoperability among and analysis of time-referenced data types,\r\nthe integration of physical samples into digital data infrastructure, and the need to properly\r\ntrack and attribute provenance of data to ensure trust in the data and credit to authors.",
