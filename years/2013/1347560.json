 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most dramatic changes now underway in the polar cryosphere is the several-fold speedup of Greenland and West Antarctic outlet glaciers.   Computational models of ice sheets face considerable challenges in correctly   simulating these events, which in turn, limits glaciologists' and climatologists' ability to predict future change.  The challenge arises from limited knowledge of key variables, for example, the shape of the land surface beneath the ice. Data limitations present two problems; first, important details of ice behavior may be missed and second, models may produce results that compare well with observations but do so for   the wrong reasons. The goal of this project is to use these uncertainties   themselves as a guide to identifying which types of data are most important to   producing useful projection of future ice sheet change.  The work is focused on two regions, the Aurora basin in East Antarctica, where new high resolution data have recently become available, and the catchment surrounding South Pole station deep in the interior or East Antarctica, where ice flow is currently sluggish may have been faster in the past.    \r\n\r\nBayesian inference may be used to investigate formally the contributions of various model attributes to uncertainty in model projections by synthesizing information from different sources of data, modeling results, and corresponding error information. Here, an ice sheet model will be asked to identify the regions and processes that have the largest influence on ice flow and thickness change, according to an appropriate range of boundary conditions and initial model states. The approach will allow us to create and analyze correlation maps showing relationships between various boundary conditions and model outcome in selected study areas. Those parameters or regions that are most important should dominate the scatter in model projections of change. The associated posterior probability density will provide guidance on how to design observational strategies to meet specified scientific criteria.",

That's a broad topic, so we focused on how processes deep in the interior of Antarctica or Greenland can influence ice flow near the margin. This matters a great deal because modeling focused on the margins of the ice sheets, excluding the deep interior, inform our current estimates of sea-level rise.

In addition to computer modeling, we considered the statistics that result from running the same model with many different inputs, or 'ensemble' modeling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Initially we ran our computational models to find the age of ice. The age of ice was then compared to the internal structure of ice revealed by ice penetrating radar. In this way, we identified the origins of flow features deep in the interior of Antarctica. &nbsp;However, the analysis was not conclusive, and this didn't prove to be as productive as other lines of inquiry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More progress was made thinking about the heat flowing into the base of icesheets. This heat moves from the mantel, through the Earth's crust and into the ice. The heat flow is larger when the crust is thin. The crust can be thinned if it moves over a 'hot spot', or region of intense heat production deeper in the mantel. By running large numbers of computer models and comparing the results to observations of temperature and ice velcoity, we found that it the Greenland ice sheet's tectonic plate traveled over the hot spot that is now under Iceland. This movement over a hot spot thinned the crust and has created a region of high heat flow under Northeast Greenland. The increased heat flow is responsible for the present day motion of ice in the region, which is significantly faster than its surrounds and initiated deep in the interior of the ice sheet.</p>\n<p>Our final finding had to do with the observation that in winter, the pressure of water at the base of ice sheets does not decrease. This observation comes from holes drilled to the base of the Greenland ice sheet with hot water. The holes are fitted with pressure transducers, and after the holes feeze shut, pressures &nbsp;are recorded for a period as long as several years. There are now about 20 such boreholes that relay the same information - pressures are high, close to the weight of ice above, throughout the year.</p>\n<p>These observations challenge our understanding of how sliding relates to basal water pressure.
