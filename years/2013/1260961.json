For example, the owner of a U.S. government bond stands to receive a series of interest payments and a principal repayment in fixed dollar terms. Similarly, U.S. fixed-rate mortgage borrowers owe a series of payments that are fixed in dollar terms as well. The use of money as a unit of account for assets and liabilities matters, because it implies that unanticipated changes in the value of the unit of account (i.e., inflation or deflation) lead to wealth redistribution between borrowers and lenders. For example, unanticipated inflation lowers the real value of all nominal assets and liabilities, implying that lenders lose and borrowers gain.\r\nThe project examines the origins and implications of money's role as a unit of account for assets and liabilities from theoretical and quantitative perspectives. The research has four different components. The first component is theoretical, and aims to explain why economic agents choose to use money as the unit of account for assets and liabilities (as opposed to, say, indexing future payments to inflation). A theory of this kind can also be used to understand the history of the use of money as a unit of account, the role of government debt in promoting the use of money a unified unit of account, and the economics of currency unions. The second component examines the role of redistribution effects for the political economy of inflation, and thereby contributes to a positive theory of inflation. The third component considers the possibility of higher inflation in the United States in the near future, and uses a quantitative general equilibrium model with a rich life-cycle structure to assess the effects of such an inflation shock on macroeconomic aggregates and welfare. The model allows for financial constraints and has an explicit housing market, so that the interaction between inflation and real estate prices can be examined as well. This component of the research will enhance our understanding of the temptation to use inflation to erode government debt, as well as the distributional and macroeconomic implications of such a policy. The last component of the proposed research focuses on the disinflation episode in the United States during the 1980s, and uses panel data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to document the impact of surprise deflation on household wealth. Given that individual mortgage histories can be constructed for households in the SCF panel, this research will provide insights into the impact of stabilization policies at the level of individual households, and enhance our understanding of the wider macroeconomic effects of such policies.\r\nIn sum, the project deepens our understanding of monetary policy and its consequences, as well as the design of monetary institutions and currency systems. The implications for optimal currency areas will help clarify the costs and benefits of a unified currency, an issue which recently has received a lot of attention due to the debt crisis in the Euro zone. The political-economy aspect of the proposal will help clarify the feedback between institutional features of an economy such as the design of the pension system and monetary policy.",

If inflation is high and hence money loses its value quickly, all assets and liabilities whose value is fixed in terms of money (dollars in the United States) lose real value also, implying that nominal (i.e., money-denominated) borrowers win, whereas nominal lenders lose from inflation. These effects are especially pronounced when inflation rates get high. One major policy concern about high inflation is that savers lose money; indeed, historically many savers have lost most of their wealth in phases of hyperinflation. Conversely, in phases of high inflation there are also winners, namely households or businesses who took out nominal loans to buy real assets. One example are U.S. households who bought houses in the late 1960s and early 1970s and financed them with long-term fixed rate mortgages. Such households experienced substantial appreciation of the value of their houses together with a devaluing of the real value of their debt during the 1970s inflation episode, leaving them richer in the process.<br /> <br /> This research project examines the economic mechanisms that give rise to the use of money as a unit of account, and quantifies the redistributional effects of monetary policy in the U.S. economy. The first question to be answered is why so many contracts (such as loans, deposits, bonds, mortgages) specify nominal (dollar) payments, rather than indexing payments to inflation to avoid inflation exposure. The research develops a theoretical model that explains how exposure to balance sheet risk in an economy characterized by credit chains and non-synchronous matching with business partners can give rise to a dominant unit of account in an economy. To explain why money is used as the dominant unit of account, it turns out to be important to account for nominal government debt: if governments borrow a lot in the local currency, this leads to balance sheet exposures in terms of money, which in turn makes money a focal point for private contracts as well.

Within the household sector, the research shows that middle-age, middle-class households with high mortgage debt have the most to gain from inflation, whereas potential losses from inflation are concentrated among richer and older households. A quantitative modeling exercise shows that this distribution gives rise to substantial aggregate effects of inflation through the redistribution channel, because winners and losers from inflation react differently to wealth shocks.
