 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research employs an ethnographic method to analyze motivations for individuals? participation in small-scale fisheries. The majority of fisheries in Iceland are managed under a nationwide privatized program where access to the right to fish is limited, and these limitations can negatively impact small-scale fishing operations. This project aims to better understand the opportunities and constraints that varying management schemes have on the cultural dimensions of small-scale fisheries. The economic literature that fisheries privatization is based upon assumes the primary motivation for fishing to be profit maximization. However, research from around the world suggests that a wide range of motivations for engagement in fisheries exists outside profit generation. This research compares individuals engaged in non-privatized small-boat fisheries with those participating in the small-boat privatized fisheries in a two-phase design that uses methods of semi-directed interviewing and the deployment of a questionnaire to gather qualitative and quantitative data. Results will add to new knowledge exploring the effects that the privatization of marine resources has on individuals? abilities to access marine resources. This research will also bring a new perspective to fisheries management in Iceland and abroad by providing a better understanding of the variations of motivations in fisheries and exploring the ways political and social institutions affect how humans organize around resources.",

ITQs are a percentage of a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of a certain fish species that fishermen buy and sell depending on the market price. This system is effective in an economic sense because it makes fisheries overall more valuable &ndash; those who cannot afford to keep the quota sell it, and those who run efficient fishing operations buy quota to maintain or grow their fishing business. The problem with the ITQ system in Iceland was that it disproportionately impacted small-boat fishermen and rural communities. Fishing businesses were too small to cover the rising cost of quota, so fishermen lost jobs, the associated fish processing plants closed down, and whole communities began to die. These negative impacts continue to be a major political issue in Iceland, which is why a new non-ITQ summer fishery was started in 2009.
