 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The cyanobacteria are unique organisms that can grow using CO2 as a carbon source in the presence of sunlight. These organisms have the potential to combat global warming by utilizing CO2 while providing the economy with useful fuels and commodity chemicals. In order to achieve this goal, more must be learned about the basic metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria. These organisms can grow both in the presence of light (day-time \"autotrophic\" growth) where they synthesize excess sugars for continued growth in the dark (night-time \"heterotrophic\" growth). Understanding both metabolic programs is essential for ultimately engineering the cyanobacteria to convert CO2 into fuels and chemicals such as: ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, alkane biofuels, and eventually any of the commodity chemicals currently obtained from a barrel of oil. The cyanobacterium considered in this research is Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a common strain for research that is also industrially relevant. This organism will be fed radiolabeled glucose in this research so the molecule can be tracked easily through the metabolic network using a methodology called 13C-labeled metabolic flux analysis (13CMFA). This method is very accurate but also very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to perform. Metabolism will also be studied separately by considering a purely mathematical model of metabolism using an established technique called flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA is very fast and inexpensive, but results do not usually agree with the 13C-MFA method. This research will develop a method to reconcile 13CMFA and FBA. The hypothesis to be explored is that an accurate portrayal of cell composition (e.g., correct amounts of protein, DNA, RNA, cell wall, lipids, etc.) is needed to obtain FBA predictions that are consistent with 13C-MFA measurements. To achieve this, a \"phenotype predictor\" algorithm will be developed and verified with laboratory measurements of cyanobacteria cell composition. The phenotype predictor will require very simple to obtain measurements of the organism and will predict the resulting cell composition along with an accurate portrayal of how metabolites are distributed throughout the metabolic network of the organism.                       \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The \"phenotype predictor\" will allow scientists to rapidly and inexpensively determine very complex characteristics of a growing culture. This method will be used to determine how metabolic engineering the cyanobacteria for fuels and chemicals production ultimately impacts the health of the culture so it can be optimized. The methodology will be extremely useful to researchers working with other organisms used for industrial scale metabolite production. The project will offer excellent cross-disciplinary research training and educational opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCyanobacteria and algae are of significant interest to the biotechnology industry for the sustainable production of food, chemicals, medicines, and biofuels.  These organisms utilize CO2 from the atmosphere, along with sunlight, and efforts are underway to engineer these organisms to better produce molecules of interest.  The process of metabolic engineering involves altering genes and metabolic pathways of an organism so that it over-produces a molecule of interest to an industrially-relevant level.  In the case of cyanobacteria and algae, fatty acids are examples of molecules of interest because they can be converted into biodiesel.  However, altering a gene or metabolic pathway in an organism does not always produce the desired result, and several iterations are often required to generate a strain suitable for industrial production.  For example, engineering cyanobacteria to over-produce fatty acids can lead to \"unhealthy\" strains that do not grow fast enough to be useful in industry.  In addition, implementing genetic manipulations in the laboratory remains slow, taking months or longer, and significant resources are required.  \n\nThis NSF-funded project has addressed this issue by enabling genetic engineering experiments in cyanobacteria (and potentially all other organisms) to be evaluated by computer simulations first.  These \"phenotype prediction\" simulations can be performed in seconds and require minimal resources.  This will allow researchers to evaluate potential genetic manipulation strategies and hypotheses before going through the laborious task of creating and testing strains in the laboratory.  It is designed to streamline the generation of useful engineered cyanobacterial strains while conserving valuable laboratory resources.\n\nWhile building and testing the \"phenotype prediction\" algorithm in this project, several other useful discoveries were made.  First, a novel procedure, called lambda-PCR, was developed for performing genetic manipulations and assembling DNA.  This technique out-performed all commercial products tested, and it significantly reduces the cost and time associated with genetic engineering.  Furthermore, lambda-PCR was used to develop a method of producing more stable cyanobacteria mutant strains.  This will be of significant interest to other academic researchers and the biotechnology industry.  Raman spectroscopy was also implemented and optimized, in this project, as a tool for monitoring cyanobacteria phenotypes.  Raman spectroscopy is a low-cost and portable methodology used to examine phenotypes of living cells.  It is non-destructive and returns information in near real-time.  It was used to monitor cyanobacteria phenotype changes through light/dark cycles and other growth conditions.  Ultimately, this technique can be used in quality control for industrial cultures or to quickly scan engineered strains to select ones with desirable traits, such as fatty acids over-production.\n\nThis project provided technical laboratory and computer programming training to several graduate and undergraduate students at Virginia Tech.  In addition, laboratory modules were setup to provide training to local high school students during the summers of this project.  Finally, educational materials on the basics of metabolic engineering were constructed and presented to over 40 local high school students during each summer of the project.  Feedback from these students was overwhelmingly positive, and several have gone on to pursue college majors related to biotechnology, engineering, and sustainable production of foods, chemicals, medicines, and biofuels.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ryan S Senger"
