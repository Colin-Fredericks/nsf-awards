 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a coastal state, Delaware is facing the prospect of sea-level rise and its consequences for natural and built landscapes ranging from tidal wetlands to agricultural land to densely populated and polluted urban areas.  Accordingly, this project addresses water and energy sustainability issues through four interdisciplinary research themes that integrate engineering and the social and natural sciences: the effect of sea-level rise on contaminant mobility and cycling; coupled land use and climate change impacts on water and natural systems; development and deployment of environmental sensors that provide data for the other themes and assist in environmental monitoring and forecasting systems; and innovations in environmentally sound renewable energy sources.\r\n\r\nThe University of Delaware (UD), Delaware State University, Wesley College, and Delaware Technical Community College will collaboratively address these themes using innovative research approaches and educational programs.  The project includes public outreach activities and partnerships with private industry and government.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is interdisciplinary with a focus on factors affecting water quality in a coastal zone subject to land use, demographic, and climate changes.  Novel approaches will be used to investigate the fate of soil-bound contaminants inundated by sea-level rise, new environmental sensor technologies will be developed, and economic, sociological, ethical, and policy research will be integrated within each of the research themes.  The project will address renewable energy including wind and biofuels.  Novel means of securing the economic and societal benefits of the research through intellectual property development, education, and outreach, in the context of workforce development, are proposed.  A seed grant program will capitalize on new opportunities and expand the network of investigators.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of the changes likely to occur in coastal areas and the range of possible human responses to those changes will have direct and near-term application in the state of Delaware, as well as widespread applicability around the nation and the globe.  The research is planned so that results will inform public policy and decision making through collaboration and outreach.  Student participants will be trained in interdisciplinary research approaches that integrate the natural and social sciences, as well as bridge the academic, public, and private sectors.  New degree programs, internships with public and private partners, outreach visits, training in communication and intellectual property, and initiatives to integrate education and research combine to provide innovative opportunities for training the next generation of scientists and engineers.",

Investments in faculty and equipment resulted in over 308 peer-reviewed publications and $31 million in new awards. This project allowed for hiring of five new tenure-track faculty members (80% retention rate). Research in these areas informed state policy and contributed to the economic prosperity of the state and region. The project supported 383 faculty, 205 Technical and Non-technical staff. 51 post-docs, 166 graduate students and 597 undergraduates, and reached more than 6,000 citizens throughout the state. Faculty members obtained grants from NSF, NIH, USDA, and DOE. Students received four NSF GRFP awards. Since 2014, the project supported 18 Delaware Environmental Fellows and new collaborations and student exchanges with HBCUs resulted in training of 6 students and one undegraduate attending UD as graduate student. A new core facility, the Advanced Materials Characterization Lab, was launched and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, including a NANO-IR (the only one in the country in an academic setting), XRD, XRF and ICPMS-LA. The facility saw a fourfold increase in registered users (125 in 2014 to 957 in 2018) and greatly enhanced the training of graduate and postgraduate students.
