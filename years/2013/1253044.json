 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pulsed lasers have played a central role in a large number of applications ranging from fundamental scientific studies to industry. In the coming decades, pulsed lasers \"in the form of optical frequency combs\" will help unravel current mysteries in science, such as dark energy or the potential time-dependence of fundamental constants. But many of these experiments are now approaching the limits of existing tools. Continued progress in these fields will require new approaches. This project will deliver a new framework for understanding the quantum and classical noise limitations in pulsed laser sources and demonstrate novel interdisciplinary approaches towards creating a new kind of pulsed laser that will serve as the next generation of optical precision tools.\r\n\r\nThis project will lead to robust pulsed lasers with record-low noise performance, which will have a strong impact on science and technology. In astronomy, they will aid programs such as the dark energy search through the calibration of astronomical telescopes. In basic physics, they will serve as new precision tools for atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The project will also serve the scientific community by training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups through an extensive set of outreach activities and diverse recruitment efforts. Finally, impact on society will occur notably through novel medical diagnostics, environmental sensing, and high-speed optical telecommunication systems.",
