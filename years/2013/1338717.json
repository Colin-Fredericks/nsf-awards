This committee represents the U.S. community of researchers and scientists with interest in mechanics. It thereby represents 15 professional societies. The committee has both international as well as domestic agendas. With this award the committee will fulfills the member country obligations to the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) through paying membership dues, and sending a U.S. to the Union's General Assembly to represent U.S. interests. Furthermore, this awards supports the domestic efforts of the committee by enabling adminsitrative support as well as the annual meeting of the national committee.\r\n\r\nThrough the work of the U.S. National Committee on Technical and Applied Mechanics the U.S. research community is represented in general matters of the International Union on Technical and Applied Mechanics, its leadership structure, the organization of the International Congress of Technical and Applied Mechanics, and the organization and award of IUTAM technical symposia, and of IUTAM summer schools. These events serve as important catalysts in research. The committee also facilitates informal international cooperation and discussion on the subject matter of the committee. Domestically, the committee represents and engages with the mechanics community. With this award the annual meeting of the committee is enabled. The committee oversees the organization of the U.S. Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and has initiated the AMERIMECH symposium series. Ultimately, the work of the committee in its role of leadership internationally and nationally, leads to a contribution to scientific diplomacy in the subject area of technical and applied mechanics.",

It also represents the United States in the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM).\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) obtained a one-year grant for Advancing U.S. National and International Interests in the Field of Mechanics through the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM), grant number 1338717.  The two goals of this project were: 1)\nfulfill the member country obligations to the IUTAM, which included paying\ndues, sending a U.S. delegation to IUTAM General Assembly, nominating\nindividuals for leadership positions and committees, providing guidance on\nprograms and activities, and organizing activities for U.S. scientists, and 2)\npromote the field of mechanics nationally by convening a National Congress and implementing a range of activities including symposia and technical reports.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe involvement of USNC/TAM members in the planning and organization of its various national and international activities advance the field of mechanics in the U.S. and abroad. The activities this committee has held under this grant have continued to expand the body of knowledge in the field. The USNC/TAM helped organize the following activities: the 17th U.S. National Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics held in June 15-20, 2014 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan; the AmeriMech Symposia Series where interactions among researchers in areas of contemporary interest in the mechanics of fluids and solids are promoted; and the series of periodic reports called Recent Trends in Mechanics. \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe five-member U.S. delegation achieved the following results at the 2014 IUTAM General Assembly.  Sixteen new IUTAM Symposia were approved for the 2016-17 period, including two from the United States.  Chairs and Co-Chairs were selected for 44 Thematic Sessions (mini-symposia on current technical subjects).  Of these, U.S. scientists were selected to co-chair 30 sessions.  Seven U.S. members were appointed to the IUTAM Congress Committee through 2016.  Sixteen Sectional Lecturers were selected out of 87, and eight of these are from the U.S.\n\nThe National Congress at Michigan State University (MSU) had 912 participants, 17 parallel sessions of 15 minutes each, and total of 197 sessions.  The National Congresses are very well attended by students, who participate and share their work with researchers and senior experts while building their own networks with peers and more established scientists. \n\nThree reports on Recent Trends in Mechanics were published.  The reports cover a variety of topics, from medicine to energy, and all reports are freely available for download in the USNC/TAM website.  The recent reports\ninclude The USNC/TAM Perspectives on Mechanics in Medicine, which has been downloaded 12,191 times; The Research Directions in Experimental\nSolid Mechanics at Small Scales; and The U.S. Energy and Environmental Challenges and Fundamental Contributions from Mechanics Research. \n\nFinally, three AmeriMech symposia were held in 2014:  Dynamics of Metamaterials, which included 19 talks, 3 student posters, and a total of 50 participants; Mechanics in Biology, which had 9 invited talks (4 junior, 5 senior), and 42 participants (25 graduate students, and 9 junior faculty); and Internal Waves in Fluids, which had 39 oral presentations (6 invited), 19 posters, and 74 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ana M Ferreras"
