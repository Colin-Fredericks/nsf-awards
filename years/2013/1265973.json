 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study complex symmetric operators and truncated Toeplitz operators, aiming to clarify the intriguing relationship between these two interrelated classes of Hilbert space operators.  Complex symmetric operators are a broad class of operators that has not been adequately studied in generality until recently.  The study of truncated Toeplitz operators, a rapidly growing branch of function-theoretic operator theory, has undergone spirited development stemming from a seminal 2007 paper of Sarason.  A recent series of articles by the principal investigator and his growing list of collaborators have unearthed surprising links between these two classes.  Research on this subject has the potential to be transformative, having relevance to a number of fields.  For instance, connections to function theory and matrix analysis have already engaged researchers from both large institutions and small colleges.  Moreover, the study of complex symmetric and truncated Toeplitz operators has already proven to be fertile ground for undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nThe study of linear operators on Hilbert space has its modern roots in the seminal work of von Neumann, who in the early twentieth century developed a rigorous framework in which to describe quantum mechanics.  Since then, operator theory has found applications in electrical engineering, quantum physics, image processing, and statistics, to name a few areas outside of pure mathematics.  This project will study two novel, but surprisingly ubiquitous, classes of operators, while also considering several specific questions that interface with other researchers in the mathematical sciences.  To do this, the principal investigator will collaborate with colleagues old and new, as well as sponsor undergraduate research.  Indeed, many questions stemming from this project are suitable for undergraduate research and the principal investigator will recruit a diverse array of students to work on them.  These students will be equipped with the skills, expertise, confidence, and passion necessary to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.  This project will create not only new mathematics, but also the new mathematicians necessary to enhance and enrich the nation's infrastructure for research and education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI studied problems in operator theory (best thought of as infinite-dimensional linear algebra of the sort necessary for quantum mechanics) and in related areas (e.g., matrix analysis).  Under this grant, the PI coauthored almost two dozen papers and several books.  He also mentored dozens of students, some of whom are from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.\n\nAn exciting outgrowth of this research was the establishment of a new research group (publishing 6-7 articles) consisting of mathematicians from the US and Europe that focused on connections between operator theory (asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants), discrete geometry (lattices and their geometric properties), and algebraic geometry (function fields).  This produced a new line of research that led to publications in many different venues (e.g., operator theory journals, applied math journals, pure algebra journals).  The PI expects to submit a proposal on this promising research in the near future.\n\nAnother exciting direction that emerged from this work was the application of \"supercharacter theory\" (a relatively new technique in the field of combinatorial representation theory) to certain exponential sums of interest in analytic number theory.  The motivation for the PI, however, came from signal processing, Fourier analysis, and complex variables.  This work resulted in a paper (\"Gauss' hidden menagerie: from cyclotomy to supercharacters\") that was featured in the prestigious Notices of the AMS.  It was coauthored with two graduate students.  This is an example of the \"nimbleness\" of the PI, who often surges into new and unexpected territory when novel opportunities emerge.\n\nThe PI also wrote several articles addressing the pedagogy of complex analysis.  During the grant period, the PI emerged as a leading voice in the discussion, having written several articles on the topic and given talks at several meetings.\n\nTo ensure wider dissemination of recent work, the PI wrote several survey articles and books with top publishers, such as Cambridge, Springer, and the AMS.  For example, \"Introduction to model spaces and their operators\" (Cambridge, 2016) covers many recent advances in the subject, some of which were due to the author and his collaborators.  The book \"Finite Blaschke products and their connections\" (under contract with Springer) is nearly complete.  The PI also wrote (with Roger Horn) a textbook for a second course in linear algebra (published by Cambridge) which taks a block-matrix based approach to the subject, which is amenable to statistics, computer science, and data analysis, as well as pure and applied mathematics.\n\nThe PI mentored many students, both undergraduate and graduate.  Many of these students coauthored publications with the PI that appeared in leading journals.  Several of students mentored under this grant are now attending top graduate programs in the mathematical sciences (e.g., Berkeley, Stanford, UCSD, UCLA, Michigan).  In particular, this includes several female students, one of whom earn the prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephan R Garcia"
