 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid development of large-scale data collection technology has\r\nignited research into high-dimensional machine learning.  For\r\ninstance, the problem of designing recommender systems, such as those\r\nused by Amazon, Netflix and other on-line companies, involves\r\nanalyzing large matrices that describe users' behavior in past\r\nsituations.  In sociology, researchers are interested in fitting\r\nnetworks to large-scale data sets, involving hundreds or thousands of\r\nindividuals.  In medical imaging, the goal is to reconstruct\r\ncomplicated phenomena (e.g., brain images; videos of a beating heart)\r\nbased on on a minimal number of incomplete and possibly corrupted\r\nmeasurements.  Motivated by such applications, the goal of this\r\nresearch is to develop and analyze models and algorithms for\r\nextracting relevant structure from such high-dimensional data sets in\r\na robust and scalable fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research leverages tools from convex optimization, signal\r\nprocessing, and robust statistics.  It consists of three main thrusts:\r\n(1) Model restrictiveness: Successful methods for high-dimensional\r\ndata exploit low-dimensional structure; however, many real-world\r\nproblems fall outside the scope of existing models.  This proposal\r\nsignificantly extends the basic set-up by allowing for multiple\r\nstructures, leading to computationally efficient algorithms while\r\neliminating negative effects of model mismatch.  (2) Non-ideal data:\r\nMissing data are prevalent in real-world problems, and can cause major\r\nbreakdowns in standard algorithms for high-dimensional data. The\r\nsecond thrust devises relaxations and greedy approaches for these\r\nnon-convex problems.  (3) Arbitrary Outliers: Gross errors can arise\r\nfor various reasons, including fault-prone sensors and manipulative\r\nagents.  The third thrust proposes efficient and randomized algorithms\r\nto address arbitrary outliers.",
