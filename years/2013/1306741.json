 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Colorado State University is to study novel biomaterial tissue constructs that will be able to mimic the native interface between soft tissue and bone. This award is cofunded by the Biomedical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. The Global Venture Fund program in the Office of International Science and Engineering is also supporting this project. Although numerous soft-tissue replacement constructs have been developed previously, less attention has been dedicated in recreating the interface between the engineered replacement soft-tissue and the hard bone. The proposed tissue construct will be prepared from a composite hydrogel reinforced with polycaprolactone nanofibers, and seeded by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In order to mimic the structure of native soft tissue-to-bone interface, biochemical and biophysical cues will be modulated along the length of the tissue construct to drive the differentiation of MSCs down the chondrogenic, fibrocartilaginous, and ligamentous pathways. With this design of the tissue graft, the end part of the bone tissue will be established by promoting endochondral ossification of the chondrogenically primed portion of the construct following in vivo implantation of stem cells. This approach is unique and innovative in providing a spatially graded engineered tissue grafts with the capacity to promote the formation of an intermediary soft tissue template, which will differentiate into appropriate end-stage tissue phenotypes in response to local environmental cues. This strategy is to recapitulate different aspects of the developmental process, where all tissues are derived from soft tissue precursors and specific environmental cues are critical to determining end-stage differentiation. With respect to educational and training aspects of the project, this work will involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a broad range of innovative tissue engineering and biomaterial design techniques. Student exchanges with Ireland and Northern Ireland are also parts of this project.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together experts from the US, Ireland and Northern Ireland to address a growing problem related to knee injuries using a combined approach that incorporates materials research, engineering, cell biology and biomaterials. Although numerous replacements for injured soft tissue structures have been developed, these techniques typically fail to address the soft tissue-to-bone interface. This interface is necessary for the proper functionality of the entire joint. This project seeks to recreate the interface between soft tissue and bone using a novel biomaterial construct that mimics the structure and function of the native interface. In addition to innovative research, this grant will use outreach activities to emphasize the education of students and the general public. Graduate students and undergraduate students who participate in this research will learn both biological and engineering techniques and will have opportunities to attend conferences to disseminate research and strengthen international collaborations. This work will also provide engineering experience to pre-college students in encouraging their participation in research. Additionally, this project will interact with local Native American communities to encourage their members to participate in science subjects. During National Engineers Week, Girl Scout groups will be involved in lab demonstrations in encouraging younger girls to become interested in science and engineering. Finally, the research will be disseminated to the general public by publishing results in nationally recognized journals.",

We have shown that these nanofiberbundles support cell proliferation and elongation and the hierarchicalstructure and material properties are similar to the native human ACL. It ispossible to combine multiple nanofiber bundles to create a scaffold that attempts to mimic the macro-scale structure of the ACL. The goal of this work was to develop a hierarchical bioactive scaffold for ligament tissueengineering using connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) conjugatednanofiber bundles and evaluate the behavior of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) on these scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. The conjugation efficiency and the release ofconjugated CTGF was assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,assays, and immunofluorescence staining. Scaffolds were seeded withMSCs and maintained in vitro for 7 days (individual nanofiber bundles), invitro for 21 days (scaled-up scaffolds of 20 nanofiber bundles) or in vivofor 6 weeks (small scaffolds of 4 nanofiber bundles) and ligament specifictissue formation was assessed in comparison to non-CTGF conjugatedcontrol scaffolds. Results showed that CTGF conjugation encouraged cellproliferation and ligament specific tissue formation in vitro and in vivo. Theresults suggest that hierarchical electrospun nanofiber bundles conjugatedwith CTGF are a scalable and bioactive scaffold for ACL tissue engineering.</p>\n<p>The goal of this work was to modify nanofiber sheets to create a robust structure that mimics the complex hierarchy of native tendons and ligaments. The scaffolds that were fabricated in this study consisted of either random or aligned nanofibers in flat sheets or rolled nanofiber bundles that mimic the size scale of fascicle units in primary tensile bearing soft musculoskeletal tissues. Altering nanofiber orientation and geometry significantly affected mechanical properties; most notably aligned nanofiber sheets had the greatest modulus; 125% higher than that of random nanofiber sheets; and 45% higher than aligned nanofiber bundles. Modifying aligned nanofiber sheets to form aligned nanofiber bundles also resulted in approximately 107% higher yield stresses and 140% higher yield strains. The mechanical properties of aligned nanofiber bundles were in the range of the mechanical properties of the native ACL: modulus = 158 &plusmn; 32 MPa, yield stress = 57 &plusmn; 23 MPa and yield strain = 0.38 &plusmn; 0.08. Adipose derived stem cells cultured on all surfaces remained viable and proliferated extensively over a 7 day culture period and cells elongated on nanofiber bundles. The results of the study suggest that aligned nanofiber bundles may be useful for ligament and tendon tissue engineering based on their mechanical properties and ability to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and elongation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of the electrospun scaffold as an ACL replacement. Scaffold mechanical properties were assessed prior to implantation via stress relaxation and pull to failure testing. Following <em>in vitro </em>characterization, electrospun scaffolds and soft tissue grafts were implanted into ovine cadaver stifle joints as ACL replacements. Stifle joints with ACL replacements were tested via a simulated anterior drawer test as well as <em>in situ</em> stress relaxation and pull to failure tests and compared to stifle joints with the native ACL intact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to implantation the scaffold matched the native ovine ACL well in the range of functional strains as evidenced by stress relaxation measures and the toe region stiffness.

Drawbacks to traditional ACL repair techniques motivate the development of a tissue engineered ACL scaffold. The goal of this study was to compare ovine cadaver tibiofemoral contact mechanics after ACL reconstruction with the electrospun scaffold to that of a clinically applicable ACL reconstruction with a soft tissue graft. After ACL reconstruction with either the electrospun scaffold or soft tissue graft, Tekscan thin film pressure sensors were inserted under the menisci and used to measure contact area and mean and peak contact pressure. Loads up to 1778 N were applied at flexion angles of 45&deg;, 60&deg;, and 75&deg; to mimic loads and angles observed during ovine gait.&nbsp; Contact mechanics after implantation of the electrospun scaffold were not significantly different from contact mechanics after implantation of the soft tissue graft at all applied loads and flexion angles. Additionally, at low loads scaffold implantation was able to normalize medial mean contact pressures relative to the ACL-deficient knee.
