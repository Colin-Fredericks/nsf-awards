We set out to develop, evaluate, and refine undergraduate science and mathematical modules for labs and classes based on applications of tree rings to age dating, climate and environmental change, volcanic hazards, statistical modeling, and forensic science.</p>\n<p>Serious studies of tree rings (dendrochronology) began in the early 1900s when astronomer Andrew Douglass was seeking a way to measure the effect of the sun on climate in the American Southwest. Douglass found recognizable patterns in tree-ring growth that he could relate to climate phenomena, such as the amount of precipitation in an area, and that could be recognized over broad areas. By 1929 he was able to use a regional chronology of tree rings that he had developed from old trees to date timbers from archaeological sites that had been inhabited by the ancient Puebloan peoples of the American Southwest during the 13<sup>th</sup> century and extending back more than five centuries&mdash;His work pre-dated the development of radiocarbon dating in 1947 and revolutionized the study of prehistory, for the first time allowing dating of past events to the year. This breakthrough and subsequent development of tree-ring laboratories, analysis and measurement equipment and techniques, and statistical methods for evaluating tree ring measurements has made tree-ring science invaluable for studying not only past climate, environmental, and geologic history, but also for evaluating and dating modern landscape processes such landslide movement as well as for aiding in the radiocarbon dating of ancient &ldquo;subfossil&rdquo; trees or wood structures.</p>\n<p>We have incorporated interactive multi-media modules via an outside website and have provided &nbsp;background material on the history and importance of the topics in the modules. We have also prepared guidelines to allow instructors flexibility in the adoption of the modules.

In this lab students learn about the ancient Puebloan culture and analyze a scan of a historic timber from Pueblo Bonito ruin at Chaco Canyon using a traditional method of analysis invented by Douglass, skeleton plotting, on a segment of the sample. They then try to match their skeleton plot with one done on the sample by a scientist from the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research in 1971. Students then measure the rings of the same segment, plot their measurements using Excel other spreadsheet software, and then match the time series plot they have created with a skeleton plot. In one exercise they normalized or detrend their measurements using Excel in order to remove the biological growth curve and create dimensionless indices that can be compared more easily with data from other tree-ring chronologies such as an extensive one from El Malpais National Monument, not far from Chaco Canyon. Students who completed these lab exercises gained insights into the historical aspects of the ancient Puebloans, learned about the materials they used for their buildings, gained experience using tree-ring techniques to measure wood samples, and also analyzed the data they created to crossdate or match samples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patrick&nbsp;Pringle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423109698_TREX_coverpage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423109698_TREX_coverpage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cover page for TREX Lab 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423109698_TREX_coverpage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cover page for TREX Lab 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of the cover page for tree-ring lab module 2 in which students investigate a historic pilaster used to create a dwelling, Pueblo Bonito, used by the ancient Puebloan peoples.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TREX Tree-ring Expeditions</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Patrick&nbsp;Pringle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cover page for TREX Lab 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423523417_JacobP_skelplot_proj_JPB31_1332-sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423523417_JacobP_skelplot_proj_JPB31_1332-sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student evaluating the tree rings of a historic pillaster at Pueblo Bonito ruin at Chaco Canyon in order to create a skeleton plot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1248102/1248102_10274007_1483423523417_JacobP_skelplot_proj_JPB31_1332-sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student evaluating the tree rings of a historic pillaster at Pueblo Bonito ruin at Chaco Canyon in order to create a skeleton plot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student evaluating the tree rings of a projected high-resolution scanned image of polished slab from a historic pillaster at Pueblo Bonito ruin at Chaco Canyon.
