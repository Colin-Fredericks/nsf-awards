 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eleventh annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held April 6-April 7, 2013, at the University of Notre Dame. The conference includes a geographically diverse group of over 100 graduate students at various stages of their careers. There is a broad range of talks in the schedule: 24 graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology; two plenary speakers, Dan Freed (UT Austin) and Burkhard Wilking (M\u00fcnster); and six invited young faculty speakers, David Ayala (Harvard), Clark Barwick (MIT), Alessio Figalli (UT Austin), Fernando Galaz-Garc\u00eda (M\u00fcnster), Ana Rita Pires (Cornell) and G\u00e1bor Sz\u00e9kelyhidi (Notre Dame). This conference will include a wide range of topics in topology and geometry: hyperbolic geometry, geometry of positive curvature, global analysis, 3-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory, cobordism theory, category theory, Teichm\u007fuller theory, 4-manifolds, dfferential topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.\r\n\r\nThis conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians from different geographic regions. Participants include graduate students at all stages of their careers. This is one of the few conferences in topology and geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Student participants at this conference have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research and to hone their communication and networking skills. Geometry and topology are fundamental mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. This conference serves to foster research and communication about research in these areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these fields. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found at http://www.nd.edu/~conf/gstgc13",
