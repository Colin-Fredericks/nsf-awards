 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description:  Although GaN is effectively used in lighting applications, some electronic devices require high resistivity material.  The goal of this GOALI project is to investigate and understand charge transfer mechanisms among the defects used to achieve insulating GaN and to assess the influence of the intentional impurities on crystal quality. Specifically, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to probe charge transfer between the intentionally added Fe impurities and intrinsic donors. The EPR measurements provide a fingerprint of the Fe and donor defects, and, combined with photo-excitation, are used to monitor various charge exchange processes. Additionally, several different charge states of the Fe impurity as well as other potential defect centers are probed with optical absorption spectroscopy, and overall crystal quality is assessed with x-ray diffraction. The experiments primarily address bulk Fe-doped substrates grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy at Kyma Technologies, the industrial collaborator of this project. However, additional studies include comparisons with samples grown by other growth techniques, such as high pressure solution, and doped with different compensating impurities so that optimal growth parameters for stable insulating nitride substrates may be determined.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: The insights gained by directly probing defects in GaN provide input for improved growth techniques, so that high-quality, high-resistivity material needed for future power electronics can be realized. By interacting with the industrial collaborators, students gain a view of science not available in a classroom setting. Furthermore, a summer research experience with Kyma is being offered to one of the graduate students working on this research, and at least one seminar by a Kyma scientist is planned. Both are intended to introduce students to the practical issues associated with material growth and device development. At the pre-college level, the PI gives an afternoon presentation on colloquial topics related to GaN devices at the week-long high-school Physics Bridge workshop organized by a colleague in the department.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGOALI:  Charge Transfer in Semi-insulating GaN\n\nAward No.: 1308446\n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWe have been studying impurities in GaN, the material well known for creating the \"white light revolution\" where LED?s, rather than incandescent bulbs, provide illumination.  However, GaN has another important role:  to create power.  To achieve high power in electrical circuits using GaN the semiconductor material must be made highly resistive.  Furthermore, the structural quality must be competitive with materials traditionally used for circuits, like silicon and gallium arsenide.  Two challenges must be overcome to achieve this: impurities must be added and the semiconductor must be able to be grown as mm-thick free-standing platelets.  We have studied GaN doped with three different types of impurities, Iron (Fe), Beryllium (Be), and Magnesium (Mg), in substrates grown two different ways.\n\nWe have shown that Fe, the most commonly used impurity for creating high resistivity GaN, has a large ionization energy, and this is partially responsible for the insulating properties of Fe-doped GaN.   However, our studies also showed that adding Fe to GaN is not a very efficient way to make resistive material.  Sometimes unwanted defects called neutral donors, which make the material conducting, remain in the crystal.  We believe this is due to segregation, where the Fe and the neutral donors are physically separated and cannot ?cancel? each other electrically as would be necessary to achieve the desired resistance.\n\nBe is less commonly used for the growth of highly resistive GaN due to the high toxicity and limited abundance.  Nevertheless, several investigations show that the Be is effective at blocking unwanted currents in devices specially made for high power generation.  We have found that Be can act as a very efficient ?current block? because it can capture free charge that creates the current and hold onto it up to very high temperatures.  The stability at high temperature is a very important property because a device that creates a lot of power will also get very hot.  The property which demonstrates the ability to ?hold on to? trapped charge is the ionization energy which we have shown to be ~0.8 eV, an energy well above room temperature thermal energy.\n\nMg is typically used to achieve \"p-type\" GaN that is necessary for making LEDs; however, the impurity also creates highly resistive material.   Unlike the dopants discussed above, Mg is not usually grown into thick free-standing substrates since LEDs require only high quality micron-thick films.  Therefore, most of our study concentrated on determining how much Mg could be incorporated without significantly deteriorating the material quality.  Our results show that GaN substrates could contain up to 1018 cm-3 Mg, which is sufficient to create insulating behavior, without destroying the integrity of the crystal.\n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nA critical factor in the success of this project was the direct interaction with two major collaborators: our NSF GOALI partner in the US, Kyma Technologies, and our international collaborators at the Institute of High Pressure Physics, Warsaw Poland.  Both the PI and students communicated with the industrial scientists to develop the appropriate samples for experimentation and discuss factors influencing the results.   In addition to the industrial collaborators, we also worked with scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  As a highlight, one of the graduate students supported by the program participated in the Naval Research Enterprise Internship Program to work with collaborators at NRL.  The experience broadened the student?s view of the material he is studying by exposing him to device applications and different types of electronic measurements.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary Ellen Zvanut"
