By enabling the execution of systematic literature reviews, this infrastructure helps ensure that researchers identify a complete and unbiased set of candidate papers when performing such a review. In addition, this project lowers the barrier for performing SLRs allowing a larger portion of the SE community to conduct SLRs. This work is especially helpful for PhD students who much perform a literature review as part of their thesis work. Because SLRs are often publishable as stand-alone articles, this infrastructure will also help increase students? publication rate.\r\n\r\nThis project conducts planning activities in preparation for the creation of an infrastructure to support the SLR process. The community targeted by this project comprises SE researchers who already conduct SLRs, as well as SE researchers who will be more likely to conduct SLRs if the barriers to adoption are removed. The primary objectives of this are to: evolve an understanding of community needs and the proposed infrastructure; and create a detailed plan for the development and deployment of the infrastructure",

The researcher can then analyze all of this information to provide a comprehensive understanding to inform research and practice. SLR is a useful practice in many disciplines including Evidence-Based Medicine. \n\n \nRecently the Software Engineering (SE) discipline has adopted the SLR practice into our methodology toolbox.

The important requirements, grouped by phase, include:\n\n\nProject Initiation and Management\n\n\nAssistance with developing research questions and a detailed protocol\n\n\nValidation of protocol\n\n\nData interchange (i.e. allowing multiple tools to exchange data in a common format)\n\n\n\n\nSearch - i.e. searching databases to identify potentially relevant papers\n\n\nFederated search of multiple paper repositories\n\n\nSupport for query/keyword construction\n\n\nAutomated download of articles\n\n\nSupport for collaboration\n\n\n\n\nSelection - i.e. choosing the right papers from the results of the search process\n\n\nSupport for performing selection based on inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\n\nSupport for collaboration in resolving conflict with study selection\n\n\nCollection, storage, analysis, reporting, and exporting of study results and bibliographic information\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation - i.e. recording and tracking important information about the SLR\n\n\nDocument the planned and executed protocols\n\n\nKeep track of meta-information about included studies\n\n\nRecord conclusions and findings of the SLR\n\n\n\n\nQuality Assurance - i.e. ensuring that the studies included in the SLR are of high-quality\n\n\nSupport for developing a quality assurance plan, including reuse of existing plans\n\n\nMetrics for qualitative and quantitative analysis\n\n\nComparing results from multiple reviewers and resolving discrepancies\n\n\n\n\nData Extraction - i.e. extracting important information from each reviewed study\n\n\nAutomated extraction of evidence\n\n\nCoding of data\n\n\nCollaboration of multiple authors to support conflict resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of this work have established a starting point upon which a SLR support infrastructure can be built. We have detailed descriptions of all of the requirements listed above. We have also begun implementing prototypes for some of the required functionality. Researchers who are interested in building tools to support the SLR process can also make use of our results to guide their efforts. Finally, because many other disciplines, like Evidence Based Medicine, also conduct SLR (and, interestingly, have some of the same problems), the resulting infrastructure can also be of use beyond the discipline of SE.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey C Carver"
