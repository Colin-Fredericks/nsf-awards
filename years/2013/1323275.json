 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project is examining the remote operation of analytical instruments, specifically a scanning-electron microscope and electron microprobe analyzer housed at Florida International University (FIU), to facilitate inquiry-based approaches to learning in undergraduate geoscience courses. The effectiveness of remote instrument use is being assessed across different course levels and audiences at four diverse institutions: FIU, Valencia Community College, Florida Gulf Coast University, and the University of South Florida. Faculty at each institution are adapting instrument use to their courses and students, and using common methods to assess learning gains and changes in students' attitudes along a novice-to-expert trajectory. Instrument use and learning assessment at the four partnering institutions is being supplemented by national-level outreach to engage further partners, using hands-on workshops and follow-on individual training and consultation for faculty who commit to pilot use in their own courses.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in its well-formulated plan to leverage fixed-location, high-end analytical instruments to enable authentic research and inquiry within the undergraduate curriculum at remote institutions. The embedded educational research addresses important questions of a) how much and what type(s) of remote instrument-aided inquiry enable targeted student-learning outcomes, b) what factors determine effectiveness as institution type, curricular level, and student audiences vary, and c) what challenges exist for widespread propagation of the approach and how might these be overcome. Broader impacts of the project include a) the production of insights and practices that promote remote use of research-grade analytical instrumentation at multiple levels of the undergraduate curriculum, providing a model that could be used at other research centers to enable heretofore inaccessible analytical capabilities at a wide range of undergraduate institutions, b) engagement of a diverse range of students (from seniors in majors' classes to first-year non-majors in introductory classes) and institutions (from research universities to community colleges) in authentic research, a high-impact practice for retaining students in STEM disciplines, and c) professional development for faculty at the partnering institutions and beyond, as well as for a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student engaged in discipline-based educational research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sought to expand the application of a promising educational strategy, piloted at the University of South Florida (USF) - the classroom use of remotely operable research microbeam instrumentation (specifically: a scanning electron microscope and an electron microprobe) to collect microscopic imagery and collect micron-scale compositional data on mineral and glass samples as part of course laboratory activities and projects - and to test the educational impact of this kind of intervention in both introductory and upper level geoscience courses. \n\nThe project established classroom testbeds at three additional universities: a Hispanic-Serving institution, a Predominantly Undergraduate institution, and a 2-year college.  We developed activities with the instrumentation that were both short (single lab or demonstration), intermediate (2-3 labs) and long duration (semester projects) to try and assay what \"dosage\" of such activities might be necessary to produce the beneficial impacts in learning and behavioral change that had been observed in the USF pilot.   \n\nThe project included a robust outreach component, which involved engaging with potential faculty users and with students at regional geoscience meetings.  Essentially, the instruments were set up in remote operation mode at the meetings and participants were invited to try them.  On average about 10% of meeting attendees did so, which led to a number of faculty choosing to give the project's approaches a try in their classrooms.  Eight additional faculty did live demonstrations or class sessions with the instruments using project approaches and of these 2-3 have become regular classroom users.  Resources created for the project are posted on the facility website (fcaem.fiu.edu) and in SERC.\n\nA fortuitous alignment that raised interest in this project were the imperatives in the 2012 PCAST report and in several National Academy efforts focused on course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and their benefits for student learning and retention.  Interventions at two of our project sites are properly defined as CURES, and one of these was highlighted in the National Academy report on course-based undergraduate research experiences.\n\nAn additional effort in this project was the generation of learning assessments (i.e., test questions) that are reliable and effective for measuring learning in upper-level geosciences courses.  These assessments arre modeled on the chemistry-based Creative Exercises of Lewis et al (2010) and have been used at two our sites.  Validation and dissemination of these instruments is ongoing.\n\nThe project also established a model for supporting the educational use of a research-oriented microbeam reasearch facility obtained via Federal grant support.  A dedicated \"teaching\" postdoctoral scientist or equivalent is necessary in order to support educational users and get them rapidly up to speed on instrument use.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey G Ryan"
