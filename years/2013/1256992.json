 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of fascinating ecological interactions have evolved between resin producing plants and the wide array of organisms that exploit them. This research will explore how honey bees, Apis mellifera, select and exploit the pharmacological properties of resin to benefit the health of the colony. Honey bees are the most important pollinators of native and agro-ecosystems. Due to the average annual loss of over 30% of the U.S. honey bee colonies since 2006, it is important to promote the natural defenses of honey bees and the economic health of the beekeeping industry. Honey bees collect resin and deposit it in the nest where it is called propolis. A propolis envelope lining the inner walls of the nest acts as an external antimicrobial layer surrounding the colony, benefiting bee immune defenses and colony-level social immunity.  This research will explore if plant-derived chemical components in resin provide an important colony defense against both general microorganisms and specific pathogens of honey bees.  Further it will determine if bees increase resin collection and/or switch botanical sources of resin to those with greater biological activity after challenge with a bacterial pathogen. Four objectives will be pursued: 1) Determine if the propolis envelope is active against the bacterial pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood disease in field colonies. Findings will reveal novel approaches to promote honey bee health and explain the function of naturally collected compounds in mitigating diseases of honey bees. 2) Quantify if honey bees increase resin collection in response to challenge with a bacterial pathogen. These studies will shed light on the behavioral mechanisms underlying the collection of resin by a relatively rare subset of bees in the colony whose foraging choices contribute to social immunity at the colony level. 3) Identify the botanical sources of resins used by honey bees for propolis formulation by metabolite fingerprinting analysis. Findings from these analyses will establish the link between the origin of the biologically active substances and their ultimate impacts on honey bee health. This link will provide insight for future studies into the relationship between resin use and health among honey bee subspecies across the globe. 4) Identify bioactive components of propolis that inhibit growth of a honey bee bacterial pathogen using both bioassay-driven purification and metabolomics-based methods. Modern bioassay-guided chemical isolation will facilitate the discovery of previously unknown antimicrobial substances and open new research avenues into the role of resins as pharmacological agents in the ecology and evolution of plant-animal interactions. This research will attract and educate students in disciplines from applied beekeeping to metabolomic analyses and molecular genetics. Through a collaboration with Biology professors at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls, undergraduates participating in the BEE course (Bees Enhancing Education) the will analyze virus levels in bees from propolis-treated colonies, which will help them connect microbiology, ecology, botany, and molecular biology concepts to the relevant, \"real-world\" problem of pollinator decline. The PI's combined research, teaching, and extension appointments ensure that this research will be translated and disseminated to a diverse audience including scientists, traditional and non-traditional students, beekeepers, and the general public.",

Currently, honey bee populations are experiencing high and unsustainable annual losses due to a number of stressors that weaken bees? innate defenses, resulting in a downward spiral of health. Honey bees collect antimicrobial plant resins and incorporate them into the nest architecture as propolis. This research explored how honey bees select and exploit the pharmacological properties of resin to benefit the social immunity and pathogen defense of the colony. In the same manner in which resin secretion by a plant is constitutively produced or actively induced to assist in plant defense, our findings revealed that honey bees collect resins and deposit propolis constitutively when healthy, and actively when pathogen challenged, to reduce disease load and ultimately to benefit colony health.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The finding that a propolis envelope is vital to the health of <em>A. mellifera</em> is being conveyed to beekeepers across the world.&nbsp; As managed colonies do not deposit a propolis envelope on the smooth, planed surfaces of commercial bee boxes, research is underway to modify the design of commercial bee boxes to encourage bees to deposit a natural propolis envelope.&nbsp; Improving the health and survivorship of honey bee colonies will improve economic viability of the beekeeping industry, and will ensure there are sufficient colonies for pollination services and food security.&nbsp; Two graduate students obtained PhD?s on different objectives of this research, and a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduates were vital participants.

The therapeutic effects of propolis were observed after pathogen challenge: colonies with a propolis envelope had reduced clinical signs of chalkbrood, a fungal disease, and of American foulbrood, a bacterial disease.&nbsp; Although the mechanism is unknown, the propolis-rich environment increased the medicinal properties of the larval diet, warranting further exploration. The rates of resin foraging increased after colony infection with chalkbrood, which is the first evidence of social-medication in insects, where adults, without signs of infection, increased foraging of a non-nutritive substance to reduce infection of larval nest mates.</p>\n<p>Another study explored whether social-medication with resins involved bees collecting resins with higher antimicrobial activity after pathogen challenge. The botanical sources of resins were identified by metabolite-fingerprinting analysis of resin chemistries using liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Comparing resin from local trees and resin loads from returning foragers revealed that bees collected resin predominantly from <em>Populus deltoides </em>(Eastern cottonwood trees). Other minor sources of resins came from <em>P. balsamifera </em>(balsam poplar), and three as yet unidentified sources. Of the five different plant sources of resin, the resin from <em>P. deltoides </em>had the highest antimicrobial activity against American foulbrood, and both <em>P. deltoides </em>and <em>P. balsamifera </em>had high antimicrobial activity against chalkbrood. After challenge with these pathogens in the field, colonies did not change their foraging preference compared to control colonies; instead, they focused their resin foraging efforts on resin sources that they were already visiting before the pathogen challenge.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bioactive components of propolis that inhibit growth of honey bee pathogens were identified. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, pinobanksin-3-octanoate and five other 3-acyl-dihydroflavonols were isolated that showed inhibitory activity against the bee American foulbrood and chalkbrood. The 3-acyl-dihydroflavonols were first found in <em>Populus fremontii</em> resin from Nevada, but varying amounts were also found in other North American <em>Populus</em> resins, suggesting that these compounds could be markers of activity against the pathogen that causes American foulbrood disease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
