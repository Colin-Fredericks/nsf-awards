 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summer school entitled \"Compactifying Moduli Spaces\" will take place at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain from May 27 to 31, 2013.  The theme of the school is the different aspects of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, with particular attention to questions related to compactification.  Compactness is a fundamental property needed in order to apply degeneration techniques (e.g., for Brill-Noether type arguments) and for intersection theory (e.g., to define Gromov-Witten invariants). Generally, a natural moduli problem is not compact:  understanding how to compactify the moduli space and how this compactification depends on choices is the main topic of the school.  We will focus on two moduli problems:  the moduli of varieties and the moduli of vector bundles.\r\n\r\nThe school has three goals:  to introduce a new generation of students and researchers to the subject; to collect and survey recent development in the theory of moduli spaces; to formulate and disseminate new problems and directions of research.  There will be five mini-courses, given by the leading experts in the field.  The lectures will be complemented by afternoon sessions, where young algebraic geometers will present their work and explain examples and further insights on the material seen in the main courses.  This funding will be used to support the participation in the summer school of graduate students and young postdocs from universities in the U.S.  The conference website is http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Pages/ActivityDescriptions/Compactifying-Moduli-Spaces.aspx",
