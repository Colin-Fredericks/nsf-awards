 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eruption of low-viscosity, dark magma called basalt dominates volcanism on Earth, Mars, the Moon, and Venus. Compared to more viscous and more volatile-rich magmas, basalts are generally considered to have lower explosive potential, producing mild eruptions affecting relatively small geographical areas. Basaltic eruptions, however, display large variability and range from quiet lava flows and mild explosions to less common large explosions forming >30 km-high plumes that disperse fine ash up to several hundreds of kilometers.  The exact causes of these upper end-member explosions are debated in the literature. The largest recent eruption of a monogenetic basaltic scoria-cone volcano in the present-day contiguous USA took place ~900 years ago at Sunset Crater, about 25 km NE of Flagstaff, AZ. The eruption produced lava flows, but most of the erupted volume was ejected during at least 8 explosive phases that produced eruption plumes from 7 km to 25 km high and deposited scoria and ash blankets over the surrounding area. Scoria and ash thicknesses greater than 1 cm cover approximately 2,300 km2 and impacted prehistoric inhabitants, leading to population movement and dramatically altered settlement, subsistence, economic, and ritual systems.  The eruption figures in oral traditions of seven tribes in the area. A similar modern eruption would significantly affect the Southwest US, causing major disruption to commerce and air traffic.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine the Sunset Crater eruption in order to test hypotheses explaining the causes of unusually large and violent basaltic eruptions. The leading hypotheses are a) the magma is especially rich in volatiles, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, which provide the energy required to drive explosive eruptions and b) the magma viscosity abruptly increases in the shallow sub-surface due to magma outgassing and rapid crystallization, causing the basalt to hold its gases tightly, only to release them in a violent and explosive way upon reaching the surface. To help determine the importance of these processes at Sunset Crater, we will first determine the relative timing of the lava flow and eruption plume eruptions through stratigraphic correlation of the deposits.  Scoria textures (e.g. bubbles, crystals) will help reveal magma viscosity and provide information on late-stage eruption processes, whereas analysis of melt inclusions trapped in crystals that formed at greater depths will provide information on initial magma volatile contents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to understand the eruption of Sunset Crater, located near Flagstaff Arizona.  The eruption happened about AD 1085 and affected the people who were living in the area at the time.  The most remarkable feature of the deposits of Sunset Crater is that they are very widespread, covering an area greater than 2000 square km under more than 1 cm of ash or cinders (together called tephra).  To do this, the eruption must have sent the tephra high into the air so that they could travel far.  Our work defined the extent and characteristics of the tephra blanket and used that to determine that the eruption column reached heights of 15-20 km during the most intense parts of the eruption.  Studies of the amount of gas dissolved in the magma show that the magma, when it was deep in the crust, was not particularly gas rich &ndash; it had values in the normal range for basalts.  However, we also studied the characteristics of the tephra grains and found that there are two types.  One is a very glassy, bubbly, crystal-poor type called sideromelane and the other is a gray lava with many crystals, all surrounded by very abundant tiny crystals, with few bubbles that is called tachylite.  We think the tachylite ascended slowly and had time to crystallize and lose its gas, which may be typical for most scoria cones, whereas the sideromelane was a magma that rose very quickly and so did not lose its dissolved gas.  The deposits of the most widely dispersed tephra layers are rich in sideromelane.  We thus think that the unusually high eruption columns of Sunset Crater are not due to a particularly high amount of gas in the original magma, but rather due to its retention in the magma due to rapid ascent.\n\nWe found that the eruption began with a 10-km-long fissure that fountained a kilometer or two into the air, distributing tephra along its length and also forming lava flows where the fountain fell back to earth.  The eruption soon centered on Sunset Crater and started sending the eruption column high into the air, reaching 12-20 km for periods of hours.  At the same time, the volcano began to send two lava flows out from its base, one on the downhill side that eventually flowed about 11 km down a valley and the other on the uphill side, where it ponded against the volcano, forming a thick lava \"pad\" that extends about 2 km from the vent.  The eruption then decreased dramatically in intensity.  A magma column within the conduit rose and fell as large bubbles passed through it, bursting at the surface and scattering lava chunks onto the scoria cone.  At times, small columns of lava fountain formed, and also gray clouds of ash were carried downwind.  These deposited a black ash that covers the tephra and lava flows in places.  Corn impressions in lava spatter show that they were a few weeks short of maturity, suggesting that the eruption began in August or early September.  The lack of wind-blown dunes within the tephra sequence imply that the eruption was over before the high winds of March-June arrived, which implies the eruption took less than six months.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael H Ort"
