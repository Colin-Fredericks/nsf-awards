 "awd_abstract_narration": "A college education has become a near-necessity for much of the U.S. population: the equivalent of a high school diploma for earlier generations. As a result, ever greater numbers of students find themselves in contact with peers from beyond their own neighborhoods and home cities. The project will investigate the linguistic outcomes of this contact in two directions: speech modifications made by local students who have accommodated to non-local peers, and longer term changes in local dialects as a result of students bringing modifications into the community during and after college. The primary goal is to evaluate the effect of these outcomes on current models of language change.\r\n\r\nThe two communities are Philadelphia, PA, where there is considerable awareness of local dialect features (e.g. 'wooder' for 'water') and Lansing, MI, where the vowel system has undergone radical changes (e.g. 'hud' for 'head') that are un-noticed by the public. In each city, first-year undergraduates from local high schools will be recruited in institutions with varying concentrations of local speakers: in nationally oriented research universities, regional universities and community colleges. They will be interviewed by the research team using sociolinguistic techniques which focus on their social networks, as well as their linguistic experience in their first college year. A second interview will take place the following year to assess the impact of college on their local dialect features. The students interviewed will themselves learn interviewing techniques, which they will use to record younger members of their families and groups of high school friends. These recordings will trace the development of the college-influenced Philadelphia and Lansing dialects over time.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this study is the documentation of how language affects successful adjustment to the social environment of higher education, particularly for minority students whose dialects are marked by features considered non-standard. Over the two years of the project the relation between language adaptation and academic adjustment will become evident and should contribute to an understanding of the factors that ultimately determine completion rates in higher education.",

It focuses on a change in the Philadelphia dialect of English that has taken place in the past two decades, and asks why and how the language is changing.\n\n The particular change in view concerns the Philadelphia pronunciation of words spelled with \"short a\": man, ham, half, bath, pass, etc. In the traditional system, certain of these words are pronounced with a \"raised\" vowel that is otherwise heard only in the wprd \"yeah\". The raising follows a complex pattern that is unique to Philadelphia, and until recently was common to all social classes in the white population.

This nasal system follows a simple rule: raise the short-a vowel only before the \"nasal\" consonants m and n, but otherwise not.  Thus the raised vowel disappeared in mad, bad and glad but appeared in damage where it had never been heard before. The research project was designed to discover the social motivation of this change and how it is related to the movement of speakers through the educational system.\n\n The project began by interviewing undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania who had graduated from local high schools. The interview followed the social history of the speaker but included questions that concentrated the short-a words of interest (\"What\u00c6s the difference between damage and destruction?\"). Some of these undergraduates were then recruited and trained to interview their friends in high school and college, as well as older and younger members of their families. 106 of these transcribed interviews were then analyzed acoustically by new computational methods designed to display the relative positions of the vowels, with 5,000 to 10,000 measurements for each speaker.

Philadelphians were divided into two separate groups by these criteria, with very few in an intermediate position.\n\n            The short-a pattern most characteristic of African-American Vernacular English in Philadelphia is a neutralized system, with no difference between \"raised\" and \"unraised\" vowels. The 38 African American undergraduates included in the sample showed no tendency to use the traditional system. Their short-a patterns ranged from the neutralized to the nasal system. Again, the maximum use of the nasal system was found with graduates of high schools with special admission requirements.\n\n            A study of the educational histories of the subjects showed that the use of short-a systems is established before college. The use of the traditional or nasal system is largely determined by the percent of speakers of various ethnic backgrounds in early and middle school. There is little consciousness of the short-a distributions, but speakers who favor the nasal system generally describe the local dialect as \"ignorant\" or \"uneducated\" speech.\n\n            The shift to the nasal system can be found in many parts of the U..."
