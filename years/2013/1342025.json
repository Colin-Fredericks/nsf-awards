 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cultural developments of the last 10,000 years have involved two critical transitions in human lifeways: the emergence of the first settled villages and the development of complex societies which characterize modern life. Patrick Dolan, with the support of the National Science Foundation and under the guidance of Dr. Colin Grier at Washington State University, will conduct fieldwork at the Dionisio Point site a prehistoric hunter-gatherer village on the coast of British Columbia, Canada. This village was occupied at a time when the inhabitants of this region achieved levels of social complexity rarely witnessed outside of agricultural societies, providing an important counter-balance to explanations of social complexity as a consequence of the emergence of food production.\r\n\r\nIn coastal southwestern British Columbia, Canada, the emergence of settled plankhouse villages between 2500 and 1000 years ago corresponds to a period of increasingly demarcated social status, wealth, and eventually greater warfare. Archaeological research in this and the surrounding region indicates that the emergence and organization of large multi-family households were critical in the unfolding of these cultural developments. However, due to a shortage of empirical data, the social and economic articulations between households within a village remain uncertain. Were villages cohesive collective socially and economically? Were they organized from the top-down around the demands of powerful households? Or were households relatively autonomous of one another, pursuing their own goals on a regional stage? Few settlements dating to this period have been sampled in a manner that permits the evaluation of these alternatives, and this research will fill this gap in knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis project will be one of the first to systematically examine these questions within a single village in southwestern British Columbia. The fieldwork component of this research will be conducted at the Dionisio Point site, a multi-household, Coast Salish village occupied between 1500 and 1300 years ago on Galiano Island in coastal southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Evaluating the structure of inter-household economic relations in this village will require refining the occupational history for the village at Dionisio Point as well as characterizing long-term household production and consumption practices. Using excavated materials collected from household architecture and refuse deposits associated with each of the five houses at the site, this project will recover materials that will permit radiocarbon dating, as well as the comparison of the remains of the fauna households consumed, the tools they used, and their respective storage capacities. \r\n\r\nThis research promotes collaboration between researchers in the USA and Canada, as well as a greater appreciation of the value of prehistory to the public and of the cultural heritage of local First Nations peoples. This project will contribute to the professional development of graduate students in both field methods and laboratory analyses. Results will be disseminated widely in academic circles through professional publications, and to the public through talks and newsletters. Ultimately, this project will promote continued engagement of academic archaeologists with descendent communities and the Galiano Island resident community, fostering improved collaboration in the preservation of the cultural heritage of this region.",
