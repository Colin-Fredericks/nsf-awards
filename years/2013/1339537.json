 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative multi-instrument investigation of the high-latitude geospace system will be carried out, motivated by the completion of the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars RISR-N and RISR-C, the first ever ISRs deployed to the geomagnetic polar regions. Initial results from RISR-N have revealed an unexpectedly structured and dynamic plasma environment. In order to understand these new measurements and to fully exploit this new diagnostic capability, an experimental campaign is proposed that will synthesize RISR observations with data from the collocated optical sensors (Fabry-Perot Interferometer and Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imager), the PolarDARN HF (high frequency) radars, the THEMIS and NORSTAR camera networks, and the global ISR network (in particular, Sondrestrom, the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), and the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT)). \r\n\r\nThis project will leverage the new diagnostic information provided by RISR to foster collaborative studies of the high latitude geospace system. The guiding questions of the investigation arise from this systems view: 1. What governs the internal structure and HF propagation characteristics of plasma density patches? 2. How do auroral processes affect structure and composition of the polar ionosphere, and what are the global-scale implications? 3. What are the important interactions between the plasma and neutral gases at polar latitudes? 4. How do the aforementioned processes control the distribution of plasma on high-latitude flux tubes? \r\n\r\nThis project will provide a wealth of information on the ionospheric boundary for modelers to enhance our understanding of the ionospheric boundary. The investigation of plasma structuring mechanisms will have implications for communications and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal propagation. The investigation of plasma-neutral interactions will shed light on how the lower atmosphere drives the global geospace system. The research will be carried out through an 8-institution international collaborative (4 from the U.S., 2 from Canada, 2 from Japan). The project will contribute to training the next generation of geophysicists, and the team will include three early career investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe polar, terrestrial ionosphere is home to many interesting phenomena of importance to the geospace system, including polar cap auroral arcs and polar cap plasma density patches.  Plasma density structuring commonly occurs near both arcs and patches and these structures have affect radio propagation and escape of plasma from the ionosphere.  Polar cap plasma patches are regions of high density that detach from the dayside ionosphere and are carried by convection across the polar cap and into the nightside aurora zone.  The edges of these patches have very steep density gradients and, as a result, represent sympathetic conditions for gradient-drift instability (GDI), which fractures the large patches into small-scale, turbulent density structures.  Shear-related instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz - KHI) may also play a role in initial structuring of plasma patches.  Polar cap auroral arcs are a phenomena which also structure plasma density through joule heating of the atmosphere-ionosphere and associated changes in ionospheric chemical reaction rates hence composition.  Density structures, at small scales impact trans-ionospheric radio propagation (e.g. HF backscatter and GPS phase scintillation).  Density structures also represent a variable source of ionospheric plasma to mechanisms such as the classical polar wind, which contribute to ionospheric escape.  \n\n \n\nDespite the importance of ionospheric plasma density structures to ionospheric escape and radio propagation, very little is known about how these structures initially form, interact with the local thermosphere, and cascade to smaller, turbulent scale sizes.  Specific objectives of this collaborative project were to determine:  (1)  processes governing the internal structure and HF propagation characteristics of plasma density patches, (2)  ways in which polar cap auroral processes affect structure and composition of the ionosphere, (3) important interactions between the plasma and neutral gases in polar regions, and (4) how coupling of different polar ionospheric processes modify the distribution of plasma on high-latitude flux tubes? \n\n \n\nThe main contribution of the ERAU modeling and theory team was to develop and apply new, state-of-the-art numerical models of the polar ionosphere toward the science goals above.  The main model adapted and developed for this project was GEMINI (the Geospace Environment Model of Ion-Neutral Interactions), which can describe the effects of electric fields, particle precipitation, and field-aligned currents on the ionosphere.  This model can simulate formation of density structures (Perry et al, 2015; Fisher et al, 2015) and can also self-consistently simulate GDI and KHI initiation and nonlinear evolution (e.g. Zettergren 2015).  GEMINI has been used to study generation of GPS phase scintillation from polar cap patches undergoing both GDI and KHI, and has been shown to be a promising tool for better-understanding scintillation and HF backscatter from plasma structures.  Furthermore, we have proposed and demonstrated a new mechanism by which the polar ionosphere may be preconditioned for instability.  This mechanism involves generation of a strong density cavity via joule heating in the downward current region of a polar cap auroral arc, which then can undergo GDI.  GEMINI has been extensively compared against observations from both AMISR systems (PFISR and RISR), an activity which is a useful validation exercise, but that also allows the model to be effectively use to interpret multi-model data sets (Fernandes et al, 2016).  GEMINI has also been extended under this support to include a bi-Maxwellian set of transport equations (this form of the model only functions in 2D) capable of describing strong temperature anisotropies that develop fairly frequently in the polar ionosphere.  The primary use of this version of the model has been to accurately describe ionosphere escape, and the model illustrated of impacts of temperature anisotropy and neutral wind forcing to ionospheric upflow (Burleigh and Zettergren, 2017).  \n\n \n\nThis award has supported several graduate students in addition to the PI.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Zettergren"
