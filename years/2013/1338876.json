 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funding for the University of Delaware (UDEL) to join the Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD). Georgia Tech at CPD is the lead institution, while the University of Kentucky Is a 'Partner' site. \r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC Site at the University of Delaware will bring world-class expertise to an existing Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD) in technical areas that are central to biopharmaceutical development innovation. These areas are currently absent or represent only a small portion of the expertise within the CPD, and will enable the CPD to build upon its strengths focused on development of small-molecule pharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes, and related biotechnology products; making the expanded CPD an even more robust and high-impact I/UCRC. The faculty in the proposed Site for the CPD are world-recognized leaders, and will provide new strengths to the current CPD that complements the existing expertise in solid-state pharmaceutical stability and delivery, and development of industrial enzymes and related biotechnology products. \r\n\r\nThe proposed, expanded CPD will be the most far-reaching industry-university consortium to date that is focused on pharmaceutical product development, rather than discovery research or clinical development. The project areas it will address have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and economics of drug development research and engineering, as well as the fundamental understanding and education of engineers and scientists in the industry. This can benefit the U.S. broadly in terms of domestic job creation, as well as improved time to market, cost to patients, and reduced risk for investors for the development and testing of new therapeutic proteins (focus of UD Site) and innovator pharmaceuticals more generally (focus of CPD overall). The PIs will involve students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, including through research internships that are funded internally or through complementary federal funding.",
