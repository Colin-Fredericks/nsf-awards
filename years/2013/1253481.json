 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-to-cell communication is fundamental to cell and system functions. Proper communication between cells relies upon precise control and coordination of extracellular and intracellular signaling, as well as the induced cellular responses such as cell morphogenesis. This project is to study cell-to-cell communication through yeast mating system using mathematical modeling and will be conducted in close collaboration with experimentalists. The project will develop the models and the computational framework for a multi-cell environment that includes complex extracellular and intracellular signaling networks and the cell morphological changes. Numerical methods will be developed to meet the computational modeling challenges. \r\n\r\nCells interact with their environment or with other cells through sensing and making responses such as cell movement and cell shape change. These processes require precise coordination of intricate cellular networks and the resulting responses. This project will use mathematical modeling and computation to examine the interaction between cells and the underlying networks. The models and computational framework developed in this research can be applied to other systems, such as neural and immune systems, in which cell-to-cell communication is central to their function. Therefore, this project can aid medical research. The research in this project will be integrated with educational activities in computational and mathematical methods, with the aim of training undergraduate and graduate students for interdisciplinary research in mathematical biology.",
