 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innovation implements a theoretically pure, fair, and accurate credit assignment mechanism whenever information content is reused.  The technology is implemented as an algorithm that recursively detects chains of reused content regardless of how far back the chain proceeds. It accounts for changes in authorship each time ideas are reused and for content perturbations in which the essence of an idea is described using different language. A second part of the algorithm uses market gamification to establish the relative value of reused and novel content then apportion the value from reused content back to original sources of novel content.  Distinguishing value from quantity is essential because it is often possible to develop a succinct expression of an important idea and a long-winded expression of an unimportant idea. Further, this technology accounts for complementary ideas whose value is greater than the sum of the parts. Since the theoretical ideal is mathematically complex, the algorithm also introduces several novel efficiency shortcuts.  Finally, the technology provides a visual display of reused content that helps motivate original sources to share their ideas and aid users in finding related ideas.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this technology draws from its ability to improve white-collar productivity.  Numerous research studies show that people who volunteer information thrive on recognition.  Conversely, stealing a person's ideas limits their willingness to share.  A well functioning credit attribution system therefore has the potential to improve idea sharing as well as the opportunity to recombine ideas in new ways so as to foster profits and innovation. For example, an unrelated MIT study showed firms that reuse their information have 12% higher revenue growth.  In a related study, document reuse among a bank's loan officers increased productivity by as much as 10%. Virtually all Fortune 500 firms use document repositories of one form or another. Adding recognition and incentives can improve individual willingness to push valuable information into systems where it can be repurposed by coworkers.  These create measurable economic gains in an identifiable and large market.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Review of the Project and its Major Goals\n\nFor NSF SBIR Phase I, we proposed to build a software platform with a set of knowledge tracking and trading methods to facilitate information sharing, price that information, and boost productivity inside organizations. Methods are based on Nobel-prize winning economics as well as new statistical methods that we have developed.  We call such a platform a \"knowledge economy\" inside a community or an organization.  Such a system is capable of providing the following services from a technological and functional standpoint:\n\nThe value of information or innovation contributed by users is recognized and counted using \"credits\", a type of currency in the system;\nThe system is able to track information reuse, and give credits back to original sources;\nKnowledge marketplaces allow users to exchange (trade) information or service following market rules, and efficiently map experts to problems;\nManagers of the system can stimulate or curate information-sharing activities by employing economic tools, such as controlling the issuance of credits, and running \"campaigns\".\n\n\nSuch a \"knowledge economy\" is aimed at addressing the following critical challenges faced by organizations or educational institutions today, especially in the domain of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation:\n\nMembers lack incentives to share or contribute information because they are not credited or rewarded properly;\nInefficient allocation of human resources to problems firms must tackle;\nSuboptimal productivity and business outcomes can be improved by promoting collaboration, decentralized innovation and information sharing.\n\n\nWe have made significant progress towards our vision, and met our NSF SBIR Phase-I objectives by advancing software development, key algorithms as part of our technology, and commercialization plans.\nSummary of Research Activities and Results\n\nSoftware/Product Development\n\nWe have developed a functional software system, \"Barter\", which implements a knowledge exchange supported by credits (currency), market rules, managerial tools, and advanced tracking functions. A version of the document reuse-tracking algorithm is also implemented and integrated as a module on Barter. The software system well achieves the purposes of demonstration and potential pilot with interested organizations.\n\nBarter is designed with a two-tier architecture: engine layer, and application layer.  The engine layer provides common core technology modules to support different organizational applications, such as knowledge markets, reuse tracking &amp; credit assignment, and economic managerial tools, etc. An \"app\" on the application layer consists of a subset of markets and tools supported by the engine layer, and aims at tackling collaboration and sharing challenges for one particular business unit, such as R&amp;D, Help Desk &amp; Support, and Sales.\n\nBased on our interactions with potential customers, we have defined and selected a subset of features and technology modules in our \"Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\" that would most effectively address customers\u00c6 pain points on collaboration and information sharing. We implemented them following our two-tier architecture. These features and modules best demonstrate the strengths and innovation of our differentiating technology.\n\nR&amp;D on Key Algorithms\n\nOne key technology on our \"knowledge economy\" platform is information reuse tracking and credit assignment. Such technology tracks reused portions of a newly uploaded document against existing documents in the system, and attribute credits to original authors whenever downstream documents generate long-term value. The key assumption here is that users are more motivated to share knowledge for their original contribution always gets recognized and credited fairly.\n\nWe have completed designing a version of the algorithm, and implemented reuse tracking with graphical interfaces as a critical module on Barter. But it faces limitat..."
