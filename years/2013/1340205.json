 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been extensive academic and industry research, especially over the last decade on\r\ndeveloping spectrum using concepts and architectures. These include research on dynamic spectrum\r\naccess, spectrum sharing, co-existence, spectrum databases, new protocols, wireless security\r\nand others. However, deployable dynamic spectrum sharing technologies do not exist. The fundamental\r\nissues of spectrum sharing trust and security remain. It is critical that the research that\r\nhas been done and proven in indoor environments is well understood, collaborated and transformed\r\ninto deployable technologies by industry and government, even as new research is being initiated.\r\nThis calls for open collaboration between the research communities along with integrated outdoor\r\ntest facilities for performing realistic research experimentation (augmenting smaller indoor\r\nwireless testbeds across the nation), across various bands and applications. The proposed\r\nannual research symposium is needed to create the national collaboration between the research\r\nand other ecosystem stakeholders.",
