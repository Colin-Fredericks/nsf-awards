 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to advance knowledge of the middle to early Holocene (ca. 4500-2000 cal BP) development of maritime economies along the northern coast of Alaska through an interior-coastal comparison of Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt) sites and assemblages. The project is a doctoral dissertation improvement grant to study maritime adaptation as it relates to the origins and spread of ASTt ca. 4500-4000 BP. This research will focus on maritime resources and coastal orientations, rather than the more traditional assumption that ASTt was a more land-based adaptation. The analysis will include artifact and faunal analysis from existing collections made at Iyatayet and Walakpa archaeological sites, as well as new excavation at Iyatayet to hopefully recover faunal material (which was not collected by Giddings).  In addition, the researcher will include the participation of local Alaska Native high school students in the field excavations as part of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science projects.",
