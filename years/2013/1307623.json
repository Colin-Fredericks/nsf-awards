 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detection of gravitational waves will provide a totally new view of the transient sky. The advanced LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, will soon open an era when mysterious questions regarding gamma-ray bursts, the most relativistic and energetic stellar explosions, will be clarified via multi-messenger studies. In this framework, the present award supports: (i) the training of a graduate student who can work, within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, on LIGO searches in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts; (ii) studies related to the electromagnetic follow-up of LIGO-Virgo triple coincidence triggers; (iii) searches for \"longer-duration\" gravitational wave signals, aimed at probing the magnetar progenitor scenario for gamma-ray bursts. The detection of gravitational waves could probe, for the first time directly, the nature of gamma-ray burst progenitors. The discovery of an \"orphan afterglow\" via electromagnetic follow-up of a gravitational wave trigger, would yield the most dramatic confirmation of the jet model for gamma-ray bursts. The detection of a longer-duration gravitational wave signal in coincidence with a gamma-ray burst, could probe the nature of the central engine (magnetar versus black-hole), and explain some of the most puzzling observational properties of the early afterglow phase.\r\n\r\nAn important component of this project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students at being the next generation of astrophysicists: scientists capable of bridging astronomy and gravitational physics. Students' participation in LIGO engineering runs dedicated to the preparation of the advanced detectors, is encouraged. A wider dissemination of the concept of gravitational wave astronomy, and awareness of LIGO as the US national facility dedicated to opening a new era in astronomy, are promoted through lectures offered at a local planetarium. The last serves public school students belonging, for the vast majority, to underrepresented groups.",
