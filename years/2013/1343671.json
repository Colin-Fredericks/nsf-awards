 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal life history traits include survival, dispersal and reproduction, all of which change with age.  These life history traits depend on food intake and on allocation of that food to body maintenance, activity and making offspring.  Variation in the amount of food eaten can affect nutrient allocation among these traits, changing age at death, activity patterns, and timing, numbers and quality of offspring.  Likewise, increased demands for allocation to activity can reduce allocation to other traits.  Feeding and allocation patterns also affect trait senescence, or loss of function with age.  How the set of life history traits changes with food stress or with activity stress is not well understood.  Using an insect test system, this work will examine how such environmental stresses alter life history traits, using both laboratory physiological experiments and field observations.  Techniques will include stable isotope analysis, insect respirometry, micro-analysis of chemical composition of eggs and measurements of body morphology.  This work will contribute to understanding the impacts of environmental change on organisms' survival and reproduction.  To do this, the work will connect experimental laboratory results with field observations, to build an understanding of how life history traits respond to environmental variation in the wild, and of trait senescence in the wild.  The work will also test the theory of nutrient allocation as the basis for life history trade-offs.  \r\n\r\nThe project will include mentoring of undergraduates, women and minorities in research.  Research results will be used in teaching, and teaching ideas will be published for use by others.  The work builds on extensive field databases at a field station.  Educational outreach associated with the project will also be directed to the general public.  Outreach will include a continuing studies course, work with a public education program, development of museum exhibit materials, talks for community groups and radio shows, and newspaper articles.  Journalists will participate, both to learn about the project and in turn to educate students and scientists on communication with the press and the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nOur work was aimed at understanding life history and metabolic responses to environmental variation, using butterflies as a focal organism.  We asked 3 questions:\n\n1. How do constraints in the adult stage (diet restriction, flight demand) affect resource allocation to life history traits, including lifespan, fecundity, egg composition and metabolic rates?  How do these life history traits change with age, reflecting reproductive and metabolic senescence? \n\nWe found that adult dietary restriction had no effect on lifespan, but decreased the number of eggs produced by a female in two species with different natural histories.  While egg mass did not change, egg composition changed under adult dietary restriction, in a species-specific manner.  Flight capability, measured by flight metabolic rate, was not affected by adult dietary restriction.  However resting metabolism decreased under adult nutrient stress, consistent with the reduction in egg production.  Taken together, the results indicate that flight capacity is conserved during adult nutritional stress but that investment in flight and survival can negatively affect other important physiological processes when resources from adult feeding are limited.\n\nWe found that females compensated for extra flight demand by increasing their adult food intake.  This increased food intake maintained lifespan and all aspects of reproduction.  However, extra flight elevated resting metabolic rate, indicating increased maintenance costs, and resulted in more rapid senescence in flight capability, as measured by flight metabolic rate. This contrasts with the beneficial effects of exercise seen in many vertebrate animals.\n\n2. How do constraints on larval feeding affect resource allocation to life history traits?  How do resulting life history traits change with age, reflecting reproductive and metabolic senescence?\n\nLarval dietary restriction resulted in smaller adult females, as expected.  Adult food intake did not compensate for larval dietary restriction, and metabolic rates were unaffected.  We saw a trend for females subjected to larval dietary restriction to have shorter lifespans than control females.  Combined with alterations in number of eggs laid relative to body size and in egg composition, our data suggest that resource allocation is adjusted to increase fecundity under conditions of larval dietary restriction. \n\n3. Are these patterns, including of senescence, seen in wild populations?\n\nPredictions from lab experiments were only partially borne out in the field.  Egg dry mass, protein and glycogen increased with increasing adult food availability, contrary to lab results.  Rather than being affected by current adult food availability, as predicted, egg triglyceride content was correlated with the previous year\u00c6s food availability, and hence showed a maternal effect.  While resting metabolic rate decreased with age as expected, adult food availability had no overall effect on this trait. Flight metabolic rate varied among years, but not with adult food availability.  \n\nThe answers to these questions are fundamental to understanding physiological trade-offs among life history traits, and life history response to environmental stress.  Comparative studies between field and lab are very rare, also, particularly for a broad suite of traits, but are increasingly critical to understanding organismal response to environmental change due to land use, novel species or climate.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nOver the entire course of the project, the work has contributed to human resource development through providing opportunities for research experience for a post-doctoral fellow, a technician, a temporary technician, an undergrad senior honors student, 33 other undergraduates and one high school student. Twenty-six of the undergraduates are women, and six are under-represented minorities. In addition, the post-doc gained experience in mentoring undergraduates, and presented the..."
