The meeting will include NSF staff as well as two representatives from each of ten NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatories, 5 CZO Steering Committee members, and the CZO national coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will highlight research results and plans from the existing and new CZOs as a status report to NSF and as a starting point for discussions of intensified collaboration within the new expanded CZO network. The primary goals of the meeting are to identify and discuss research and education challenges in Critical Zone science of common interest within the expanded network, to vitalize collaborative activities, and to consider issues associated with common measurements, data management, and observatory management plans. Ample time for planning and interaction with the new CZOs is included.",
