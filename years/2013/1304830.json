 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Proposed program aims at advancing  of  several directions of research  across the principal areas  of  the modern structural theory of dynamical systems: hyperbolic (mostly and non-uniform),  partially hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic with a  particular emphasis   on  various kinds of rigidity phenomena and on  applicability of several powerful methods across areas. New methods and insights have  been introduced  by the PI and his collaborators  over the past years.  The most recent advances allowed to obtain arithmetic structure  almost everywhere smooth in the sense of Whitney on a set of arbitrarily large measure for  a class of maximal rank actions  (the rank of the acting group is one less than the dimension of phase space) under a very general assumption of  sufficient  complexity. A dichotomy was established: for such actions: either there is not exponential complexity at all, or its measure  ( a version of entropy) is uniformly bounded from below by a constant that grows to infinity with  dimension. Directions in the proposed program include extension of the arithmeticity  program to  broader classes of  actions with the rank not related to dimension,  applications of measure rigidity  to Zimmer program,  further development of the entropy theory and entropy rigidity for  higher rank abelian actions, completing the program of differentiable rigidity of  partially hyperbolic  algebraic actions of higher rank abelian groups, the study of rigidity phenomena for  totally non- hyperbolic, unipotent actions that present a striking contrast for the classical case,  non-standard KAM-types invariant curve theorem and further investigation of the smooth realization problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamical systems serve as mathematical models of time evolution of   various process across the areas of natural and social sciences. It also has a  surprisingly broad range of applications within  core mathematical disciplines,  most particularly  to  various areas of geometry and number theory. Within many of these contexts the \"time\"  is not necessarily the usual  one-dimensional time  but it can be multi-dimensional or, of even more general nature that is  described by the key mathematical concept of group.  There is a crucial difference between the classical case of one-dimensional time and that of multi-dimensional time:  while in the former case  various  complexity and chaotic phenomena may appear gradually and  chaotic   behavior can and usually does coexists with ordered one within the same systems (e.g. ordered  planetary motions vs. chaotic behavior of  some asteroids and smaller objects in the solar system), in the latter  as was established by the PI and his collaborators) complexity is often global  and in fact chaos appears in a highly structured way and with high albeit  calculable levels of complexity as measured by a proper version of the fundamental notion of entropy.",
