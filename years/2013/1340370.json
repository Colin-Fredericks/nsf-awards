  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 10th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors (ICNS-10) presented high-impact scientific and technological advances in materials and devices based on group-III nitride semiconductors.  Hosted in Washington DC, the conference featured plenary sessions, parallel topical sessions, poster sessions and an industrial exhibition.  The exhibit offered the most direct access to researchers from around the world who are seeking technical solutions to their challenges.\n\nTwo primary objectives were to (1) implement and increase information exchange and collaboration among academic, industrial, and government scientists and policy makers to accelerate scientific and technological advances; and (2) provide to young scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members a great opportunity to present their most recent research results and to interact with worldwide recognized experts in the nitride research area.\n\nThe plenary and contributing invited speakers sessions included scientists and engineers whose research work has resulted in major breakthroughs in specific nitride semiconductor research areas such as ultraviolet emitters and detectors, sensors, solar cells, and high-power and high-frequency electronic devices.  Despite the ongoing global economic climate, the conference was very well attended with 893 participants from 31 countries.  The steady attendance is testament to the continuing development of III-nitrides as a material for a wealth of applications including those needed for a 'greener' world with applications in both more powerful and efficient lighting, electrical power transmission, and electrical vehicles.  The field continues to grow and diversify; and as a result, for the first time, the conference series ran four parallel sessions covering the entire spectrum of III-nitride semiconductor research and application, extending to cover newer, or less developed concepts such as solar cells and sensor applications.  The organizers received 184 submissions for the conference proceedings to be published in Physica Status Solidi.  Of these, 177 have been accepted for publication in a special volume, with 37 being accepted for the special sections:  Phys.Status Solidi A and B.\n\nNSF funding for this conference provided travel support for invited speakers and graduate and undergraduate students who, otherwise, would not have been able to attend the conference.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
