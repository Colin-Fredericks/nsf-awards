 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Peter Chen from Spelman College and his undergraduate student colleagues will develop a high resolution UV-VIS coherent multidimensional spectrometer by extensively upgrading an instrument that has been used to demonstrate high resolution coherent 2D spectroscopy capable of obtaining new information in complex molecular (electronic) spectra. This coherent multidimensional spectrometer is unique because of its ability to analyze gas phase samples with higher spectral resolution than traditional one-dimensional methods.  Professor Chen and his team will test the capabilities of the new instrument through extensive collaboraiton with research groups at Emory University, MIT, the Univeristy of Chicago, and Georgia Tech. \r\n\r\nThe methods and instrumentation that is being developed by Professor Chen and his student collaborators will be useful in identifying the underlying molecular physics that makes some molecular spectra very difficult to understand.  In addition, the spectrometer may also find use in identifying the photochemcial processes taking place in atmospherically important species.  The undergraduates working with Professor Chen will learn valuable skills with lasers, electronics, optical detectors and the design of complex instruments, giving them an excellent background for work in graduate school or the wider technological workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMuch of what is known in science has been and continues to be determined using spectroscopy.  However, spectroscopy is generally more useful for pure substances than it is for mixtures, and most real samples are mixtures.  For some applications, scientists can separate a sample into separate pure substances for spectroscopic analysis.  But in other applications a separation is impractical.  Consider, for example, combustion, which is the main source of energy production in the world.  Spectroscopy is one of the best tools for studying combustion; it is non-invasive, and beams of laser light can serve as useful probes that do not get damaged by high temperatures and severe conditions.  However, combustion systems contain a rich mixture of different molecules, and separating such molecules inside a combustion process is impractical.  As a result, little is known about the rich mixture of molecular species present in combustion systems.  \n\nMultidimensional spectroscopy can deal with mixtures much better than conventional spectroscopy can.  For example, in our high resolution form of 2D spectroscopy, the peaks are distributed onto a 2D surface in recognizable patterns that help show which peaks belong to the same molecule.  Therefore, reduction of spectral congestion and peak identication can both be achieved by going from 1D to 2D.  Our research group has built the world's only coherent multidimensional spectrometer designed for gas phase molecules.  However, this prototype instrument was badly in need of repairs and upgrades.  The work carried out in this project included reparing the failing components, upgrading the instrument so that it could work in  different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet and infrared), and expanding the instrument?s efficiency and capabilities. For example, our 3D technique is even more powerful than the 2D technique, and it requires that we take both 2D and 3D data.  The expansion provides us with the ability to take both 2D and 3D data at the same time. \n\nThe work has been carried out by a team of researchers at Spelman College, a historically black college for women.  Almost all of the team members were black women.  The project has allowed these students to develop specific skills in areas related to lasers, optics, molecular spectroscopy, instrumental design and testing, and quantum mechanics.  This project was also important because the number of African American women in the physical sciences in the U.S. has long been very small.  To the best of our knowledge, our group is the only undergraduate group in the world that is carrying out cutting-edge research in the new and exciting field of coherent multidimensional spectrosocpy. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter C Chen"
