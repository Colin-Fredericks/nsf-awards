These meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad\r\nspectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on\r\ncomplexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of\r\narithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory,\r\nrecursion theory/computability theory, set theory, subsystems of\r\nanalysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson,\r\nand topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses\r\nof the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate\r\nstudents and those without access to their own funding.\r\n\r\nVia the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the\r\nvitality of the field of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is\r\nplaced on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and\r\nmembers of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially\r\nwomen. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which\r\nall interested persons are invited to contribute and in which\r\nthere are lectures on current topics of research.\r\n\r\nInformation about MAMLS may be found by visiting http://mamls.org",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) was a regional\n\nseminar in mathematical logic that had been existence since the fall\n\nof 1982.  For the years covered by the current grant (2013 -2017), MAMLS\n\nconferences were held at Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, the\n\nCUNY Graduate Center, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Miami\n\nUniversity of Ohio, Rutgers University, Virginia Commonwealth University,\n\nWellesley College, and Wesleyan University.  The purpose of MAMLS was\n\nto promote and disseminate current research in mathematical logic by\n\nmaking known to both faculty and students the latest results in the field.  In\n\nparticular, by exposing graduate students to current work in logic, the\n\ndevelopment of future researchers in the field was effectuated.  The number of\n\npeople in attendance at MAMLS meetings varied, usually in the range of\n\nbetween fifteen and fifty people.  The composition of a MAMLS audience\n\nincluded graduate students, junior faculty (including postdocs), and senior\n\nfaculty, with the occasional smattering of undergraduates. Typically, students\n\ncomprised at least 10% of a MAMLS audience, with many conferences attracting\n\nan even greater level of student participation.  The number of women at a typical\n\nMAMLS meeting was also at least 10% of those in attendance.  Unfortunately,\n\nhowever, participation by members of other underrepresented groups in\n\nmathematics was scant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Arthur W Apter"
