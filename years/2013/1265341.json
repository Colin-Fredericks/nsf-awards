 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entails research on software engineering (e.g., mapping requirements to software architectures, software architecture models and their adaptation, software re-factoring, adaptable/autonomic middleware, etc), networking (software-defined networking, ad-hoc peer-to-peer networks, social private networks, etc), computer systems (virtualization, distributed computing, etc). The work will also provide techniques and middleware for distributed cyberinfrastructure supportive of mobile-hosted apps for science and education (e.g. middleware for virtual networking, social collaboration, resource virtualization and virtual appliances for different domains). By studying the mobile application-induced workload at the lowest layers of the systems software stack, such as the VMM, the project will identify how these layers can be improved to better support such workloads.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the fundamental understanding of multiple technical issues faced in enabling flexible end-to-end management of cloud-supported mobile applications. Methods are needed to (re)implement applications so that their software architectures can reconfigure in response to changes in requirements as the environment changes, and to allow for runtime re-factoring of components for execution locally or remotely. Virtual networking techniques are needed to enable seamless off-loading of computation from a device to remote resources possibly provided by multiple clouds. In addition, both software adaptation and network configuration must be done on demand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Ordinary users increasingly use the mobile cloud to access information, services, and entertainment.  Mobile cloud applications are both ubiquitous and technically new.  As they span mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) and data center infrastructures (i.e., the cloud), they create fresh opportunities in architecture, design, and implementation of distributed, user-centered applications and systems.  This project aimed to advance the fundamental understanding of multiple technical issues faced in enabling flexible end-to-end management of such applications. To this end, research and development was conducted to address the following questions: (1) How to reconfigure applications to allow execution of their modules either locally (on the mobile device) or remotely (on cloud resources) for improved performance and/or power consumption, in response to changes in requirements? (2) How to seamlessly connect a mobile device to trusted devices in the user?s (social) network and across multiple cloud infrastructures for computation offloading?  (3) What user-centered and model-based approaches can be used determine when and how to perform adaptations, at runtime, of the execution of a cloud-supported mobile application?  The collaborative research and development undertaken in this project has led to several outcomes.    \n \nWe developed a model-defined approach to build a management system that enables management of multiple clouds connected by a virtual network in a unified and customized manner. The system we developed enables advanced management tasks (such as virtual machine placement in a cloud-of-clouds environment), and improvements to the synchronization between the runtime models and the real system.\n \nThe project also created a mobile offloading system that integrates a framework for code partitioning into tasks, a scheduler that uses machine-learning techniques to determine whether tasks should be executed locally or offloaded, and a social virtual private network that automatically connects the mobile device to desktop, server, or cloud resources that belong to the user?s social network.  Using this integration, we performed quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance and cost for several machine-learning algorithms with respect to training time, classification time, and scheduling accuracy for the specific mobile cloud problem of adapting to the varying network conditions and remote computing capabilities.  The social virtual private network, which is intrinsic to the approach, incurs little overhead for latency and energy consumption, despite its encryption and tunneling\n \nUser tolerance for delay in mobile cloud applications enables scheduling and optimizations that may lead to collective benefit, for example lowering the energy required of the data center.  To this end, we studied the limits of user tolerance in these applications, and approaches for increasing them.   We used the code partitioning framework to create versions of common applications in which we could randomly modulate delay to the data center and elicit user feedback about satisfaction.   We then conducted a range of user studies to measure the tolerance.  Surprisingly, our results suggest that most users will tolerate considerable delays to be introduced in between the smartphone and the data center with little change of their satisfaction.  In other studies, we allowed users to directly set their delay and then tried to influence them to increase it.   Apprising users of the likely sustainability benefits (lower energy use) of doing so does not appear to increase their delay tolerance.  However, it does appear to be increased if users can compare their setting to that of a social group, or if there is some virtue-signaling mechanism.    Given a delay limit, we demonstrated mechanism that uses it to shape the smartphone/data center interaction traffic to have statistical properties that simply analysis and enable more potentially energy-efficient scheduling.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Renato J Figueiredo"
