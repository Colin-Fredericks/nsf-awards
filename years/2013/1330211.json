 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intrinsic Disorder, Energetic Coupling and Allostery\r\n\r\nThe current project investigates the role of protein intrinsic disorder (ID) in mediating signaling in the transcription factor family of proteins, a process known as allostery. By measuring the stability and DNA binding affinity for a number of naturally occurring variants of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription factor and comparing these values to the transcriptional activity in cells, this project provides a framework for understanding allosteric signaling in proteins containing ID. The resulting experimental data will be used to construct a quantitative, predictive model of allostery. The intellectual merits of the proposed activities are two-fold. First these studies provide the first systematic analysis of ID-mediated allostery using both biophysical studies and live cell assays of function. Second, these studies challenge a recently developed ensemble allosteric model designed to quantitatively characterize allostery in terms of the intrinsic stabilities of cooperative elements of structure and the interaction energies between them. As such, this research represents an advance over previous qualitative and largely speculative models for ID function, and provides one of the first quantitative descriptions of how and why proteins use intrinsic disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project are two-fold, and focus on research, education and the bridge between these two activities. First, the primary goal of the research is to experimentally determine the allosteric control present in GR. However, GR shares architecture with the estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), androgen (AR), and vitamin D (VDR) receptors, all of which play a vital role in hormone-dependent cell signaling and regulation. As such, insights gained from the current research will directly impact understanding in these other systems. Second, a key objective of the research is to derive a quantitative model that is subject to simulation and validation. As part of two previous NSF proposals, the Principal Investigator has developed a significant amount of computer-based course work focuses on modeling of dynamic biological systems. The models developed as part of the current research will be directly integrated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum at Johns Hopkins University, and thus will not only play a vital role in the education of biology students, it will significantly expand the biology students? access to computational methods and technologies.",

For more than 60 years, the field of protein science has understood signaling to be facilitated through the use of structured proteins; a structured potein molecule binds its partner and changes shape so that its affinity for a second target molecule will be either increased or decreased.  Our work shows for the first time that disordered proteins can also signal.  This is completely counter to he classic structural model of proteins.  In addition we showed that molecules that control whether genes are turned on or off function by simultaneously activating and repressing function. In fact we showed that the molecule under investigation, Glucocorticoid receptor, actually contains two functionally distinct parts, an activation domain and a varaible length repressor domain.  The glucocorticoid receptor  modulates its overall activity by changing the size of the repressor domain, thus changing the degree of repression.  This is an entirely novel regulatory mechanism that may be at play in multiple transcription factors.  Indeed, for glucocorticoid receptor the different lengths of the repressor domain are facilitated by alternative translation start sites in the disordered regions, suggestive of the fact that the disorder I required for the different couplings between regions.  This is important because it has also been shown that disorder is hyper abundant at intron-exon boundaries, suggestive of a similar mechanism to control the coupling between functionally distinct disordered domains.  This opens the possibility that the mechanism we have uncovered in glucocorticoid receptor may be generally used across all families of transcription factors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent J Hilser"
