 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to determine the link between topographic uplift, erosion and exhumation, pre-existing geologic boundaries, and the underlying mantle dynamics that drive deformation.  The field area is the Salmon River suture zone of western Idaho, which is the boundary between Precambrian North America underlying most of Idaho and younger (Phanerozoic) accreted terranes of the Blue Mountains in Oregon.  The Idaho batholith formed exclusively on the North American side of this boundary.  Post-collision and ongoing deformation affect different parts of the region differently, representing differences in pre-existing geologic structure and/or in deep driving forces. The timing, rates, and amounts of uplift of the various mountain ranges will be related to the current subsurface geometry -- determined using seismic data -- to identify motions in the Earth?s crust and mantle that elevated topography on regional scales.  The work entails a combination of seismic data analyses, to provide a detailed sub-surface architecture, and thermochronology, to determing the timing of uplift and exhumation of rocks from depth and the development of the current topography.\r\n\r\nThe work spans three main study areas and includes a final project synthesis:  1) Documentation of the exhumation path of the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith to determine if it was uplifted by younger magmatism; 2) Evaluation of potential differential exhumation along the trans-Challis fault zone that cross-cuts the Idaho batholith; and 3) Documentation of exhumation in the Blue Mountains, in order to compare its history to that of adjacent North America.  A particular focus is whether the Salmon River suture zone was reactivated by post-Columbia River Basalt extension. The combination of the thermochronology and seismic results with recent geology, geochronology, and geochemistry studies will allow synthesis of a regional tectonic evolution and can illuminate the relationship between inherited lithospheric structures and active tectonic processes.\r\n\r\nTwo graduate and two undergraduate students at the University of Florida and Virginia Tech are directly supported by this work.  Tectonic synthesis will involve graduate students at all three institutions, several of whom are funded by other sources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant follows up on a larger EarthScope multi-disciplinary project investigating the ancient margin of the North American continent against which plate tectonics has accreted the younger terranes of Oregon.  Earlier work had shown that this boundary had been steepened in the upper crust, but modified by younger tectonic events (magma and extension).  This grant was for the continued analysis of a large controlled-source seismic dataset acquired from central Oregon to eastern Idaho across this suture.  The grant also included funds for data synthesis with other geology, geochemistry, and geophysics studies. \n\nAnalysis of the controlled-source seismic data shows that the ancient continental margin is near-vertical through the entire crust, and offsets the Moho.  This result contradicts previous models.  This steep margin acted as a primary control over the manifestation of later tectonic magmatism and extension, and persists after those events. \n\nThinner crust in eastern Oregon has been underplated by magmatism associated with the extensive Columbia River basalt volcanism.  Thicker crust of the Idaho Batholith and ranges to the east have a more silica-rich composition, and show no distinction between the batholith and the older continent that it melted and into which it intruded. \n\nData acquisition involved a 53-person field crew composed largely of undergraduate and graduate student volunteers from 22 colleges and universities.  About 20 of these students were recruited from non-research and minority-serving universities, where students do not typically have access to field research opportunities.  Undergraduate interns assisted with initial data analysis.  A Ph.D. student has been analyzing and interpreting the data as part of her studies. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John A Hole"
