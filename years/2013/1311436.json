 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important discoveries from the rise of genomics is that animals, despite their staggering differences in shape and size, utilize a common set of genes.  How does the incredible diversity of animal forms arise if animals all contain the same core genetic code?  There is a growing body of evidence that changes in the time, location, and amount of gene expression is responsible for the evolution of structures.  This project is aimed at determining how regulation of gene expression may have influenced the defining feature of limbs, which is the presence of the hand.  Fish do not possess hands, but they possess all of the genes necessary to build one.  Thus, the goal of this project is to identify the gene regulatory elements in zebrafish that drive gene expression in fins, and compare them to their counterparts in mouse.  This knowledge will help us understand what aspects of fish fin development are ancient, and what aspects have evolved to be specific for building a hand.  \r\n\tAs the hand is a ?new? feature of limbs that is not present in fins, this project will shed light on how novel features may originate during the evolutionary process.   Investigating how genetic switches have influenced the fin to limb transition may provide a general model for how complex and unique features of animals have arisen. In addition, this project is collaboration with a lab in Seville, Spain.  This type of collaboration between institutions is beneficial to the greater scientific community by promoting exchange of ideas and techniques in genetics, especially as genomics gets further integrated into evolutionary biology.  \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt has long been known that limbs are modified fins, yet the bones of these two structures look very different.  In particular, there is no obvious counterpart to the wrist and digits in fish fins.  We sought to use molecular and developmental biology to understand how the structures of fins are related to those of limbs.  Mouse limbs are built by two \"phases\" of Hox gene expression.  The first phase builds the arm and the forearm, while the second phase builds the wrist and digits.  While fish show similar patterns of gene activity in fins, these patterns could have arrived independently in fish genomes.  To determine if Hox patterns are equivalent in limb and fin development, we sought to understand the regulatory networks that activate Hox genes.   By using cutting edge genome-wide technologies combined with a new model fish system, the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), we found that the regulatory networks that activate Hox genes are equivalent in fins and limbs.  These results suggest that fish genomes have the regulatory architecture to produce the wrist and digits, and that the small nodular bones at the edge of the fin are at some level equivalent to those of the mouse hand.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew R Gehrke"
