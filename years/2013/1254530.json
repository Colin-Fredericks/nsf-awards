 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: The research aim of this CAREER project is to understand the photo-physics and spin-physics of single point defects in ZnO as a platform for quantum information science and quantum-enhanced metrology. While quantum information science promises fundamentally new technological capabilities, implementation of these theoretical ideas in a physical system is very challenging. Single point defects in semiconductor crystals are promising quantum systems with potential for scalability through integration with conventional computing technology and other quantum systems. This research project studies point defects in ZnO using a \"single-molecule\" approach, combining confocal fluorescence microscopy, time-resolved single-photon counting, and magnetic resonance to understand the structure and dynamics of this individually addressable quantum system. Emphasis is on understanding spin and photo dynamics with an eye toward controlling the quantum states of electronic and nuclear spins, and on the generation of high-quality single photon sources. In addition, ZnO growth is studied, both in the principle investigator's laboratory and through collaboration, to understand and control the formation of defects and how they interact with the electronic and photonic properties of ZnO.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: This project examines the optical and magnetic behavior of single atom-scale defects. An example is a single missing atom within the array of atoms that form a crystal. Such defects can behave like single atoms, even at room temperature, within a solid-state environment. Understanding and controlling these point defects could lead to new technology for computing and communication because their behavior is governed by quantum mechanics. The research team studies a single defect through its optical signature by detecting the individual photons it emits under different experimental conditions and in samples grown using different methods. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project benefit from research experience in a stimulating and interdisciplinary environment. The principal investigator (PI) also develops hands-on science lessons, including equipment and supplies that may be borrowed by teachers through the Cornell Center for Materials Research lending library.  The PI works with teachers on the development of these kits, and brings teachers into the laboratory so they can experience scientific research and share it with their students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on understanding the properties of atomic defects in semiconductors for quantum applications.  Isolated defect-centers in semiconductors can behave as a solid-state version of a single atom, complete with the ability to emit single photons ? which is a useful resource for future quantum communication technologies. \n\nThis project?s starting point was the optical properties of single defect centers in zinc oxide.  The research team prepared zinc oxide samples containing a single optically active defect center within the microscale volume of a focused laser beam.  By collecting light emitted by a single defect center and analyzing its properties (rate of emission, color, and polarization), the researchers were able to establish a model of the defect center?s electronic states.  Going further, the team repeated these experiments on many individual defect centers to distinguish which properties are intrinsic to the defect center and which are modifications of its properties due to variations in its local environment. \n\nThis project also investigated isolated defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride using a similar approach.  The team?s work revealed large variations in the color of light emission from different isolated defect centers; a finding that is still under study from research groups worldwide.  Hexagonal boron nitride defects were found to be bright and stable relative to other semiconductor defect centers, which is promising for single photon source technology.  Additionally, the team studied how the variation in the optical wavelength (color) varies with temperature and could be related to thermal vibrations of the hexagonal boron nitride lattice.  Finally, the team studied the mechanisms of optical absorption and emission of light and how that process is also related to lattice vibrations.  These findings provide basic understanding of a technologically interesting defect center for quantum technologies.\n\nAnother important aspect of this project was the training of graduate and undergraduate students in quantum information science research.  Quantum information technologies is a rapidly developing area that will require a well-trained workforce.  The project also enabled training opportunities for elementary school students through the development and use of a hands-on science kit that teaches data collection, plotting and hypothesis testing.  This helps to address the next generation science standards.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory D Fuchs"
