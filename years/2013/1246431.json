 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new observations of iron layers, neutral temperatures, and gravity waves up to 155-km altitudes with the Fe-Boltzmann lidar (deployed at McMurdo in 2010) have opened a new door to explore the Antarctic neutral thermosphere. These measurements of neutral-ion coupling and Joule heating, in the critical region above 100 km, are an objective of highest priority for the upper atmosphere science community. Development of the neutral atmosphere temperature climatology is crucial for calibrating satellite observations of the polar mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) region and validating global climate models; in decades from now this climatology records will serve as the baseline against which long-term temperature trends in the changing Antarctic climate are assessed. The studies of extreme summertime Fe events and solar effects on Fe-layer's bottom side are improving the understanding of iron chemistry at polar latitudes. The vertical heat and constituent flux observations with the lidars are enhancing the knowledge of wave-induced transport in the polar mesopause region and remove the greatest source of uncertainty in current chemical-dynamical models of the mesospheric metal layers. This also led to improvements in quantitative estimates of the cosmic dust input that has implications for a variety of geophysical processes throughout the Antarctic atmosphere and Southern Ocean. The characterization and analysis of the gravity wave field in the neutral atmosphere above McMurdo are advancing the understanding of wave coupling in the MLT region and provide better constraints on wave parameterization schemes in climate models. Thus, the McMurdo lidar campaigns provide a new look into the composition, chemistry, temperature, and dynamics of the polar upper atmosphere in a critical latitudinal gap region mid-way between the South Pole and Antarctic Circle. The Fe-Boltzmann lidar has already produced a rich dataset stored in the CEDAR/Madrigal database, which is readily available to other scientists to help supporting their own research on polar aeronomy and climate. This project provides exceptional opportunities to train students and young researchers by giving them fieldwork experience in Antarctica. The project also enhances classroom teaching and graduate programs at several prominent universities around the world.",
