 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nThis NSF-GOALI project brings together leading researchers in nanomagnetism from New York University and IBM with the aim of furthering the understanding of the physics of spin-transfer and applications of spin-transfer to high performance devices. Spin-transfer is a mechanism by which a spin-polarized current can reverse the magnetic orientation of a nanomagnet and induce magnetic excitations such as spin-waves. This is an exciting development that will very likely enable dramatic improvements in magnetic information processing and storage. This is because spin-transfer offers a mechanism for rapidly reversing the magnetization of nanomagnets with large magnetic anisotropy that would otherwise require huge local magnetic fields -an achievement critical to increasing magnetic information storage density. However, as nanomagnets are reduced in size their magnetic moments become more susceptible to reversal due to random forces associated with thermal and electrical noise. An understanding of the effects of noise on spin-transfer driven magnetization dynamics is thus critical. This project will advance understanding of spin-transfer physics through experimental studies of individual nanomagnets excited by spin-currents, including a new research direction that will use spin-currents generated through excitation of ferromagnetic insulators. These experimental studies will be conducted in concert and guided by a theoretical analysis of noise-induced transitions in the presence of spin-transfer torques. The theoretical analysis will focus on new phenomena generated by the interaction of a nongradient deterministic dynamics with random forces. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nThis project brings together leading researchers from New York University and IBM with the aim of furthering the understanding and application of nanometer scale magnetic devices and materials. Magnetic nanostructures are widely used in technology with the most advanced applications found in information processing. This is a huge industry in the United States that is growing rapidly, with the ever-increasing worldwide demands for data processing and storage. It has been discovered that in miniature magnetic devices a direct electrical current can switch the direction of magnetization by a mechanism known as spin-transfer. This is an exciting development that may enable dramatic improvements in magnetic information processing and storage. There are important and fundamental questions about the nature of the interaction between the current and magnetization that this project will address through studies of individual magnetic nanostructures excited by spin-currents using unique high frequency measurement techniques. This research will be integrated with the training of young scientists in this forefront area of magnetism research. Participating graduate and undergraduate students will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through exchanges between NYU and IBM. Their education will be enriched through exposure to a variety of perspectives, expertise and techniques present in an industrial setting. High school students will also participate in this research.",
