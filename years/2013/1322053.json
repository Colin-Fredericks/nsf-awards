Findley\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the University of Miami; namely a new trawl block, water weights, a computerized maintenance system, and a bow thruster evaluation study.  These items will either improve safety or enhance the vessel?s science support capabilities.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises.  The WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete approximately 120 NSF sponsored days in 2013.",
