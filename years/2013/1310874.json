 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern biology was founded on Charles Darwin?s principle of ?descent with modification?. Closely related species share similarities in size, shape, and form of their body plans. However, in some cases, distantly related species also share similar traits. This exception to Darwin?s rule has puzzled biologists and raises the question: to what extent is evolution repeatable and predictable? This project will address this fundamental question by examining an interesting pattern of repeated evolution in turtles. Some distantly related turtle species feature similar anatomical modifications that allow them to close their shells when attacked by predators. The project will employ leading-edge molecular biology techniques to determine whether this pattern requires similar changes in genes that control embryonic development of bone tissues in these species. \r\n\r\nTurtles are of high cultural and economic importance to societies worldwide. Yet, they are one of the most imperiled animals on the planet. This multidisciplinary project will train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to improve knowledge and raise public awareness about turtle diversity and conservation. This knowledge may also contribute to improving human bone health. Research materials will be available to the public through museums and online databases. Results will be disseminated broadly to K-16 and public audiences.",

This ecological diversification is reflected in the remarkable shell variation of living turtles, suggesting that processes governing the formation of the turtle body plan have evolved.\n\n            As part of our study, we conducted one of the most species-comprehensive examinations of turtle development.

Already, we have donated samples of species that are rare in nature or of conservation concern to various museum collections in the United States. These specimens, as well as genetic data generated by this study are available to other researchers via publicly available databases. Moreover, we continue to use specimens prepared in this study to expose K-16 and lay audiences to the astounding diversity of turtle forms.\n\n..."
