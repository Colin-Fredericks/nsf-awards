 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is to investigate the yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in an environmental chamber as a function of VOC/NOx levels and oxidant exposure. SOA formed from the OH oxidation of organic precursors happens mostly during the daytime. However, NO3 radicals are abundant at night. These elevated NO3 levels can also coincide with elevated levels of VOCs/IVOCs due to lower nighttime boundary layer heights, which may result in significant nighttime SOA formation. The chamber results will be used to model the underlying oxidation mechanisms and to relate them to atmospheric photochemical processes.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide new insight into the formation of secondary organic particles in the atmosphere and the oxidative aging of these particles. The results are important for understanding how aerosols influence the cooling and heating of the atmosphere and alter climate.",

Our NSF project focused on laboratory studies of atmospherically relevant carbon-containing particles (i.e., organic matter and black carbon) to further understanding of our atmosphere and to enhance our predictive abilities for understanding how our climate will change in the future.  We developed and applied new technologies for generating organic particles, which account for a significant fraction of atmospheric particles\u00c6 mass loadings, from solar light initiated gas-to-particle reactions.  These laboratory studies provided measures of the chemical composition and mass yields of organic particles as a function of gas phase emissions, such as biogenic emissions from plants and anthropogenic emissions from internal combustion engines, and as a function of pre-existing particle chemistries (i.e., common atmospheric inorganic matter).  Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques developed at Aerodyne Research, Inc. with Boston College participation, including aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) and chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), we characterized the molecular composition of these organic particles and are working towards the capability for full carbon closure (i.e., measuring all carbon-containing compounds).  The chemistry of organic particles further our understanding of the processes that control atmospheric formation of organic particles and their measured mass yields are used in climate models for predicting organic particle loadings.  In collaboration with multiple national and international collaborators, we investigated the phase state (i.e., liquid or solid) of these organic particles, their capacity to absorb gas-phase water under high relative humidity conditions, their viscosities and the rate of internal water diffusion, all of which govern the ability of these organic particles to form cloud droplets.  Finally, we developed and applied new technologies for studying the chemical, optical, and morphological (i.e., shape) of black carbon particles (i.e., soot particles) generated from a methane flame.  We organized and hosted a multiple institute study on the effects of atmospherically relevant organic matter on the absorption of solar light by black carbon particles, which is a function of particle size, chemistry, and shape.  These measurements inform climate models about the direct effect that combustion engines have on global climate.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Davidovits"
