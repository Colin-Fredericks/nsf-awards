 "awd_abstract_narration": "The archaeology of early urbanism provides deep historical context for an increasingly urbanized world.  Dr. David M. Carballo and Dr. Kenneth G. Hirth will direct a collaborative three-year project involving an international team of interdisciplinary researchers at the ancient city of Teotihuacan, Mexico.  During its height in the early first millennium AD Teotihuacan was the largest city in the Americas and one of the largest in the world.  Today, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most visited ruins in the Americas, Teotihuacan is of great interest to a broad audience. \r\n\r\nThough Teotihuacan is famed for its high-level of civic planning, cosmopolitan populace, and broad economic reach, such issues require more intensive investigations within understudied portions of the city.  Investigations of this project focus on the Tlajinga district, a cluster of neighborhoods to the south of Teotihuacan that was inhabited by a lower socioeconomic stratum of the city's populace, was the locus of intensive utilitarian craft production, and is bisected by the terminus of the city's central artery named the Street of the Dead by the later Aztecs.  The Tlajinga district provides an opportune setting for examining issues of broad interest to social and behavioral sciences and represents a minimally explored portion of the city whose archaeological record is threatened by contemporary urbanization surrounding greater Mexico City.  To date, only one of approximately 90 apartment compounds - the multi-family residential complexes of Teotihuacan - has been excavated.  \r\n\r\nResearch goals of the project scale from the level of the household to the level of the urbanization of the city as a whole.  One household activity of particular interest is the production of obsidian blades - the utilitarian cutting implement of the period - in one compound, and its implications for the organization of markets and interregional exchange.  This compound will be excavated and the obsidian acquisition, production, and distribution system will be analyzed technologically and geochemically.  At the district level, a complex consisting of likely temples around a plaza will be studied for a better understanding of administrative and religious activities that connected neighborhoods and articulated them with the urban fabric of the multi-ethnic city.  And at the level of the entire city, excavations at the unexplored southern Street of the Dead will address when it was established and the degree of centralization involved in this major act of urban planning. \r\n\r\nResearch methods of the project include two seasons of horizontal excavations at three compounds and along the southern Street of the Dead; analysis of activity areas coupling floor-chemistry analyses and micromorphological studies; detailed materials analyses, including the technological sequence of obsidian-blade production; isotopic analysis of bones and geochemical analyses of artifacts; and extensive surface mapping and remote-sensing programs for neighborhood-scale spatial analyses.  The project involves close collaboration between researchers from the US and Mexico as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students from these two countries.",

During its apogee (ca. 1-550 CE), Teotihuacan was the largest city in the western hemisphere; it is also currently a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is visited by millions of tourists annually.&nbsp; Some of the urban characteristics that make Teotihuacan stand out for early cities are (1) the intense amount of craft production and exchange evidenced by artifacts from the site; (2) the fact that most of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants lived in large, multi-family apartment compounds&mdash;possibly unique for the pre-modern world; and (3) its highly planned layout along an orthogonal plan tethered to a central artery called the Street of the Dead by the later Aztecs.&nbsp; The current project focused on the Tlajinga district, a southern cluster of neighborhoods (Figure 1), was directed by David Carballo (Boston University), Kenneth Hirth (Penn State), and Luis Barba (Mexico&rsquo;s National Autonomous University, UNAM) with goals of addressing all three of these characteristics.</p>\n<p>Major project initiatives included two seasons of excavations at apartment compounds and along the southern Street of the Dead and the mapping of the entire district (approximately 1 km<sup>2</sup>) using digital topography, photogrammetry, and geophysical prospection, undertaken over four different seasons (Figure 2).&nbsp; Material science applications included study of the chemistry of living floors and human bones, sediment micromorphology, and detailed AMS radiocarbon dating&mdash;this last making the Tlajinga district one of the best dated parts of Teotihuacan.&nbsp; Investigations were collaborative and involved students and faculty from the US, Mexico, and Germany.</p>\n<p>Results of the project included the detailed documentation of a large obsidian workshop at apartment compound 17:S3E1 (Figure 3).&nbsp; Obsidian was one of the major commodities at Teotihuacan, as in the absence of metals it was used for most cutting activities.&nbsp; Compound 17 is the first obsidian workshop of its kind to be subject to detailed excavations and analyses, and shows that inhabitants of the periphery of the city could specialize in utilitarian forms of production in order to access other commodities that circulated within the urban and interregional economies.&nbsp; Excavations at a second apartment compound, Compound 18:S3E1 (Figure 4), were aimed at investigating the central courtyards, since these are locations where group activities including domestic rituals took place.&nbsp; These excavations also recovered deep stratigraphic deposits that permit us to understand the chronology of construction in the area, and how apartment compounds emerged as an urban housing type from smaller and simpler houses, made of perishable materials.&nbsp; Finds at both compounds included imported items, such as marine shell, or more elaborately manufactured objects, such as a sculpted stone face and finely painted ceramics.&nbsp; These attest to the level of access that Tlajinga&rsquo;s occupants had within Teotihuacan&rsquo;s economy, whereas their peripheral location in the city and more simply constructed homes denotes their common or working-class status. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the broader levels of the district and city as a whole, results of the project demonstrate how a formerly more rural area became part of an urban periphery.&nbsp; This included the extension of the city&rsquo;s central artery, the Street of the Dead, southward through the district, where excavations and micromorphology of sediments show that hard volcanic tuff substrate was cut approximately 40 m wide for over 500 m (Figure 5).&nbsp; This would have therefore represented a major urban expansion project that necessitated the coordination of hundreds of people in the district, whereas the placement of apartment compounds and the construction of relatively simple retaining walls next to the Street of the Dead indicates the operation of more local labor efforts in infilling the urban landscape.</p>\n<p>Project results are relevant to broader study of the global history of urbanism, now the dominant settlement type on the planet.&nbsp; They have and are continuing to be disseminated widely through academic and popular publications, through involvement of project collections in a major museum exhibit set to tour the US beginning in fall 2017, and through multi-media efforts including video and radio podcast on NSF sites, with a few links below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://science360.gov/obj/video/44bbe233-9c0c-4762-9716-bfbe52e16354/lessons-teotihuacan-beyond-pyramids\">https://science360.gov/obj/video/44bbe233-9c0c-4762-9716-bfbe52e16354/lessons-teotihuacan-beyond-pyramids</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://science360.gov/radio/episode/04d08d07-ead0-4c89-b072-816d9c0ef5b5/new-nsf-podcast-dig-archaeologist-david-carballo-describes-life-working\">https://science360.gov/radio/episode/04d08d07-ead0-4c89-b072-816d9c0ef5b5/new-nsf-podcast-dig-archaeologist-david-carballo-describes-life-working</a></p>\n<p>Finally, the project involved close international collaboration between researchers in the US and Mexico, as well as training and early career development for women and underrepresented minorities in science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Carballo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321247/1321247_10250844_1497207875090_Carballo_etal_Fig1_min--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321247/1321247_10250844_1497207875090_Carballo_etal_Fig1_min--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321247/1321247_10250844_1497207875090_Carballo_etal_Fig1_min--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of the ancient city of Teotihuacan, Mexico, with detail of the Tlajinga district.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David M.
