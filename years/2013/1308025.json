 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This project will establish the scientific and technological foundations for texture ratchets as a microfluidic platform for low-cost, parallel handling of droplets. Since their invention in the PI?s lab, we have shown that texture ratchets can perform the essential tasks of droplet generation, transport, splitting, merging, mixing and sorting, all without electric fields, pressure gradients or pumps. We hypothesize that we can extract a wealth of information by observing the dynamics of texture ratchets, starting from the phase lag of droplet oscillation to the intricate motion of the solid-liquid-vapor line along the droplet footprint. The impact of this research will span from a deeper understanding of the physical interactions between liquids and nano-structured surfaces to diagnostics on novel portable devices.\r\nIntellectual Merits: Despite decades of research in wetting phenomena and microfluidics, recently there have been dramatic new insights from interdisciplinary efforts by physicists, nanofabrication engineers and developers of biomedical instruments. This project will establish a comprehensive model of texture ratchets and validate it on newly designed devices. Specifically, we will explore texture ratchets as a low-cost microfluidic platform and develop applications for the biomedical arena. \r\nBroader Impact: This research sheds light on the behavior of water at the micro- and nano-scale that is relevant well beyond surface physics and nanofabrication, with applications from self-cleaning surfaces to desalination systems. The PI will be involved in activities to connect advanced research to a wider audience: Within UW, he helps establishing an interdisciplinary ?Undergraduate Minor in Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering.? Beyond UW, he hosts classes from North Seattle Community College in UW cleanrooms, participates in MESA outreach programs for K-12 underrepresented minorities, and gives hands-on demos at the Pacific Science Center.\r\n",

This system provides for droplet transport through a microfabricated surface pattern and applied orthogonal vibrations. The surface pattern consists of a track of curved rungs that pin, or apply a sort of friction force to, the leading edge more than the trailing edge of the droplet, a result of droplet&rsquo;s innate curvature. The vibrations cause the edges of the droplet to oscillate or expand and contract. The movement of the droplet edges, combined with the asymmetry of pinning forces, provides a net force, essentially causing the droplet to take a step through each vibration cycle (Figure 1). In this work, we created a mechanical model of the droplet, representing key components (leading edge, trailing edge, and bulk volume) as a mass connected by springs and dampers that represent the surface tension and viscous character of the liquid (Figure 2). Simulation results from this model showed good agreement with data from experimental results. We also performed a thorough investigation of the effect that substrate design and vibrational parameters had on droplet transport, regarding efficiency and velocity (Figure 3). These findings provided new insights to the ARC system, but also expanded the knowledge base of fluid and droplet mechanics. We used this information to expand the functional capacity of the ARC system, developing new devices that can selectively pause droplet transport to control timing and synchronization (Figure 4) and select the direction of droplet transport (Figure 5) based solely on the parameters of the applied vibration. Finally, we began development of a prototype that utilizes this ARC technology to automate a DNA amplification test for conservation biology. This prototype consists of disposable chips that are operated by a field-deployable driving unit (Figure 6). This device will provide customs and enforcement officials and agents of conservation a tool to determine if wildlife products were sourced from an endangered or illicit species.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/13/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karl&nbsp;F&nbsp;Bohringer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
