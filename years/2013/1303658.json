The project will obtain a new set of interferometric radar images of F-region irregularities and analyze them to determine the spatial distribution of scattering structures within the radar beam, to identify \u00a0patterns or periodicities related to underlying plasma waves, and to quantify the correlation between ESF structures and clusters of bottom-type irregularities. The project will fine-tune an interferometric system to study scattering structures with zonal scale sizes of several kilometers or more, and the project will focus on structures having scale sizes less than a few tens of km, for which few investigations have been conducted to date.",

The ionosphere is characterized by a high density of free ions and electrons produced by solar photo-ionization. These free electrons, combined with the Earth&rsquo;s geomagnetic field, produce a medium that has a complicated index of refraction, which affects the propagation of radio waves used for communication, remote sensing and global positioning and navigation. Large perturbations in the ionospheric electron density and, therefore, in the index of refraction, are observed at low latitudes and cause even more difficulties for the propagation of radio waves. Despite being known for tens of years now, we still seek a better understanding of the underlying sources and causes of day-to-day variability of the low-latitude ionospheric perturbations (also known as equatorial spread F or ESF). Advances in our understanding of ESF are, at least in part, limited by our observational capabilities at low latitudes. In order to better understand ESF, this project collaborated with the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research &ndash; INPE to use measurements of ESF made by a ground-based ionospheric radar located in the equatorial region. We used the radar measurements with advanced imaging techniques to produce two-dimensional (2D) images of ESF structures and to investigate how these structures relate to current theories of ESF development. Figure 1 shows an example of 2D images of ESF obtained from the radar measurements. The left-hand side panel shows the radar echoes (height versus time) caused by ESF perturbations. The right-hand side shows the 2D image (height versus East-West distance) derived from the measurements (at 22:30 local time), which shows the spatial distribution of the ESF irregularities. We also combined radar measurements with satellite observations to understand the underlying conditions leading to ESF development and suppression. The project advanced our understanding of precursors of ESF development. In addition to advancing our understanding of ESF, the project also provided training for Physics graduate students, and opportunities for undergraduate students to be involved with research in space sciences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/11/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Fabiano&nbsp;Rodrigues</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1303658/1303658_10033110_1444608045319_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1303658/1303658_10033110_1444608045319_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1303658/1303658_10033110_1444608045319_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Left: Radar measurements of echoes caused by an equatorial spread F (ESF) event.
