The biggest roadblock to making scalable the sun-light powered synthesis of carbonaceous fuels from CO2 and water is the lack of a catalysts which is simultaneously efficient, cheap, and environmentally benign. The development of such a catalyst is hindered by the infancy of the mechanistic understanding of the proton-coupled multiple electron transfers involved into the CO2 reduction beyond CO and formate. The proposed interdisciplinary research will bridge this knowledge gap by systematically studying for the first time copper and iron sulfide minerals as novel and cheap photocatalytic materials. A novel molecular cocatalytic approach is suggested to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction towards energy-dense fuels. The objective is to determine the mechanisms of the reaction dependence on molecular cocatalysts at the interfaces and in bulk electrolyte, with the ultimate goal to develop more sustainable and efficient photosynthetic systems. Towards this ambitious goal, a team from Columbia University will study for the first time the multiscale physics and chemistry driving artificial photosynthesis of carbonaceous fuels by iron and copper sulfides, using advanced operando FTIR and Raman spectro-electrochemical, (photo)electrochemical, and theoretical (e.g., Density Fuction Theory) methods. \r\n\r\nThe new more efficient photosynthetic systems based on copper and iron sulfides developed during the research will be a practical step towards scaling up renewable energy. It will lead to novel scalable strategies for the rational design of the interfaces of metal sulfides with water. Apart from artificial photosynthesis, this outcome can find application in immobilizing radionuclides in environmental remediation, as well as in mineral processing (selective separation) of sulfide minerals, in the design of greener chemicals. In addition, this knowledge will broaden our understanding of biogeochemical process including processes in acid-mine drainage, cycling of iron and cupper in deep oceans, and eventually the origin of life. The general results of the research and the new methodology will be included in the PI's undergraduate/graduate level courses.",

A particular interest to this reaction has been ignited by realization of its potential in the on-going shift from fossil fuel to clean renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal). Indeed, this energy is intermittent and hence has to be stored. As compared to the more evolved alternatives?hydrogen and batteries?CO<sub>2</sub>-derived fuel is energy denser and cheaper. &nbsp;The CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction technology can also sustain manned Mars missions by supplying fuels and chemicals (CO<sub>2</sub> makes 95% of the Martian atmosphere).</p>\n<p>However, a commercially viable catalyst for CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction is yet to be developed.

It can bind to a catalyst surface O-down, C-down, O,O-down, and C-O down.

This result is of the paramount importance because the first reaction intermediate controls the reaction products (selectivity) and their energy costs (energy efficiency). Hence, armed with this knowledge and computational power, researchers are now able to predict CO<sub>2</sub> activation on different catalysts and specify the most promising ones, which opens up an exciting possibility to rationally control this reaction.

Moreover, Cu is the only catalyst that can effectively synthesize energy dense fuels such as ethylene. However, its overall electrocatalytic performance is plagued by low selectivity and energy efficiency. In addition, Cu is not robust. Its surface corrodes (changes due to dissolution-reprecipitation/recrystallization). In addition, its catalytic sites are poisoned by strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates and heavy metal contaminants of the electrolyte.
