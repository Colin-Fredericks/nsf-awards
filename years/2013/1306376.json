 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a three-year research program focusing on the study of the electro-weak structure of the nucleon using the electron beam at Jefferson Lab (JLab) as a probe. The medium-energy nuclear experimental program conducted by the PIs aims to obtain information which will help to answer the questions: \"What is the internal landscape of the nucleon?\" and \"What are the key ingredients of a New Standard Model of particle physics?\".  The research program builds on the PIs previous work on the QWEAK and DVCS experiments and one of its highlights will be data taking on one of the first experiments of the JLab 12 GeV era. The goal of DVCS experiments is ultimately to provide a simultaneous spatial and momentum mapping of the internal structure of the proton.  Roche is a co-spokesperson of two experiments dedicated to the study of GPDs in Hall A at JLab, one of which is scheduled to take data as early as 2014. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the program is precision measurement of interactions which can be reliably predicted by the Standard Model, for example the measurement of the rate of parity violation in electron scattering.  The PIs will continue their data acquisition and analysis software work up to publication of the results of the completed QWEAK experiment and prepare for the next generation of such experiments at JLab: the MOLLER experiment.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the program are twofold: training the next generation of scientists and raising the profile of minority scientists. The research proposed by the PIs is performed in part by two graduate students. In addition, the PIs will carry out projects in which undergraduate students can meaningfully participate. Finally, this award supports the research of a woman physicist whose residence on campus and mentoring activities serve to support and encourage graduate and undergraduate women in physics.",
