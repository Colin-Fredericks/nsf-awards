 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computing revolution began over two thousand years ago with the advent of mechanical devices for calculating the motions of celestial bodies. Sophisticated clockwork automata were developed centuries later to control the machinery that drove the industrial revolution, culminating in Babbage's remarkable design for a programmable mechanical computer. With the electronic revolution of the last century, the speed and complexity of computers increased dramatically. Using embedded computers we now program the behavior of a vast array of electro-mechanical devices, from cell phones and satellites to industrial manufacturing robots and self-driving cars. The history of computing has taught researchers two things: first, that the principles of computing can be embodied in a wide variety of physical substrates from gears to transistors, and second, that the mastery of a new physical substrate for computing has the potential to transform technology.  Another revolution is just beginning, one whose inspiration is the incredible chemistry and molecular machinery of life, one whose physical computing substrate consists of synthetic biomolecules and designed chemical reactions.  Like the previous revolutions, this \"molecular programming revolution\" will have the principles of computer science at its core.  By systematically programming the behaviors of a wide array of complex information-based molecular systems, from decision-making circuitry and molecular-scale manufacturing to biomedical diagnosis and smart therapeutics, it has the potential to radically transform material, chemical, biological, and medical industries.  With molecular programming, chemistry will become a major new information technology of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThis Expeditions-in-Computing project aims to establish solid foundations for molecular programming.  Building on advances in DNA nanotechnology, DNA computing, and synthetic biology, the project will develop methods for programmable self-assembly of DNA strands to create sophisticated 2D and 3D structures, dynamic biochemical circuitry based on programmable interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and integrated behaviors within spatially organized molecular systems and living cells. These architectures will provide systematic building blocks for creating programmable molecular systems able to sense molecular input, compute decisions about those inputs, and act on their environment. To manage system complexity and to provide modularity, the project will establish abstraction hierarchies with associated high-level languages for programming structure and behavior, compilers that turn high-level code into lists of synthesizable DNA sequences, and analysis software that can predict the performance of the sequences.  This will allow molecular programmers to specify, design, and verify the correctness of their systems before they are ever synthesized in the laboratory. In addition to these software tools, the project will study the theory of molecular algorithms in order to understand the potential and limitations of information-based molecular systems, what makes them efficient at the tasks they can perform, and how they can be effectively designed and analyzed. Putting the products of this fundamental research to the test, the project will pursue real-world applications such as molecular instruments for probing biological systems and programmable fabrication of nanoscale devices.\r\n\r\nThis project will expand the network of scientists and engineers working in molecular programming by building a diverse community of students, teachers, researchers, scientists, and engineers. This community will be fostered through the creation of publicly accessible software tools, courses, textbooks, workshops, tutorials, undergraduate research competitions, and popular science videos to teach the principles and methods of molecular programming and to engage young researchers and the public in this exciting new field. Industrial partnerships with relevant biotechnology and other high-tech companies will ensure fast transfer of knowledge generated into real-world products.  Perhaps most importantly, as molecular programming becomes a widespread technology, it has the potential to transform industry with new complex nanostructured materials, to transform chemistry with integrated and autonomous control of reactions, to transform biology with advanced molecular instruments, and to transform health care with more sophisticated diagnostics and therapeutics.",

Inspired by how biological organisms have explored the potential of information-based chemistry, molecular programming takes a fundamental approach to how information can be stored in molecules and how that information can direct chemical processes algorithmically -- thus exploring a design space for information-based molecular systems that in principle goes well beyond what is seen in modern biology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The accomplishments of our team of 11 faculty and their research groups at 4 institutions can be illustrated by a sampling of prominent publications. Biomolecular design begins with the principle that, in RNA and DNA and proteins, the polymer sequence determines its structure and its function. Thus, knowing the right information (the sequence) is often enough to get enzymes to synthesize a new molecular machine. &nbsp;We demonstrated a new level of understanding of the folding process for designed RNA molecules that can fold into compact target shapes while they are being synthesized, and then go on to self-assemble into sheets (Geary, Rothemund, and Andersen, Science, 2014). Using DNA structures known as DNA origami, we integrated top-down lithography with bottom-up molecular self-assembly in order to precisely position individual molecules on a silicon chip (Gopinath et al, Nature, 2016). Exploiting our understanding of the dynamics of RNA folding, we implemented complex Boolean logic computation within single molecules inside a living cell (Green et al, Nature, 2017). &nbsp;To demonstrate that single molecules can be designed to sense, compute, and act, we created teams of DNA robots that sort molecular cargo on a 100 nanometer DNA origami field (Thubagere et al, Science, 2017). As an example of a general theory for systematic construction of arbitrary chemical reaction network dynamics, we built the first enzyme-free biomolecular oscillator (Srinivas et al, Science, 2017). &nbsp;Bringing our control over molecular self-assembly to a new scale, we designed an 8000-pixel DNA \"canvas\" large enough to draw (a low resolution copy of) the Mona Lisa but small enough to fit within a square micron (Tikhomirov, Petersen,and Qian, Nature, 2017). Going into three dimensions, we mastered the design of DNA \"bricks\" to create structures as complex as a (sub-micron) teddy bear that self-assembles from 30,000 distinct DNA molecules (Ong et al, Nature, 2017). &nbsp;Beyond structure being determined by information, molecular interactions can perform information processing tasks, as exemplified by a DNA neural network that classifies 10x10 images of digits encoded as concentration patterns (Cherry and Qian, Nature, 2018). &nbsp;Finally, integrating structural and algorithmic aspects of molecular function, we demonstrated a reprogrammable self-assembly system that computes as it grows -- loosely analogous to developmental programs that control biological morphogenesis (Woods et al, Nature, 2019).</p>\n<p><br />Underlying these and other achievements is a computer science approach to molecular design founded on a deep understanding of molecular biophysics and rising through a hierarchy of abstractions to (relatively) high-level programming langauges for molecular systems. Particularly notable is the NUPACK software suite for the analysis and design of multistranded RNA and DNA, incorporating decades of measurements of nucleic acid secondary structure thermodynamics on top of which are built sophisticated sequence design algorithms (Wolfe et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2017).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have applied this understanding to build molecular instruments and tools that put new capabilities into biologists' hands. &nbsp;The hybridization chain reaction has been refined over three generations to provide multiplexed fluorescence imaging of intact biological samples with impressive sensitivity and precision -- essentially exploiting a molecular program for spatially-localized amplification (Choi et al, Development, 2018). &nbsp;DNA PAINT uses programmable DNA interactions to provide a powerful spectrum of programmable super-resolution optical microscopy methods that have demonstrated sub-10-nanometer resolution (Jungmann et al, Nature Methods, 2014).</p>\n<p><br />One of the challenges to the growth of molecular programming as a field is how deeply multidisciplinary it is: the greatest progress is made when a single researcher has depth in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, materials science, and electrical engineering. Annual molecular programming workshops have proven to be one of the high points for intellectual exchange and community building -- a nexus for inspiration and mentoring. &nbsp;We are especially proud of the undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs who have come through our laboratories as part of this Expedition in Computing, and many of them have now started their own research groups at top universities around the world. &nbsp;By organizing and hosting the annual biomolecular design competition for undergraduates, BIOMOD, we have also helped open the eyes of the next generation to the possibilities of programmable molecular systems engineering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/04/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erik&nbsp;Winfree</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1317694/1317694_10281098_1591321849039_Molecularprogrammingwall-goldcolour-noshading-wide--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1317694/1317694_10281098_1591321849039_Molecularprogrammingwall-goldcolour-noshading-wide--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Collage of atomic force microscope images of self-assembled DNA ribbons carrying algorithmic patterns.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1317694/1317694_10281098_1591321849039_Molecularprogrammingwall-goldcolour-noshading-wide--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of atomic force microscope images of self-assembled DNA ribbons carrying algorithmic patterns.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each ribbon was seeded by a DNA origami labeled with a barcode identifying the algorithm and input.

Beyond structure being determined by information, molecular interactions can perform information processing tasks, as exemplified by a DNA neural network that classifies 10x10 images of digits encoded as concentration patterns (Cherry and Qian, Nature, 2018).  Finally, integrating structural and algorithmic aspects of molecular function, we demonstrated a reprogrammable self-assembly system that computes as it grows -- loosely analogous to developmental programs that control biological morphogenesis (Woods et al, Nature, 2019).\n\n\nUnderlying these and other achievements is a computer science approach to molecular design founded on a deep understanding of molecular biophysics and rising through a hierarchy of abstractions to (relatively) high-level programming langauges for molecular systems. Particularly notable is the NUPACK software suite for the analysis and design of multistranded RNA and DNA, incorporating decades of measurements of nucleic acid secondary structure thermodynamics on top of which are built sophisticated sequence design algorithms (Wolfe et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2017). \n\n \n\nWe have applied this understanding to build molecular instruments and tools that put new capabilities into biologists' hands.  The hybridization chain reaction has been refined over three generations to provide multiplexed fluorescence imaging of intact biological samples with impressive sensitivity and precision -- essentially exploiting a molecular program for spatially-localized amplification (Choi et al, Development, 2018).  DNA PAINT uses programmable DNA interactions to provide a powerful spectrum of programmable super-resolution optical microscopy methods that have demonstrated sub-10-nanometer resolution (Jungmann et al, Nature Methods, 2014).\n\n\nOne of the challenges to the growth of molecular programming as a field is how deeply multidisciplinary it is: the greatest progress is made when a single researcher has depth in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, materials science, and electrical engineering. Annual molecular programming workshops have proven to be one of the high points for intellectual exchange and community building -- a nexus for inspiration and mentoring.  We are especially proud of the undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs who have come through our laboratories as part of this Expedition in Computing, and many of them have now started their own research groups at top universities around the world.  By organizing and hosting the annual biomolecular design competition for undergraduates, BIOMOD, we have also helped open the eyes of the next generation to the possibilities of programmable molecular systems engineering.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erik Winfree"
