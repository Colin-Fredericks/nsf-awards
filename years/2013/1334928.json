 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract***\r\nThis project seeks to exploit recent advances in synthesizing nanoporous materials via a building-block approach to conceive, synthesize, characterize, and test new heterogeneous catalysts that exhibit enzyme-like control in demanding chemical transformations. Catalytically active metal nanoparticles will be encapsulated within metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals. MOFs are nanoporous materials synthesized in a building-block approach from metal nodes and organic linkers. Enshrouding metal nanoparticles within MOFs prevents their agglomeration and allows control over reactant access to their surfaces. Molecular-level modeling will guide the selection and synthesis of appropriate metal surfaces and MOF channels for an important class of reactions. The objectives of this project are 1) to develop new ways of synthesizing heterogeneous catalyst materials with structural control ranging from the atomic level to the particle level and 2) to demonstrate how new levels of synthetic control, combined with predictive molecular-level modeling, can drastically decrease the development time of new catalytic materials. Through this combination of modeling and experiment, the project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the role that the MOF layer plays in defining and modulating the catalytic behavior of nanoparticles. The result should be a class of catalysts that are both highly active and selective. The proposed research will serve as an excellent training platform for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow in the critical frontier of structure-based catalyst design. Web-based education and outreach activities will reach a wider audience.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nCatalysis is the science and engineering of making chemical reactions go faster and more selectively toward the desired products.  Catalysis is a fundamental technology for our country's manufacturing base, and recent advances in nanotechnology, computational power, and our theoretical understanding of catalytic reactions create tremendous opportunities to improve catalysis, producing both economic and environmental benefits.  This project aims to design new catalysts for an important class of chemical reactions known as selective oxidation.  Catalytically active metal nanoparticles will be encapsulated within metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals. Enshrouding metal nanoparticles within MOFs prevents their agglomeration and allows control over reactant access to their surfaces.  However, there are an enormous number of metal nanoparticle and MOF types that could be chosen.  Molecular-level modeling will, therefore, guide the selection and synthesis of appropriate metal surfaces and MOF channels so that the resulting materials have the desired properties. The objectives of this project are 1) to develop new ways of synthesizing heterogeneous catalyst materials with structural control ranging from the atomic level to the particle level and 2) to demonstrate how new levels of synthetic control, combined with predictive molecular-level modeling, can drastically decrease the development time of new catalytic materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project brought together chemists and engineers to develop new materials for catalysis, which is the science and technology of making chemical reactions go faster and more selectively toward the desired products.  Catalysis is a fundamental technology for our country?s manufacturing base, and recent advances in nanotechnology, computational power, and our theoretical understanding of catalytic reactions create tremendous opportunities to improve catalysis, producing both economic and environmental benefits.  This project focused on the design of new catalysts for an important class of chemical reactions known as selective oxidation. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe main research platform was to encapsulate catalytically active metal nanoparticles (NPs) within nanoporous metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals. We demonstrated that enshrouding metal nanoparticles within MOFs prevents nanoparticle agglomeration and allows control over reactant access to the NP surface.  In particular, we showed that the NP@MOF system could be engineered so that for a reactant molecule with two reactive sites, only the site near the end of the molecule (but not the site near the middle of the molecule) could react.  The MOF seems to prevent the reactant molecule from lying down flat on the NP surface (where both sites would react), and only the end of the molecule can access the catalytically active NP surface.  The exact nature of the NP/MOF interface is critical, but difficult to probe with standard characterization techniques.  To overcome this problem, we used a combined experimental and modeling approach.  In particular, we found that measurement of the infrared frequencies of adsorbed CO, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, provided new and useful insights about the NP/MOF interface.\n\nAnother challenge for NP@MOF catalysts is that there are an enormous number of combinations of metal nanoparticles and MOFs that could be chosen.  To help guide this selection, we developed two molecular-level modeling tools.  First, we developed a way to perform quantum mechanical calculations of reactions in these systems.  Because of the large number of atoms involved, normal methods would not work, so we proposed and tested a simple way of representing the MOF pores that captures the essential steric effects of the pores but allows the calculations to be performed in a reasonable amount of computer time.  Second, we developed a method for generating new MOFs on the computer in an automated way.  With this method, we generated over 13,000 proposed MOFs and &ndash; as a test &ndash; assessed their potential application for separating or storing gases.  For example, we found a number of MOFs that are promising for storing hydrogen gas (which might be useful in fuel cell vehicles).  Some of the proposed MOFs had a rare topology, and with experimental collaborators, some of these new MOFs were synthesized.  When their hydrogen uptake was measured, it agreed very well with the predictions from modeling.  Finally, we also showed using experiment and modeling that MOF framework topology can have a significant effect on catalytic reactions. \n\nBroader Impact\n\nCatalysis is a fundamental technology for our country?s manufacturing base, and this project explored a new approach for improving the selectivity of catalytic materials. The project also served as an excellent training platform for 2 undergraduates, 4 graduate students and 2 post-doctoral fellow in the critical frontier of structure-based catalyst design. These students gained research skills and experience in the art of interdisciplinary research through collaborative exchanges between research groups in the areas of synthesis, modeling, and catalysis. In addition, an educational website describing energy topics for a general audience was updated as part of this project and reached an audience of over 50,000 people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall Q Snurr"
