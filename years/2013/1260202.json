 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minneapolis Community and Technical College, a uniquely diverse and urban Minnesota college, is providing a pathway to student success in science and technology through the MCTC Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars (S-STEM) program.  This program helps create a more diverse, better-prepared STEM professional community by enabling not only eligible underrepresented, underserved students to succeed in science and technology, but also by enabling other high achieving students to further their education.\r\n\r\nPrevious NSF awards at MCTC have a strong history of student success; 89% of students participating in the S-STEM program graduate, transfer to a baccalaureate program, or are on track for graduation or transfer.  This new support is enabling the institution to strengthen and improve its efforts by stepping up recruiting, serving more students, creating alumni support group and incorporating new campus resources.  Improved recruiting strategies include leveraging digital resources, student clubs, and campus events concurrently to increase the pool of qualified applicants.  New campus resources to be incorporated include integrated advising, tutors linked to courses, new student interest groups in STEM, and the MCTC Undergraduate Research Initiative.\r\n\r\nThe MCTC S-STEM project is creating a more diverse, better-prepared STEM professional community by enabling academically talented, financially needy students to succeed in science and technology.  The creative and successful design of this project is based on combining scholarship monies with peer cohort and faculty mentoring support. The commitment of accomplished faculty from STEM disciplines, relevant administrators, financial aid staff, and student support staff, as well as top-notch facilities, support services, long-standing connections with baccalaureate institutions, and outstanding contacts in the local STEM industry make the program sustainable. Furthermore, the MCTC S-STEM Scholars program is also serving first-generation students, low-income students, students of color, and other high achieving students. In so doing, it is helping to prepare a diverse, well-qualified workforce that can strengthen both the regional and global economy. The results of MCTC S-STEM are reported via the MCTC website and faculty presentations at local and national conferences.  The program is also leaving a lasting legacy by creating a network of program alumni to support STEM students, by increasing the diversity of students earning degrees in STEM fields, and by enhancing support services that benefit future generations of STEM students.",
