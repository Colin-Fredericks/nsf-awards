Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with Purdue University as the lead institution. \r\n\r\nThe two products of this proposed center will be physical research results advancing process understanding and improvement, and human resources supplying the next generation of casters and researchers. The work proposed for this center is a uniquely well-integrated mix of experimental and numerical work, examining continuum phenomena coupled across length scales from the submicron to several meters. Research into a variety of casting processes is planned, with a mixture of bench-top experiments, plant trials, and numerical simulations. The center will encompass three main program areas: investment casting, continuous casting, and electro-slag and vacuum arc re-melting processes of wrought alloys. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will yield technical advances across large segments of the metals processing industry, as well as aircraft and land-based turbine engine development, bolstering US competitiveness in manufacturing. Expected impacts include: higher productivity and lower defect levels in large-scale steel production, higher efficiency gas and steam turbine engine designs, with associated reductions in emissions, for industrial and transport applications enabled by advanced alloy processing developments, and improved alloy and product quality across multiple manufacturing sectors. The proposed center will also have a strong emphasis on career development for graduate students, research experience for undergraduates, and advancing diversity goals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF project aimed to investigate the merits and to  plan the formation of a site of a new NSF Industry / University Cooperative  Research Center \"I/UCRC\" on \"Solidification Processing\" at Purdue University (as lead insitution), in joint collaboration with a site at the University of Illinois, based in their Continuous Casting Consortium.  Purdue University is the home of the Purdue Center for Metal Casting Research (PCMC) and the University of Illinois Department of Mechanical Science  and Engineering has been the home of the \"Continuous Casting Consortium,\" (CCC)  since 1991; these centers would form the new I/UCRC.  The CCC has sustained a successful collaboration with industry for  over 20 years.  Each of the 10 member companies currently contributes about the  same as the NSF I/UCRC grant amount each year.  The PCMC is relatively newer and has much less formal structure.\n\nThe new I/UCRC was envisioned to merge these centers and the the CCC, would  focus  solely on ferrous continuous casting research and the Purdue site would  conduct research into related nonferrous processes.  It was envisioned that the two existing centers would benefit by formalizing the collaborations already being conducted among  researchers at them, the new Purdue site would benefit from the  experience of the CCC, and new members would be attracted due to increased  interest in both sites. \n\nContacts were made and meetings were held with several  prospective I/UCRC member companies, including both current CCC members and  prospective new companies.  The directors and administrators of several existing  centers, University personnel and NSF personnel were interviewed, in order to  investigate center structure and operation.  A tentative member agreement was  drafted. Several new research projects were proposed.  Further research was  conducted into the rules of NSF centers, and the PIs participated in a NSF  I/UCRC Boot Camp.  Many companies expressed interest. \n\nAfter careful deliberation, the potential drawbacks to the UIUC site were perceived to outweigh the potential benefits.  Thus, the final outcome of this investigation was not to proceed with the formal meeting and proposal to create the joint I/UCRC on Solidification Processing at Purdue and UIUC at this time.  Most of the funds from this planning grant are being returned to NSF. \n\nA more positive outcome was establishing a closer relationship between researchers at Purdue and Illinois.  In addition, of the many companies visited and contacted during this proposal / planning grant, a new member company joined the CCC and three companies have started new projects with the PCMC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew John M Krane"
