Climate-change-induced extreme events are expected to affect the region's ecosystems and ecosystem services, with impacts on social and economic well-being. Despite mounting evidence of the severity of these issues, knowledge is limited and fragmented about how the climate, ecological, and social systems interact as coupled systems. The re-eutrophication of Lake Erie illustrates the complex interactions among natural and human systems, and points to the challenge of managing this resource effectively and adaptively. In the GL region, agricultural production and land use change are major drivers of water quality, and extreme weather events can influence the choice of agricultural practices. For example, larger storm events can increase use of tile drains or prolonged drought can increase adoption of irrigation. Land use practices also interact with extreme weather events to impact water quality. For example, increasing intensity of spring storms and their timing relative to fertilizer application has been hypothesized to change the ratio of dissolved reactive phosphorus to total phosphorus in runoff, impacting Lake Erie phytoplankton communities. Through these and similar feedbacks, climate-change-induced extreme events may cause as yet unpredicted impacts to the GL ecological and socio-economic systems. These changes, in turn, might feedback on the region's climate, driving further system changes. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposal asks: \"What are the possible effects of climate-changed-induced extreme events on water quality and ecology in the Great Lakes system, and what management strategies will be effective in addressing these changes?\" The complex, co-evolving human and natural systems in the GL region create the need for a paradigm shift in the study of water quality. Accordingly, they will address this question, with a focus on the climate-sensitive western basin of Lake Erie, through the lens of Sustainability Science, which provides a framework in which each sub-system can autonomously change through time while interacting with other sub-systems. In applying this framework, they will develop models, analysis, data, and information to better understand interactions among the physical, biological, social, and economic systems, and to explore and inform potential governance system responses to these changes. They will create new knowledge both within the individual components (physical climate, eco-hydrological, socio-economic) and through synthesis of these components. The physical climate component will investigate extreme-event precipitation formation and the role of land-use/lake/atmosphere feedbacks through a combination of climate and event-based simulations. The social and economic components will study the implications of climate-change-induced adaptations in human migration and agricultural production for spatial land use patterns and land markets. The eco-hydrological component will move beyond the traditional notion that freshwater eutrophication is driven by total phosphorus loads, and explore how the climate / extreme-event / land-use interactions enhance delivery of more biologically active phosphorus forms. To further understand GL water quality issues, the relative effects of phosphorus loading versus invasive species in the re-eutrophication will be examined.\r\nThe governance component will innovate by gauging how integrated knowledge may change decision-makers' perceptions of available institutions and tools, and what they might need to design new ones. The components will inform one another through model-based interactions, and the outcomes of the modeling activities will be used to further understand opportunities and constraints in governance systems. By using the paradigm of sustainability science to propose a framework for the integrated study of water systems, the framework, methods, and many results will be transferable to other problem settings and locations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Their results will advance the scientific understanding of coupled human-climate-water quality systems, and inform and influence decision-making in the Great Lakes region. They will promote training, teaching, and learning by integrating research into K-12 education through the Investigate the State (ITS) and Michigan Sea Grant (MSG) programs, and will broaden participation of underrepresented minorities through inquiry-based study at the Ypsilanti New Tech High School. Broad dissemination will also occur through publication of research results, and through creation of educational and professional development resources via the ITS and MSG programs. The eco-hydrological and socio-economic components will build on existing networks, and closely involve watershed councils and government agencies. They will train five graduate students and two postdoctoral scholars, with specific attention to mentoring postdoctoral scholars and training graduate students in an integrated interdisciplinary context.",

Climate-change-induced extreme events affect the region?s ecosystems and ecosystem services, with impacts on social and economic well-being. Despite mounting evidence of the severity of these issues, knowledge about how the climate, ecological, and social systems interact as coupled systems is limited. The re-eutrophication of Lake Erie illustrates the complex interactions among natural and human systems, and points to the challenge of managing this resource effectively and adaptively. The viability and economic success of the region are both affected by, and an important determinant of, water quality in the GL basin.  In this project, we proposed to examine the potential impacts and feedbacks among climate, the economic and governance structures that influence human behavior and organizations, the hydrologic system controlling water quality, and the ecological response to the sum total of the changes caused by these interacting systems. \n\n \n\nWe asked: What are the possible effects of climate-change-induced extreme events on water quality and ecology in the GL system, and what management strategies would be effective to address these changes?\n\n \n\nSpecifically, we examined the expected impact of climate-change-related extreme events on nutrient loading to the GL, under land-use patterns altered as a result of agricultural and demographic responses to climate change, and their impacts on ecological responses in the lakes.  The ecological focus was on Lake Erie, especially the lake?s western basin, which is particularly sensitive to climate drivers, to take advantage of extensive ongoing data collection and research efforts already being carried out by the research team.  We also explored the development of governance and management systems that are robust and support adaptation in this context.  We examined the physical processes that affect present-day and future precipitation in the region, including understanding the interactions between the land, lake and atmosphere and its role in the intensity, duration and timing of precipitation events.\n\n \n\nThe overall scientific goals of this project were (1) to enhance understanding of expected impacts of climate-change-induced extreme events on water quality and ecology, with the GL, and Lake Erie specifically, as a case study; and (2) to develop a framework for integrating human and biogeochemical controls on water quality, ecology and climate that transcends and integrates across social, economic, ecological, hydrological, and geosciences perspectives. \n\n \n\nThe broader impacts, outreach, and education components of the study were centered around (i) promoting teaching, training and learning through integration of climatological and ecological research into K-12 science education, (ii) broadening participation of underrepresented groups through a pilot program with the Ypsilanti New Tech High School, (iii) developing educational and professional development resources to enhance scientific and technological understanding, and (iv) delivering benefits to society through the scientific impact of the conducted research and direct involvement of watershed councils and government agencies in the project. \n\n \n\nAt its completion, the project had advanced the state-of-the-science in a number of areas, with contributions broadly falling under the following themes:\n\nImproved understanding of processes controlling nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) inputs into the Great Lakes in general, and Lake Erie in particular, including the influence of land management (including agricultural practices), meteorology, anthropogenic nutrient addition to soils, land use, and climate change;\nImproved understanding of nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) limitations on harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie;\nImproved understanding of circulation and stratification in Lake Erie and their role in the formation of harmful algal blooms and hypoxic dead zones;\nImprovements in approaches for tracking harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, including innovations in both in situ and remote sensing capabilities;\nThe development of models for identifying controlling processing for, and projecting the magnitude of, annual Lake Erie HABs and hypoxia;\nThe documentation and analysis of extreme water quality events in Lake Erie, including the 2011 record HAB and the 2012 record hypoxic dead zone;\nImproved understanding of the interactions between the impacts of human action at regional (e.g. land management, agricultural) and global (e.g. climate change) scales on eutrophication and associated water quality impacts;\nImproved understanding of regional meteorological and climate feedbacks and surface-atmosphere interactions on precipitation;\nImproved approaches for the evaluation and bias correction of climate models;\nThe development of strategy for effectively engaging with stakeholders for identifying improved approaches to nutrient management.\n\n\n \n\nThe project has thus far yielded over forty publications in scientific journals, including in Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
