 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Gregory Tochtrop from Case Western Reserve and colleague Blanton Tolbert will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen cooled broadband X-detect probe and an automated sampling system. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of the catabolic fate of lipid peroxidation products; (b) NMR detection of RNA structures and protein-RNA contacts involved in viral replication; (c) studies of mechanically enhanced polymers; (d) advanced functional materials based upon organic conjugated polymers and molecules; (d) protein stability, structure, and dynamics; (e) interlocked polymeric architectures; (f) mechanisms by which enzymes are activated during signal transduction pathways; (g) characterization of conjugated molecules and polymers; and (h) design and characterization of fluoro-aromatic analogues of human insulin.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research of students in the departments of Chemistry, Biology, Polymer Science & Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. The instrument will enhance the research and teaching capabilities of the greater Cleveland scientific community with web-based scheduling and cyber-enabled data delivery/processing for off-site users.",
