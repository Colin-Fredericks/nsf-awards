This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get together.  Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power. \r\n\r\nIn addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This provides the students with information on research developments and on how that research is relevant to operations.",
