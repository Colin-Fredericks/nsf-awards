 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deposition of atmospheric nitrogen provides reactive nitrogen species that influence primary production in nitrogen-limited regions.  Although it is generally assumed that these species in precipitation contributes substantially to anthropogenic nitrogen loadings in many coastal marine systems, its biological impact remains poorly understood.  Scientists from Pennsylvania State University, William & Mary College, and Old Dominion University will carry out a process-oriented field and modeling effort to test the hypothesis that deposits of wet atmospheric nitrogen (i.e., precipitation) stimulate primary productivity and accumulation of algal biomass in coastal waters following summer storms and this effect exceeds the associated biogeochemical responses to wind-induced mixing and increased stratification caused by surface freshening in oligotrophic coastal waters of the eastern United States.  To attain their goal, the researchers would perform a Lagrangian field experiment during the summer months in coastal waters located between Delaware Bay and the coastal Carolinas to determine the response of surface-layer biogeochemistry and biology to precipitation events, which will be identified and intercepted using radar and satellite data.  As regards the modeling effort, a 1-D upper ocean mixing model and a 1-D biogeochemical upper-ocean will be calibrated by assimilating the field data obtained a part of the study using the adjoint method.  The hypothesis will be tested using sensitivity studies with the calibrated model combined with in-situ data and results from the incubation experiments.  Lastly, to provide regional and historical context for the field measurements and the associated 1-D modeling, linked regional atmospheric-oceanic biogeochemical modeling will be conducted.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  Results from the study would be incorporated into class lectures for graduate courses on marine policy and marine biogeochemistry.  One graduate student from Pennsylvania State University, one graduate student from the College of William and Mary, and one graduate and one undergraduate student from Old Dominion University would be supported and trained as part of this project.",

How fast this algae is being produced is generally dictated by the availability of light and of nutrients. In the North Atlantic Ocean, one of the main nutrients, nitrogen, is present in only very low concentrations during the summer. The algae is thus 'nitrogen-starved' in this particular period, leading to relatively low productivity. However, certain areas of the western North Atlantic are positioned downwind of large industrial and agricultural centers. These are known to be significant sources of nitrogen that is released to the atmosphere and carried eastward by the dominant winds before falling back to the surface of the water (FIGURE-1). This latter process, called &ldquo;deposition of atmospheric nitrogen&rdquo;, has the potential to &ldquo;fertilize&rdquo; regions where nitrogen is limited and thus enhance algal production. The increased production can be beneficial or detrimental depending on location. In oceanic waters, the increase could offset part of the carbon dioxide released by human activities. In shallow near-shore waters the increase can generate low oxygen \"dead zones\" that could suffocate fish and other aquatic life. The actual importance of atmospheric nitrogen deposition remains poorly known because deposition events are naturally episodic and spatially 'patchy', making it challenging to directly measure them. The present award relied on numerical models of the US east coast to simulate the impacts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition over multiple years and to complement the sparse measurements available. The first part of the award focused on the surface waters of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and the second part focused on the Chesapeake Bay.</p>\n<p>A high-resolution dataset of atmospheric nitrogen deposition was obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency and was implemented in numerical models of the US east coast. The dataset confirmed that substantial amounts of nitrogen are transported by the dominant winds and released at the surface of the water all along the US east coast (FIGURE-1). However, the study identified a number of processes that mitigate the impacts of this deposition. First, the deposition reduces the amount of nitrogen being transferred from the deep nutrient-rich water to the surface. Second, the increases in algal concentrations at the surface can 'block' some of the sunlight and thus negatively affect algal production below the surface. Despite these mitigating processes, atmospheric nitrogen deposition yields a substantial increase in algal production and concentrations at the surface during the summer. Chlorophyll concentrations (equivalent to algal concentrations) notably increase by 25-30% inside a 'hotspot' located next to the Gulf Stream (FIGURE-2). The results confirm the view that atmospheric deposition has a substantial impact on the marine ecosystem of this region.</p>\n<p>The second part of the study focused on the Chesapeake Bay, a region experiencing very low levels of oxygen (a phenomenon called hypoxia) at the bottom of the Bay during the summer period (FIGURE-3, LEFT). The study compared the effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition with two other sources of nitrogen: the nitrogen carried by rivers, and the nitrogen that flows from the continental shelf into the Bay. All three nitrogen sources can affect hypoxia by influencing how much algae is produced and subsequently decomposed, with decomposition being responsible for consuming the oxygen dissolved in the water. The comparison between the three nitrogen sources reveal that atmospheric deposition has about the same gram for gram impact on Chesapeake Bay hypoxia as the riverine source. The impact of deposition on hypoxia is largest in the shallow near-shore regions, riverine nitrogen has a dominant impact in the largest tributaries and the middle Bay, while the nitrogen originating from the continental shelf is most influential near the mouth of the Bay (FIGURE-3, RIGHT).</p>\n<p>Broader impacts: The results from the award were disseminated in two scientific articles with one published in 2017 and the other one currently under review for Journal of Geophysical Research.
