PACAM will facilitate the exchange of information on contemporary aspects of applied mechanics and its technological applications in a unique setting that is perhaps the only one in the world that explicitly brings together researchers from South, Central, and North America. The 13th PACAM is being held in the US for the first time.  \r\n\r\nPACAM will host tutorial sessions in contemporary topics in applied mechanics that will be especially valuable for early-career researchers.  The funds provided will support early-career researchers, and the conference organizers recruitment plan will emphasize students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM.  A special journal issue will be pursued to publish the results of this conference in a high-quality and visible venue.",
