 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the travel of 10 graduate students and 2 postdoctoral students from U.S. institutions to the SIGCOMM 2013 conference.  The ACM SIGCOMM 2013 Conference will be held between August 12 and August 16, 2013, in Hong Kong.  ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communications, a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery.  SIGCOMM is a very highly selective (<14%), high-quality conference sponsored by the ACM.  The conference is a major forum for presentation and discussion of important research results in networking.  Recipients of the travel grants will be selected via a widely advertised competitive process involving submitting a travel grant application and review by a travel grant committee associated with the SIGCOMM organization.\r\n\r\nThis project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications.  Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field.  The proposed student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the students' research interests and quality.  Second, the project will promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.  Furthermore, the truly international flavor of SIGCOMM as an annual conference is well-known and reflected in the composition of the Technical Program Committee (TPC) as well as in the authors of the submitted and accepted papers.  As such, it cultivates international research interactions and presents a tremendous opportunity to students to increase their breadth of ideas, research approaches, and technical perspectives.",
