 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long been puzzled about why there are so many species of trees in tropical forests; the answer is not obvious. Recent evidence suggests that disease microbes hidden in the soil may play an important role in determining how many species can grow in a given area. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis are lacking, though. This project employs a combination of experiments, plant pathology, and cutting-edge genetic approaches to test whether interactions between trees and disease agents in the soil determine tree species composition in tropical forests of Panama.  The study is unusual in the amount of detailed data collected on distributions, identities, and host specificity of many types of largely unknown pathogens.  \r\n\r\nChanges in species composition of soil pathogens as a result of human-caused disturbances and agricultural practices are well documented. However, the impact of such changes on land restoration is poorly understood. This study will provide critical insights to scientists as they search for more effective conservation and reforestation techniques.  Because this project is highly collaborative, it will also provide broad training to U.S. and Latin American students in the ecology of plants and microbes.  Finally, the lead scientists will work with the Missouri Botanical Garden to publically demonstrate the importance of soil microbes to the health and sustainability of both natural and agricultural plant communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report  \n\n \n\nLike many ecosystems around the world, tropical forests are faced with outside pressures that lead to loss of diversity and their important functions (e.g. maximizing diversity of animals, carbon storage, new medical discoveries, stabilizing climate fluctuations). Therefore, understanding the biological processes that maintain high plant diversity in nature systems such as tropical forests, remains a large goal in ecology.  Such knowledge is not only important to help predict the consequences due to loss of biological diversity over time, but lessons learned from uncovering these processes are directly transferable to insure successful and sustainable agricultural and conservation &amp; restoration outcomes. \n\n \n\nMany scientists argue that aboveground processes (e.g. herbivory, foliar disease, drought, disturbance, seed dispersal) are the key processes that maintain high plant diversity. However, we are beginning to uncover that interactions between plants and their specialized belowground enemies (e.g. root-associated fungal pathogens) play an important role in determining how many species are in a community, as well as why some tree species are common, while others are rare. The main goal of this NSF-funded project was to dig deeper and identify those soil-borne fungi that possess sufficient species-specificity required for the maintenance of tropical forest diversity, as well as to test whether these same fungi play a role in regulating tree species relative abundance.\n\n \n\nWe first conducted a series of field experiments where we planted tree seedlings under their own conspecific (same species) adults, and adults of other tree species.  Seedlings were then removed after 3 months in forest, and fungal strains associated with roots were cultured to determine their identities, level of host associations, and pathogen function.  We find that seedlings of different species, despite being grown in close proximity to each other, are infected by distinct groups of fungi, suggesting a large degree of host specificity.  Through follow-up experimentation assessing their function, we also find that many, but not all, of these fungi are pathogens and inflict damage to tree seedlings.  When we examined the community-wide effects of fungi, we find that they limit their own species? seedling performance relative to other seedling species, with the degree to which they do so being dependent on how common or rare that species is in the forest.  This self-suppression mediated by fungal pathogens is likely a contributor to maintaining the high plant diversity found in tropical forests as these pathogens prevent any one tree species from dominating the community.      \n\n \n\nThis study has led to research opportunities and training of 23 early career scientist, including 10 undergraduates, 1 high school teacher, 4 high school students, and 8 Panamanian technicians, 22 of which are underrepresented in science.   Further, biological resources obtained from this projected allow us to address previously unanswerable questions.  For example, we have established one of the largest collections of root-associated fungal species of tropical trees, many likely new to science.  With this live collection, we now have the ability to challenge trees with known fungal pathogens to determine the genetic mechanisms that underlie measured levels of host specificity, infection, and disease.  Such functional information is becoming increasing in demand for the development of better technologies to combat pests that threaten economically important agricultural crops.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A Mangan"
