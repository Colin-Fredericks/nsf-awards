 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the commercialization of a\r\nnew type of industrial refrigeration system for cooling raw milk in Indian villages, without the\r\nuse of backup diesel generators. The innovation lies in a novel thermal battery pack concept\r\ndeveloped by Promethean Power Systems with a Phase I grant from the National Science\r\nFoundation. The battery solves a chronic unreliable electricity problem by converting and\r\nstoring electrical energy in the form of thermal energy through a process of freezing and melting\r\na material. The battery needs just five hours of grid electricity to charge and, once charged,\r\nprovides constant cooling power on demand when the grid is off.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the introduction of clean energy\r\ntechnologies in refrigeration applications, eliminating costly spoilage of foods and providing\r\nclean energy alternatives to developing economies that currently rely on fossil-based fuels for\r\ntheir continued growth. In developing countries, billions of dollars of perishable foods are\r\nwasted annually because of inadequate cold-chain supply networks. A major obstacle in setting\r\nup a cold-chain network is the lack of reliable grid electricity to run refrigeration systems in\r\nvillages and farming areas. In such conditions, diesel generators are often used as backup, a nonideal\r\nsolution with high cost and environmental impact. Promethean?s thermal battery eliminates\r\ndiesel generators and makes village refrigeration systems economically viable. This could\r\nrevolutionize dairy industries around the world, especially in India, the largest producer and\r\nconsumer of milk in the world, where nearly 400 million people depend on milk for their daily\r\nprotein. Although Promethean?s first commercialization efforts are in India where thermal\r\nbatteries are needed the most, these efforts will benefit US economy by providing a large and\r\ngrowing market to US products and affirming America?s leading role in spreading innovative\r\nideas throughout the world.",
