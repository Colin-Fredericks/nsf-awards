 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop methods to fit time-varying non-Markovian multi-server queueing models to data from healthcare systems and customer contact centers, so that the models can be used to analyze and improve the performance; e.g., to set staffing levels. Complex models are needed because: the arrival rates typically vary significantly over time; there is often customer abandonment, which significantly alters performance; service times and customer patience times are usually not exponentially distributed; finally, service systems often need to be represented as a network of queues. Special attention will be given to stochastic variability caused by dependence in the arrival and service processes as well as non-exponential distributions and the time-varying arrival rates. Such dependence can be caused by network structure, including overflows from one queue to another when the first is congested, as occurs in the different wards of a hospital. The dependence (\"burstiness\") in overflow processes has been found to have a big impact upon performance in telecommunication networks. Estimation will be guided by many-server heavy-traffic limits, revealing key partial characterizations of the model needed to analyze and improve the performance.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide the basis for new methods and tools to fit stochastic models to service system data. These models will provide the basis for new methods and tools to design and manage large-scale service systems, such as healthcare systems and customer contact centers, for which there is a recognized need for new methods to improve capacity planning and operational control. The models are also relevant for many other applications, e.g., web server farms processing web-page requests, public housing authorities providing apartments to low-income tenants and financial back offices processing loan applications. Successful results can contribute to better ways to select capacity levels in design decisions and better ways to select staffing levels and to route and schedule customers in operational decisions. Nonstandard methods for treating time-varying arrivals are especially important when service times are relatively long, as in healthcare.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe efficiency of a service system, such as a hospital emergency department or a telephone call center, and the quality of service it provides are strongly affected by congestion, caused by unanticipated surges in demand and the unavailability of key resources.  Experience indicates that queueing models and analysis can help greatly in designing and managing service systems, but the service systems often exhibit features that go well beyond standard queueing models.  In particular, the demand often varies strongly over each day, while the service times often have distributions that are not nearly exponential.  As a consequence, the customary stationary Markov models are not appropriate.  The goal of this project has been to develop new better models for service systems and tools for fitting them to data and analyzing them.\n\nTo make significant progress in modeling and analyzing service systems, we need greater familiarity with the systems, which can be gained by close examination of system operation and system data.  At the same time, we need to develop new models and new modeling analysis tools.   We need to understand the systems and their data to understand how models can help.  At the same time, we need to understand what can be done with the models, so we know how to look at the systems and the system data.  Thus, the research conducted under this grant has been devoted to studying both service system data and service system models, with the aim of creating more effective models and performance analysis tools.  In particular, we studied service system data from a call center, two emergency departments and an endocrinology clinic.\n\nWe developed new ways to statistically test whether arrival data from a service system are consistent with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) and then applied the tests to data.  We obtained new insight into the power of these statistical tests (the ability to reject alternatives inconsistent with the NHPP hypothesis).  We found strong evidence of over-dispersion (more highly variable than Poisson) in call center data, but we also found strong evidence of under-dispersion in an endocrinology clinic, which has arrivals by appointment.  The actual arrival process at the clinic tended to be intermediate between the deterministic ideal for the appointment system and a Poisson process.  See the paper, \"Are Call Center and Hospital Arrivals Well Modeled by Nonhomogeneous Poisson Processes?\" Manufacturing and Service Operations Management 16 (2014) 464-480 with Song-Hee Kim.\n\nWe developed new two-time scale stochastic arrival process models to captures those phenomena.  The successive daily totals are modelled as a Gaussian process, while the arrival process within each day, conditional on the daily total is modeled as a conditional NHPP, with a rate determined by the arrival rate function.  The variance-to-mean ratio of the daily total captures the dispersion either over-dispersion or under-dispersion.  Thus, this model captures the time-varying deterministic rate during each day and the non-Poisson stochastic variability through the daily totals.\n\nWe also began investigating a new \"grey-box\" modeling approach to fitting queueing models to system data. Queueing theory primarily involves \"white-box? modeling, in which queueing models are defined from first principles and analyzed. To apply these models, we check that the assumptions of the models are satisfied, for example, by performing statistical tests on system data.  An alternative to white-box modeling of queueing systems is \"black-box\" modeling, in which models are employed, such as statistical time-series methods, without using any structure of queueing models.  Black-box modeling is growing in popularity as the amount of available data grows, as well as our ability to extract useful information from it.\n\nGrey-box modeling is an approach in between these two extremes, which might conceivably share advantages of both; it exploits some model structure together with learning from data.
