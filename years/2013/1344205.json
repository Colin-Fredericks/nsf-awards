This model plays a role similar to that of the Church-Turing model that underlies general computation. It describes part geometry and materials while connecting to the physics that underlies a part.  The computational model is necessary to embody complex information and enable new behaviors in ways that existing tools and technologies cannot accommodate.\r\n\r\nIn the new world of additive manufacturing, the central embodiment of an artifact, the thing that we buy and sell and improve, will be the information used to additively manufacture an object, not the object itself.  This project is developing a language in which to express that information, a language sufficiently rich and rigorous to unleash design capabilities and control manufacturing processes.  Development of such a language / model is a critical step to bringing the Maker culture into the economic mainstream.",
