 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate projections of future relative sea-level (RSL) rise are crucial for effective management of coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems including salt marshes. Sea-level reconstructions from the last 4000 years provide a context for understanding modern and projected rates of sea-level rise because Earth's climate system is relatively unchanged.  We will develop two new proxy RSL reconstructions from North Carolina to identify positive and negative departures from the perceived stability of sea level during the last 4000 years and support development of new predictive models in which the sea level-climate relationship can vary through time. The reconstructions will test the widely held assumption that sea-level rise from melting of large ice sheets was negligible during the last 2000 years and will help constrain rates of vertical land level movement. Data generated for the reconstructions will be used to further develop a model of salt-marsh response to sea-level rise that will provide a valuable service and tool to the coastal management community for informing policy decisions.  \r\n\r\nWhile there are compilations of global and regional proxy temperature data for the late Holocene, little is known about sea-level variability during this period and the response of sea level to known climate deviations such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and 20th century warming is unknown. Using foraminifera preserved in North Carolina salt-marsh sediments, we will produce the first continuous, high resolution (decadal and decimeter) RSL reconstruction spanning the last ~4000 years. The sea-level reconstructions will calibrate new predictive models of sea-level rise to improve the accuracy and regional validity of projections. The new record will extend existing reconstructions to test the following hypotheses that are vital for understanding the climate sea-level relationship: (1) regional RSL was stable before AD 1000; and (2) the contribution from melting of large ice sheets sea-level rise ended 2000 years ago. Reconstructions derived from salt marsh sediment also provide a paleo perspective for predicting the ecological effects of future sea-level rise. The proxy sea-level record will validate, for the first time, the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM). The MEM describes the regulation of salt-marsh vegetation by changes in sea level. If sea-level rise is faster than the rate of salt-marsh sediment accretion, the productivity of salt-marsh vegetation will decline, resulting in the degradation or loss of these important coastal ecosystems. The proxy sea level record will test a central premise of the MEM that (3) Stable sediment organic matter (SOM) concentration varies inversely with the reconstructed rate of RSL-rise.",

This goal required fieldwork to obtain deeper cores <em>(Image 1: field photo)</em>, and lab analyses to develop sea-level index points constrained by well-dated core chronologies. <strong>Goal 2</strong> was to <strong>provide new empirical sediment data with which to refine and adapt a numerical simulation model</strong> developed by co-PI Morris <strong>that predicts how marshes build upward in response to sea-level rise</strong>. To achieve our second project goal, undergraduate students working under Barber&rsquo;s supervision at Bryn Mawr provided over 1,500 new measurements of the bulk density and organic matter content of saltmarsh sediment samples from cores obtained during summer field campaigns.</p>\n<p>The major findings associated with each of our two main goals have been communicated to the scientific community by journal publications and numerous presentations by the PI&rsquo;s, postdocs, grad students and undergraduates at regional, national and international meetings. The PI&rsquo;s also have communicated these findings to the public through various means, including print, online, and broadcast media interviews, community meetings and panel discussions.</p>\n<p>The broader significance of the first research goal is an improved understanding of Late Holocene regional sea level variability and its relationship with climate change. The longer-term context provided by our extension of the high-resolution sea level record in North Carolina shows that the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century rates of relative sea-level rise are faster than at any time during the past 3,000 years. Although previous sea level research had found this to be true for shorter time intervals of the past, ours is the first with sufficiently high-resolution (both vertical and temporal) to make detailed comparisons between sea level and proxy records of the climate parameters (e.g., temperature) that may drive sea-level variability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our laboratory analyses of salt marsh sediment (Goal 2) allowed PI&rsquo;s Morris and Barber to develop an empirically validated, quantitative model that describes how tidal marshes build upward by accumulating a mixture of organic matter and mineral sediment. This marsh-sediment mixing model implies that tidal peatlands (e.g., saltmarshes) are unlikely to indefinitely survive under higher rates of sea-level rise unless the supply of mineral sediment to the marsh increases significantly. Application of the model to some of the North Carolina marshes we studied suggests these marshes already may be near their maximum steady-state vertical accretion rate. This finding pertains to the long-term sustainability of coastal marshes, which are important both as nursery habitats and also as sinks that sequester carbon within their sediments so long as they continue to keep pace with sea-level rise by building upward.</p>\n<p>These successful research outcomes were achieved in collaboration with co-PI&rsquo;s Horton (Rutgers), Culver (East Carolina University) and Morris (University of South Carolina), as well as post-doc Kemp (Yale and Tufts). Graduate students from Rutgers and ECU participated in fieldwork for the project. Funding for fieldwork allowed most of the undergraduates supported by the Bryn Mawr portion of the award to participate in multiple field campaigns with the co-PI&rsquo;s and the graduate students working with them. Undergraduates working with Barber at Bryn Mawr also joined the PI&rsquo;s for discussions while at national meetings and sometimes directly exchanged research results with the co-PI&rsquo;s via email. Five of the eight (8) undergraduate students supported by the Bryn Mawr portion of the award went on to complete year-long senior thesis research projects directly associated with the grant project.</p>\n<p>The high-level of research engagement (in field, lab and at meetings) among undergraduates and PI&rsquo;s, graduate students and postdocs made possible by the award appears to have yielded strongly positive outcomes in terms of the students&rsquo; trajectories in science beyond the undergraduate level:</p>\n<p>Of the eight (8) undergraduates whose research participation was supported by the Bryn Mawr portion of the award, seven (7) are women, and four (4) are US citizens who are members of minority groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.
