 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distributions of virtually all organisms are dictated by abiotic and biotic factors and dispersal or propagule pressure (number of individuals colonizing a non-native region). Nevertheless, there are few theoretical and empirical studies that a) simultaneously consider the impacts of these three processes on species interactions and distributions or b) investigate how the relative influence of these factors change across spatial and temporal scales. Host-parasite interactions are species interactions of particular concern because human and wildlife diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate. Funds are being provided to address this knowledge gap using a theoretical framework to test how spatial and temporal scales affect host-parasite interactions. Spatially, abiotic factors, such as climate, might be most important at large spatial scales, but biotic and propagule pressure factors might be more important at small scales where climate is generally more homogeneous.  Temporally, unpredictable climatic shifts, which are increasing with global climate change, might increase infections because parasites should acclimate to temperature shifts more quickly than their hosts due to their smaller sizes and faster metabolisms.  The overall goal of this grant is to use a combination of experiments, modeling, and local-to-global analyses to test these and other hypotheses for how spatiotemporal scales affect host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.  Amphibian-parasite interactions will be the model study system because there are several spatiotemporally-explicit datasets on amphibian distributions, amphibian pathogen prevalence, and pathogen-driven amphibian declines and extinctions.  The specific objectives are to:\r\nA.\tDetermine how the temporal scale of climatic shifts affects host-parasite interactions.\r\nB.\tEvaluate how spatial scale affects the relative importance of abiotic, biotic, and propagule pressure factors to host-parasite interactions.\r\nC.\tDevelop validated predictive models for extinction risk driven by climate change and disease.\r\n\r\nThis award will engage individuals of ethnicities or abilities that are under-represented in science and will broadly educate the public on the biology of environmental change, providing a positive legacy that will persist beyond its funding.  The proposed research will be thoroughly integrated with a new graduate course on the importance of spatiotemporal scales in ecology and will provide research opportunities for undergraduates that are female and of ethnicities or abilities that are under-represented in science. Additionally, in coordination with the Hillsborough County School District and the University of South Florida's College of Continuing Education, the research team will offer summer workshops (as continuing education credits) on the biology of environmental change for high school biology teachers.  At least one-half of the teachers will be chosen from schools with a primarily minority enrollment.  Finally, the scientific research itself will have widespread public benefits because it will enhance forecasts of the effects of natural and anthropogenic environmental change on disease risk across spatiotemporal scales.",

Our work identified non-amphibian hosts of this fungus, and elucidated how climate, vegetation, introduced hosts, trade, and host and pathogen thermal perfomances influence its spread.  This culminated in a model that used weather and climatic conditions, along with other factors, to successfully predict amphibian declines and extinctions in Latin America associated with this devastating disease, and a synthesis paper on the role of climate change in worldwide amphibian declines.  We also provided evidence of acquired resistance to both live and dead fungus, the precursor to a vaccine that could help curb these biodiversity losses.\n\nWe also conducted important non-amphibian work.  We provided models and syntheses on the drivers of thermal acclimation and breadth and phenological shifts of animals and their roles in coping with climate change.  We responded to the Zika outbreak by developing mechanistic models that derived predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we showed that these predictions were well matched by human case data.  We revealed the scale dependence of factors affecting parasite transmission to both humans and wildlife.  We revealed that at small spatial scales, biotic factors are most important to the spread of wildlife and zoonotic human diseases, but climate and human-related factors become more important at larger spatial scales.  More specifically, through a meta-analysis, we showed that at relatively small spatial scales, biodiversity can serve to reduce the risk of disease for wildlife and humans.\n\nThis project also had important broader impacts, including offering an improved understanding of factors affecting wildlife health and ecosystem services.  For example, we elucidated driver of amphibian declines and the roles of biodiversity and climate change mitigation in protecting against human diseases.  Additionally, this project trained &gt;20 undergraduates, 11 graduate students, and 6 postdocs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason R Rohr"
