 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to establish the inter-relationship between dielectric breakdown and electric-field induced deformation of elastomeric materials. Integral to the research objective will be quantifying the role of defects as well as electric-field induced mechanical localization produced by conducting fibers and electrode geometry. The approach will be largely experimental with direct measurements of the deformation fields produced by pre-straining and applied voltages for different fiber electrode arrangements and for a variety of device geometries. The observations will be compared with and complemented by modeling studies based on theories of nonlinear electro-mechanical coupling of deformable dielectrics. Together, these will be used to design and construct proof-of-concept electrically controlled devices capable of extreme strains.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include simplified designs for utilizing dielectric elastomers in engineering applications including energy harvesting devices, linear actuators and displays.  The project will also contribute to Harvard's existing outreach programs involving undergraduate research and local high-school outreach, other community outreach programs.",
