 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds support the acquisition of a new gas chromatograph to be used in paleoceanography and paleoclimate research at Brown University, specifically in the application of alkenone paleothermometry to understanding the ocean's role in climate change on timescales that range from tens to millions of years and from regional to global scales. Existing equipment in the laboratory has played a central role in high profile research and in training a large number of young scientists, but it has reached the end of its serviceable life and must be replaced. The more modern capabilities of the new instrument will also enable to laboratory to expand its toolbox to include a wider array of biomarker-based proxies for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include technical training for graduate and undergraduate students, both at Brown and from collaborating institutions, which further supports student research opportunities. The lead investigator also maintains an active outreach program for high school students and teachers each summer in which biomarker analysis is a major component. Results of biomarker research are also disseminated more generally through publications and an active speaking program to general audiences.",
