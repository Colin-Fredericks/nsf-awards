 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to build on the success of the first NSF CyberBridges Workshop to bring together the community of NSF OCI CAREER researchers. The 2013 NSF CyberBridges Workshop will provide attendees with opportunities to seek out new collaborations, strengthen existing collaborations, encourage networking, and to provide feedback to NSF from the OCI CAREER community on how to further build the community of cyberinfrastructure researchers. The workshop, provisionally titled ?Participant Support for the 2013 NSF CyberBridges Workshop: Developing the next generation of cyberinfrastructure faculty for computational- and data-enabled science and engineering?, will feature keynote speakers from five critical areas of cyberinfrastructure: Visualization, Grand Challenges and Interdisciplinary Research, Computational- and Data- Enabled Science and Engineering, Education, High Performance Computing.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure launched a new Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program to support investigators working on interdisciplinary research in cyberinfrastructure and the application of cyberinfrastructure for science and engineering research. Over the past three years, approximately 50 CAREER awards have been made to researchers.\r\n\r\nThe first workshop for Office of Cyberinfrastructure CAREER awardees was held June 25-26, 2012, in Arlington, Virginia. The attendees, who were funded by the NSF OCI, BIO, CISE, ENG, HER, and MPS directorates, were selected from 24 institutions. Five keynote presentations were given by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in fields relevant to the use and development of cyberinfrastructure in science and engineering research. Each keynote presentation was followed by a discussion session with workshop attendees.\r\n\r\nThe workshop provided a venue for CAREER awardees to interact and to develop new collaborations with leading researchers and other CAREER awardees. As a result of this workshop, 55 potential new collaborations were identified by attendees. The workshop provided many opportunities for discussions among attendees and speakers. We received many positive comments from the attendees.\r\n\r\nThe results of the first NSF CyberBridges Workshop are available on the NSF website at the URL http://nsf.gov/attachments/126052/public/ACCICAREERworkshoptalk.pdf. The website for the 2012 CyberBridges workshop is at the URL http://www.cse.psu.edu/conferences/cb2012/.\r\n",
