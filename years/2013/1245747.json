 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is critically important for engineering graduates to have the appropriate knowledge to respond to the nation's energy need.  This project will create interactive web based visualization materials and tools and will evaluate their effectiveness for enhancing student understanding of fuel cell theory and design. This will provide a greater number of engineering graduates who possess the required abilities. \r\n\r\nThe interactive nature of the web based materials will enable students to easily navigate the learning materials so they can investigate areas of interest to them. This will increase student interest, retention and amount of time spent learning. An interactive forum tool will also allow active learning to be implemented more easily in a classroom setting.  Active learning is a proven method for enhancing student learning.\r\n\r\nProducts from this project include interactive fuel cell learning materials that can be implemented nationally. Another product is an innovative material navigation system enabling students to easily identify materials that interest them. This navigation system will contribute to more time studying, and increase student retention. An interactive forum being developed will help instructors create active classrooms that will enhance student learning. The project also includes data driven assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of interactive visualization materials on student learning.",
