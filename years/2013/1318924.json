 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Claremont Colleges is awarded a planning grant to develop an integrated and collaborative research network focusing on the biomonitoring and conservation of Southern California ecosystems.  The centerpiece of this effort will be the Robert J. Bernard Field Station (BFS; http://bfs.claremont.edu/). The grant will support two workshops to bring together Southern California researchers and land managers to achieve the following goals: (1) develop a network of collaborators focusing on the ecology, biodiversity and conservation of Southern California ecosystems; (2) design a biological and climate monitoring program at BFS that provides a foundation for future research and educational activities; and (3) improve the ability to collect, access, archive and disseminate ecological and climatic data sets. A product of this effort will be a 10-year strategic plan that will outline the implementation of bio- and climate monitoring programs and a data management program at the BFS and describe how these programs can be incorporated into curricula at the Claremont Colleges and collaborating institutions. These planning efforts will have a regional research focus to provide diverse research opportunities for students at the Claremont Colleges and exploit the unique location of the Claremont Colleges to play a leadership role in regional ecology and biodiversity research.\r\n\r\nThis planning effort will facilitate communication among researchers interested in Southern California ecosystems and enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about the biota in Southern California and the environment that sustains it. The Claremont Colleges expect that collaboration among researchers and land managers will also result in the development of new regional multi-disciplinary projects. As such, this planning effort will indirectly enhance opportunities for underrepresented groups by encouraging the collaboration among regional colleges and universities, many of which are less than 100 miles from each other and have their own local field stations or preserves.",

Bernard Biological Field Station (BFS). Throughout the planning process, our focus was that both bio-monitoring and data management programs would be designed to enhance and expand existing multidisciplinary teaching and research at the BFS and provide a foundation for new collaboration with regional experts to better understand ecosystem function and protect biodiversity in Southern California. We have exceeded our expectations. Instead of developing a bio-monitoring program for just the BFS, a multi-institutional effort to monitor the sage scrub ecosystem, the endangered low elevation ecosystem type in southern California, was developed. The Partnership of Regional Institutions for Sage Scrub Monitoring (PRISSM) currently has three participating institutions (BFS, Claremont Colleges; Voorhis Ecological Reserve, Cal Poly Pomona; and North Etiwanda Preserve, San Bernardino County) and we anticipate that this process will develop as a long-term, dynamic and inclusive program, i.e., collaborations among contributors and the number of collaborators will increase in subsequent years. Currently, we have collected data on plant diversity and plant phenology annually at all three locations starting in 2015, and have monitored vertebrates, bird and butterfly diversity and phenology at the BFS over the same period. All information associated with the program can be found on our webpage (<a href=\"http://www.prissm.org\">www.prissm.org</a>). In addition, during this planning process, the BFS has also developed a data management policy/program in an effort, to collect, archive and disseminate all ecological/environmental datasets collected at the site. This is a critically important outcome of the planning process, because collecting, assembling, and archiving robust usable data sets is a key first step in addressing the many environmental challenges (e.g., climate change, habitat modification/degradation, nitrogen deposition, etc.) currently facing our field station/region/world. We expect that the BFS data management policy will lead to dynamic academic and research activities that can build and use foundational data to spur collaboration among students and faculty not only at the BFS, but also across the region. To facilitate participation, the BFS Director will hold two training sessions each year. Each fall semester (end of October), the BFS Director will host a workshop on creating an effective data management plan. Participants in this first workshop will also be introduced the concept of metadata, provided examples for review, and given a brief introduction into potential data repositories. The second workshop will be held in spring semester (late March) with a focus on training students and facilitating data upload form senior thesis projects. This second training session will be focused on using the program Morpho to create and upload files into the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity Network (KNB Network) the most appropriate repository for ecological/environmental data. Collaboration among researchers and land managers has already resulted in the development of new regional multi-disciplinary projects as the number of research collaborations between participating institutions have increased over the period of this planning process. As such, this planning effort has indirectly broadened opportunities for underrepresented groups. Collaborating campuses include a federally identified Minority-Serving Institution (e.g. California Polytechnic University, Pomona), and regional projects and those at field stations close to campuses (e.g., the BFS and the Voorhis Ecological Reserve) broaden participation of individuals from lower socio-economic status because they reduce or eliminate travel costs that can often limit both faculty and student involvement. In addition, incorporation of bio-monitoring and data management efforts into the science curriculum at multiple institutions provides relevant learning experiences. Students are active participants in our monitoring efforts and both students and faculty are being provided important training opportunities to improve their data management skills. Combined bio-monitoring and data management programs are enhancing research opportunities and infrastructure providing a foundation to make key research advances to preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the endangered sage scrub ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/17/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Wallace&nbsp;M&nbsp;Meyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
