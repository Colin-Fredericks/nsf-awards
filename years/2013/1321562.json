 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award aims to provide hands-on experience to scientists in communicating complex scientific concepts and the quality and accuracy of their research to a variety of audiences.  The investigators will achieve this aim through a series of interactive and problem-solving exercises in annual week-long workshops.  The workshops will use a detailed and complex science case study designed to simulate a real world scientific conflict involving competing scientific testimony. Participants will receive coaching and feedback on their performances thereby allowing them to experiment and practice with what works best in a given context. In addition, participants will discuss ethical issues concerning expert scientific communication.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts of the workshops are training scientists who are active in teaching, researching, writing, and publishing on how to improve their communication skills. Once participants complete the workshop, they will join other graduates of the workshop as \"Fellows\" and form a network of trained scientists who will educate other students and colleagues on the methods of effectively communicating scientific knowledge, research, and process in a variety of public forums.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientists play a special role in helping policy-makers and others understand important scientific information.  The challenge for many scientists is to communicate their science effectively in various forums, including in legal settings and legislative hearings.  When communicating science, scientists must be careful not to advocate for one position or the other but must be able to convey the meaning as well as the quality and accuracy of their work. \n\nIn response to the growing opportunity for scientists to inform public policy and educate decision makers in various legal forums, we developed a hands-on, interactive training program for scientists to learn how to effectively communicate their science.  From 2013-2014, William Mitchell the Expert Witness Training Academy (\"EWTA\") held 1-week training workshops each August at William Mitchell College of Law, an independent law school in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nThe Expert Witness Training Academy\n\nThe goal of the EWTA is to help scientists become better communicators and educators regardless of whether they ever become an expert witness. Each workshop included scientists as participants and a faculty of judges, attorneys, and scientific experts who train the scientists to communicate effectively in a variety of forums.  Participants in the workshops were selected across a breadth of professional experiences in the sciences.\n\nThe workshops trained scientists to become familiar with the legal processes relating to expert testimony.  The workshops provided a forum for scientists to learn how to communicate technical scientific data, interpret data, and extrapolate from data in court and other forums, without compromising the integrity of the research.\n\nForty-four scientists participated in the EWTA workshops 2013-2014.  The EWTA developed numerous supporting materials and online training resources that are available to part participants of the workshops.  (See, e.g., http://web.wmitchell.edu/expert-witness-training-academy/).\n\nThe EWTA workshops are grounded in extensive research and experience in educating adults to be clear and effective communicators.  Limited enrollment ensures that every participant receives one-on-one instruction and coaching.\n\nThe Workshop Design\n\nThe workshop methodology applies two core assumptions: 1) scientists learn best by doing rather than just listening and observing and 2) scientists more fully understand the role of expert witnesses by learning about and playing the role of lawyers.\n\nLearning by Doing--Role-Playing Expert Witnesses and Lawyers\n\nRather than using lectures and PowerPoint slides, participants in EWTA workshops actively participate with hands-on, interactive exercises.  Participants play various roles in an elaborate simulation, assuming the role of experts in various mock legal proceedings, including a legislative hearing, depositions, arbitration, and a full jury trial.  Along the way, participants receive feedback from the faculty and watch video of their individual performances.\n\nParticipants are coached extensively on how to communicate their science in these various arenas while learning the nuances of explaining scientific information to lay audiences.  During the week-long workshop, the EWTA enables participants to experiment and practice what works best for them.\n\nIn the EWTA workshops, participants not only practiced and played the role of expert witnesses but also performed the role of attorneys.  Through role-play and practice of fundamental lawyering skills, participants see the logic and perspective of the lawyers, judges, and jurors in various forums and develop a deeper understanding of effective communication.\n\nScientists may know about trials from television or personal experience, but they may not be aware of the complexity and breadth of the use of experts or the roles and purposes of other legal proceedings, including pretrial motions, arbitrations, negotiations, and congressional and public hearings.
