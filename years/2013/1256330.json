 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some groups of organisms, like beetles, contain incredible numbers of species, but most groups contain far fewer species. Likewise, some groups of animals and plants show dramatic variation in form and function, yet species in many other groups are so similar that only experts can tell them apart. This variation in diversity among groups is one of the most striking patterns in biology, yet its causes are still not understood. The proposed research will develop new mathematical, statistical, and computer-based tools to help scientists explain why biological diversity varies so dramatically among different kinds of organisms. The new methods will be applied to a number of animal groups, providing a high-resolution window into the historical processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe project will create statistical methods and computer software that will enable researchers to study complex processes that have occurred over millions of years using genetic data from living species. The methodological tools will be optimized for the analysis of massive datasets, thus complementing recent NSF initiatives to reconstruct and analyze the relationships between all living species. The project will establish an international collaborative network and will provide extensive training in computational and quantitative biology for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers through workshops and mentoring.",
