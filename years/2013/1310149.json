 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project explores the fundamental understanding of the structure and distortions of single-phase materials and finding new avenues to control their physical properties that may impact the advancement of multifunctional devices. The materials of interest are the magnetoelectric multiferroic rare-earth manganites in which ferroelectricity is induced when at some magnetic transition of the material. At the conclusion of this project, insights will be gained into the scientific parameters affecting the structural distortions, bond angles, magnetic, ferroelectric, and magnetoelectric properties. Furthermore, this understanding may be used in rational design of magnetoelectric multiferroics with enhanced polarization and critical temperatures. During the course of this project (i) diverse undergraduate and graduate students are being trained and mentored; (ii) results are being incorporated to refine physics and functional materials courses; and (ii) the results are being disseminated to a much broader audience through an energy club (working in cooperation with local libraries), hosting summer research opportunity for local high school teachers (at the University of Connecticut), and close interactions with students at Alabama A&M University. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The PI and her team are synthesizing single-phase pure and A/B-site doped orthorhobmically distorted perovskite rare-earth manganites that show magnetoelectric multiferroic properties.  Basic scientific research is focused on controlling the average ionic radius, ionic size mismatch, and magnetic properties of the doped ions at the A- and B-sites of the rare-earth manganites and on studying their effect on the structure, distortion, magnetic properties, ferroelectric transition, and magnetoelectric coupling. Various state-of-the-art characterization techniques and calculations at university and national laboratories are being utilized to train undergraduate and graduate students in order to investigate the comprehensive understanding of structure-distortion-property correlations in these material systems. The investigation anticipates the rational design of magnetoelectric multiferroics with enhanced electric polarization and/or critical temperatures, which potentially impacts the advancement of magnetoelectric based devices in consumer electronics, health care, and military systems.",
