  "por_txt_cntn": "\n(NOTE:  The period of this award was shortened from 4 years to 1 year with a 1-year extension.  It, therefore, covered the years 2013-2015.)\n\n \n\nThe International Union for Radio Science (URSI) is one of the international scientific unions related to the International Council for Science (ICSU).  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the member organization for the United States, and carries out its membership responsibilities in URSI through the U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI).   URSI is responsible for stimulating and coordinating, on an international basis, studies, research, applications, scientific exchange, and communication in the fields of radio science. \n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nBoth URSI and the USNC-URSI have ten Commissions that conduct most of the union or committee\u00c6s scientific work.  These are:\n\nCommission A - Electromagnetic Metrology\n\nCommission B &ndash; Fields and Waves\n\nCommission C &ndash; Radio Communication Systems and Signal Processing\n\nCommission D &ndash; Electronics and Photonics\n\nCommission E &ndash; Electromagnetic Environment and Interference\n\nCommission F &ndash; Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing\n\nCommission G &ndash; Ionospheric Radio and Propagation\n\nCommission H &ndash; Waves in Plasma\n\nCommission J &ndash; Radio Astronomy\n\nCommission K &ndash; Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine\n\nNot only does USNC-URSI organize an annual National Radio Science Meeting (NRSM) where research in each of these areas is presented and discussed, it also co-sponsors an annual summer meeting with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  In addition, it works closely with the Canadian National Committee in organizing the North American Radio Science (NARS) meeting that brings together radio scientists from the U.S. and Canada. \n\nThe committee also has a very active travel fellowship program supporting students and young scientists.  Several years ago, the USNC-URSI launched an annual Student Paper Competition at the NRSM, and that now has been implemented on an international level at the URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (GASS) as well. The USNC-URSI runs or is highly involved in both competitions and, using private funds, provides prizes for the winners.  These competitions allow younger scientists to share their research and results.\n\nIn collaboration with URSI, the committee also administers several international prizes in radio science.  These are the Booker Award, the Booker fellowship, the Dellinger Medal, and the recently-established Santimay Basu Prize.\n\n \n\nBROADER IMPACT\n\nResearch in radio science benefits society as a whole.   For example, electromagnetic interference is important for the performance of radio, TV, and navigation instruments.  Forest fires, crop yields, and soil moisture can be monitored by satellite instruments.  Space weather influences the ionosphere which, in turn, affects communication equipment and navigation.   Finally, electromagnetic fields and biological systems can interact in both harmful and beneficial ways.  Radio science is studying these causes and effects.  Ideas shared at scientific conferences at meetings like the NRSM, the URSI GASS, and the NARS meeting can lead to exchanges and collaborations from which further discoveries can be made.\n\nUSNC-URSI is one of the most active national committees within URSI.  The committee has developed a very successful pipeline that (1) exposes graduate students to the USNC-URSI and the international union, and encourages their participation in special student programs; (2) promotes the participation and leadership of U.S. radio scientists in U.S.-based Commissions; (3) encourages U.S. Commission members to participate in URSI's parallel international commissions; (4) promotes leadership opportunities for U.S. radio scientists on the URSI commissions and the URSI Executive Council.  The number of U.S. radio scientists active in each of these areas demonstrates the success the committ..."
