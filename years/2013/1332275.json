 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an urgent need for portable, rapid, sensitive and specific influenza surveillance systems worldwide. The PI proposes to fundamentally improve the diagnostic landscape of influenza within a flexible, cost-effective, and field portable telemedicine platform. They will develop a digital immunoassay system that makes use of novel electro-adaptive and programmable microfluidics technologies as well as cellphone based multispectral fluorescent cytometry and computational microscopy tools. The proposed system will create arrays of hundreds of thousands of encoded particles containing fluid droplets. These particles will be first segmented equally using inertial-microfluidic sorting so that there is a single particle per drop, where the presence of influenza subtype antigens and the associated enzyme-linked antibody sandwich will lead to an ?on or off? fluorescence signal in each drop. The number of drops lighting up (corresponding to specific color- and shape-coded particles with different subtype-specific antibodies) will then be imaged all in parallel using a cellphone-based multispectral imaging cytometry system. Through a custom-developed smart application running on the same cellphone, these immunoassay images will immediately be analyzed for sensitive and rapid detection of various influenza subtypes, where the test results will also be transmitted wirelessly to secure servers, enabling real-time spatio-temporal mapping and analysis of the disease.",

Current detection approaches with high sensitivity require a clinical laboratory setting and 1-2 days turnaround which can limit potential public health actions in the lead up to a pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need for portable, rapid, sensitive and specific influenza surveillance systems worldwide.</p>\n<p>To fundamentally improve the diagnostic landscape of influenza within a flexible, cost-effective, and field-portable telemedicine platform, in this grant period we worked on the development of a digital immunoassay system that makes use of novel sample preparation technologies as well as cellphone based imaging and computational microscopy tools. Funded by NSF, we created a homogenous, enzyme-free amplification strategy that identifies the presence of proteins within 10 minutes at room temperature without any wash or sample preparation steps. Our homogenous entropy-driven biomolecular assay (HEBA) utilizes hybridization/displacement of oligonucleotides upon the analyte-dependent formation of a catalytic immune-complex. HEBA yields its signal in various biofluids (e.g. blood and plasma) and detects influenza A nucleoprotein down to fM levels in a batch reaction, outperforming a commercial rapid flu test detecting flu antigen in a study performed with unprocessed patient samples. When adapted to a microfluidic digital assay format, HEBA achieves detection of tens of molecules. &nbsp;Furthermore, we also developed new assays suitable for a microscale homogenous digital ELISA format and also a digital nucleic acid format with over 20-fold increased signal to noise. Our digital ELISA format based on HEBA was demonstrated to sense influenza nucleoprotein in buffer down to 4 aM levels. We have also explored two separate methods to compartmentalize volumes in microfluidics that are suitable for a point-of-care assay. One is based on dead-end filling of a flexible well array and the other makes use of magnetic fluids (ferrofluids) to generate droplets without any pumps. We expect future uses of this assay in various applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and drug screening. In addition to these, we have also made some significant progress on mobile phone based sensing and diagnostics instrumentation to provide a cost-effective, light-weight and sensitive read-out platform for these developed assays.</p>\n<p>The systems developed in this NSF funded project include transformative innovations designed to achieve a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic platform to multiple flu subtypes that robustly can handle internal defects with a flexible architecture, and is insensitive to environmental conditions due to a digital ELISA readout mechanism. This approach can satisfy an urgent need for rapid, robust, sensitive and specific influenza surveillance systems that is also recognized by the WHO. Direct integration of this platform with the cellphone communication networks will ensure that diagnostic results are accurately and rapidly reported and recorded. Similarly, sensitive, specific and environmentally robust tests that can be performed at the point-of-care, providing larger spatio-temporal data sets of accurate information are urgently required for statistically sound epidemiological models. These models can directly aid in prediction, management and analysis of emerging epidemics as well as public health decisions and interventions to reduce spread of disease, which can be implemented through targeted vaccinations, or suggested social interventions to change behavior responsible for the spread. Furthermore, these large and accurate datasets can also aid in historical monitoring of disease spread and correlations with environmental and social factors ? advancing research in epidemiology itself.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the impact of our technology spans molecular assays, diagnostics, and distributed health. Assays and handheld low-cost diagnostic instruments developed are general and could apply to any immune-sensing application, aptamer-based sensing, and nucleic acid based-sensing modalities, achieving a one-pot amplified reaction. Such an approach should have a wide-reaching impact on how we chronicle and make decisions concerning our collective health, with distributed and point-of-care measures of a myriad of disease states at low cost. The new methods to greatly enhance the signal to noise for nucleic acid amplification tests that we discovered should have a huge impact on a wide-range of diagnostic tests (i.e. PCR-based tests)
