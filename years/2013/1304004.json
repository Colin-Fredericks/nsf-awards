More specialists are needed to prevent and investigate threats to the national cyber infrastructure such as theft of data, disabling of networks, and communications disruptions. The project objectives are: to develop a model on ground and online curriculum; to implement a replicable strategy to create awareness of cybersecurity careers among elementary and secondary school teachers, guidance counselors, students, and parents; to shape articulation agreements and other transfer models with universities (especially CAE/IAE institutions); and to create a learning model that helps military veterans earn AAS degrees in DF/IA and advance into technician-level careers and/or further education at universities.",
