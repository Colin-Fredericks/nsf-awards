Participation in NSDI and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience and will provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the &#64257;eld, and exposes students to leading edge work in the &#64257;eld. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks\r\nand distributed systems.",
