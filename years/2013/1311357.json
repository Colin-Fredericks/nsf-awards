 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important advantages complex organisms possess is the ability to change their physiology in response to the environment.  The regulation and expression of genes through epigenetic mechanisms is integral to this adaptive physiology.  Epigenetic modifications, such as the methylation of DNA, represent fundamentally important ways in which organisms regulate gene expression without associated changes to the genome.  This research program focuses on understanding the function of DNA methylation through the study of social insects.  Social insects display some of the most striking forms of adaptive physiology, wherein multiple morphological forms (castes) display division of labor.  The research team will study the prevalence, variation, and importance of DNA methylation to the regulation of gene expression by exploring DNA methylation throughout the genome of different castes of the termite Zootermopsis nevadensis.  The relationship between DNA methylation and gene function will be explored through the examination of termite gene expression patterns, and their relationship to observed levels of DNA methylation among different castes.  The research will also lead to a greater understanding of how DNA methylation affects gene splicing.  \r\n\r\nThe research will advance our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms, which play important roles in development and disease in many organisms.  The proposed studies will also shed light on the basic biology of termites, which represent agricultural and commercial pests.  Finally, the research program will be integrated into a novel on-campus, undergraduate education plan involving the keeping and studying of honey bees in an urban environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost organisms are capable of developing different forms in response to distinct environmental conditions.  This developmental plasticity is thought to be a critical process affecting the success of many species.  This research program studied the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity.  The research team focused on understanding the chemical marks on DNA that led to changes in gene function that could ultimately lead to changes in development.  The research program specifically studied the process of development plasticity in a termite.  Termites are social insects and live in highly social groups.  Almost all social insects display extreme examples of developmental plasticity.  For example, termites can develop into different castes, such as workers, soldiers, kings, or queens, which show great variation in form and function.  The research team studied the specific chemical mark of DNA methylation, which is associated with developmental plasticity, in multiple termite castes.  The results suggest that patterns of DNA methylation are associated with differences between termite castes.  DNA methylation is also correlated with gene function, in that genes with high levels of DNA methylation are turned on at relatively high levels and tend to show distinct splicing patterns.  Furthermore, patterns of DNA methylation across termite genes contrast with patterns seen in other insects.  Overall, this research provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms that cause differences in development.  This study also sheds light on the factors that allow highly social species, such as social insects, to function successfully in the environment. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Goodisman"
