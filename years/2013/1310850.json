 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the process by which new species evolve (speciation) is a fundamental question in biological sciences.  A popular, but largely untested idea is that the formation of one species can catalyze the formation of other species within a community of interacting organisms (sequential speciation). Previous work has shown that a shift of the apple maggot fly from its native hawthorn host plant to the introduced domesticated apple about 150 years ago in the eastern US has induced a sequential host shift in the insect parasite community that attacks the flies. Specifically, as the fly shifts to attacking the fruits of a new host plant, the insect parasites that attack that fly shift in kind. What remains unknown is how general and rapid sequential speciation events are in nature. A powerful approach is to test the sequential speciation hypothesis in a more proximate case in the western US where the fly was recently introduced just 50 years ago. The proposed research will examine changes in the flies and their parasites in this new habitat to better evaluate the rate of speciation. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the origins of biodiversity is one of the central issues in biological sciences. In this regard, sequential speciation may be particular relevant for understanding biodiversity in general and in particular the astonishing levels of insect biodiversity (estimated 10-30 million species worldwide, the most diverse group of animals on the planet). Additionally, the apple maggot fly and several closely related species are major economic pests of several agricultural crops. Characterization of the origins of the parasitoid community can inform bio-control schemes to help farmers control the fly before it becomes a serious pest in the western United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report\n\n \n\nDescription\n\nA central concept in evolutionary ecology is that \u00e6biodiversity begets more biodiversity\u00c6. As new species form they create new opportunities for others to exploit, potentially catalyzing a chain reaction of speciation events for whole communities of organisms. Such \u00e6sequential divergence\u00c6 may be particularly important for understanding the great diversity of plant-eating insects and their parasites. When plant-eating insects diversify by shifting to attack new plants, new opportunities become available for their parasitoids to follow suit and diversify, as well. Previous work has demonstrated genetic, behavioral, and diapause differences among the parasitoid wasps attacking Rhagoletis fruit flies in the eastern United States, including the hawthorn and recently formed apple-infesting host races of R. pomonella, consistent with the sequential hypothesis. Establishing the generality of sequential divergence for an even more recent example of host shifting involving R. pomonella flies and their parasitoids in the western U.S was the goal of the project.   \n\nFifty years ago, R. pomonella was introduced into the Pacific Northwest via larval-infested apples. Here, the fly has formed two new races by shifting from apple to attack black hawthorn and introduced ornamental hawthorn. Black and ornamental hawthorn flies in the Pacific Northwest are attacked by three wasps. However, apple flies are not, implying that the wasps were not introduced along with apple flies but instead originated via shifts from the native snowberry fly, R. zephyria, a sibling species that co-occurs with R. pomonella in the Pacific Northwest. \n\nThe goal of the project was to determine whether snowberry-fly attacking wasps have sequentially radiated by shifting to attack black and ornamental hawthorn flies. To accomplish this, the DNA of wasps was sequenced to test for evidence of genetic differences. In addition, eclosion times of wasps (when they come out of the ground after they overwinter) was measured to test whether they have evolved differences in this trait allowing them to track the eclosion times of their respective fly hosts. Finally, behavioral be assays were performed to test if the parasitoids prefer the odors emitted from the fruits of their host flies and avoid non-natal fruit odors. \n\nScientific Outcomes\n\n1.) We sequenced DNA to look for genetic differences between the three wasps attacking ornamental hawthorn, black hawthorn, and snowberry flies in Washington and Oregon. All the DNA sequencing is completed and the results are currently being analyzed. Preliminary evidence from mitochondrial DNA and morphological analysis suggests that two species in the Pacific Northwest (Diachasma mellea and Utetes lectoides) are similar to species found in the eastern U.S. (D. mellea and U. canaliculatus). These findings are consistent with flies and wasps in the western US being similar to those in the eastern US, not unexpected given their recent introduction. The key will be to determine how different the DNA sequences are for genes from the nuclear DNA of wasps, which proved to be different among eastern wasps.  \n\n \n\n2.) Parasitoids were collected in the field and rearing studies performed to test for eclosion time differences between wasps attacking different fly hosts. This is important because the plants that flies attack fruit at different times during the season and the flies eclose at different times to coincide with the different fruiting times of their host plants. Because the flies only live for a month, this makes them temporally isolated from each other, Data for all three species of wasps attacking ornamental and black hawthorn, and snowberry at four sites where the plants co-occur in the Pacific Northwest have been collected. The results indicate that wasps attacking different flies differ in their eclosion times, a pattern consistent with the sequential hypothesis. \n\n \n\n3.) Behavioral assays were cond..."
