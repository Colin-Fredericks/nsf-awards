 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines novel services built on top of public cloud\r\ninfrastructure to enable cost-effective high-performance computing.\r\nThe PIs will explore the on-demand, elastic, and configurable features of\r\ncloud computing to complement the traditional supercomputer/cluster\r\nplatforms. More specifically, this research aims to assess the efficacy\r\nof building dynamic cloud-based clusters leveraging the configurability\r\nand tiered pricing model of cloud instances. The scientific value of this\r\nproposal lies in the novel use of untapped features of cloud computing\r\nfor HPC and the strategic adoption of small, cloud-based clusters for\r\nthe purpose of developing/tuning applications for large supercomputers.\r\n\r\nThrough this research, the PIs expect to answer key research questions\r\nregarding: (1) automatic workload-specific cloud cluster configuration,\r\n(2) cost-aware and contention-aware data and task co-scheduling,\r\nand (3) adaptive, integrated cloud instance provisioning and job\r\nscheduling, plus workload aggregation for cloud instance rental cost\r\nreduction. If successful, this research will result in tools that\r\nadaptively aggregate, configure, and re-configure cloud resources for\r\ndifferent HPC needs, with the purpose of offering low-cost R&D\r\nenvironments for scalable parallel applications.",
