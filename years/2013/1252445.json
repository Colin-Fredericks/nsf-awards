In addition, it is developing and empirically validating a methodological framework for enhancing early numerical development. Building on work previously conducted with NSF support, the investigator is conducting a full-scale, randomized, experimental training study of the effectiveness of five different PC-based, in-home training interventions on numeracy in pre-school children. The study has a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal research design that will yield both correlational and causal (quasi-experimental, experimental) evidence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this empirical project was to identify the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which early numerical learning occurs and to use this knowledge to improve numerical skills in children before entering school.  To this end, we conducted short-term, intensive PC-based numerical training with over 200 preschool-aged children (3-5 years), collecting pre- and post-training data on numerical, linguistic, executive, and other general cognitive abilities using both brain (event-related potentials) and behavioral measures, as well as daily performance during the 2 weeks of training itself.  From the pre-test data alone we have gleaned a number of important insights regarding the mechanisms of preschool numeracy. \n\nUsing pre-test data from the first 100 children in our study, we have found that individual differences spontaneous neural sensitivity to numerosity (or the number of objects in a set) correlates with individual differences in counting proficiency.  More specifically, we have demonstrated that individual differences in early attentional processing of objects relates to conceptual development in counting.  Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative differences in the neural response to number suggest differences in how attention is distributed to objects before and after children learn to count (Hyde, Simon, Berteletti, &amp; Mou, 2017). \n\nApplying a novel analytic approach to pre-test data, we have also developed a comprehensive theoretical model of the relative contributions of various cognitive and linguistic components thought to be important in explaining individual differences in counting development in preschool children.  Our analyses revealed that individual differences in knowledge of the numeral list, non-verbal approximate numerical ability, working memory, pre-reading knowledge, and executive conflict processing all make unique and important contributions to explaining conceptual understanding of counting in preschoolers (Mou, Berteletti, &amp; Hyde, 2018).  This work also revealed that knowledge of the number list, a likely proxy for experience with number words, explains much more variance in individual differences than any of the other factors considered.   This should be of interest of those in any field including education, psychology, and tech development (e.g., educational software), where improving early numeracy is of interest.  Furthermore, this finding may have implications for early numeracy curriculum development in the future. \n\nThis grant has also supported the analysis and publication of a previously acquired dataset showing that brief approximate numerical training leads to immediate gains in symbolic arithmetic in 1st grade children.  This result replicates and extends a recent U.S.-based lab study to a school-based setting in Pakistan (Khanum, Hanif, Berteletti, Spelke, &amp; Hyde, 2016). This work contributes to the major goals of the project by identifying a potential mechanism driving early numeracy, non-verbal approximate numerical abilities, and suggests a way in which it might be harnessed for intervention.\n\nMore broadly, existing work and theories seem to focus on the contribution of particular mechanisms to early numeracy (e.g., non-verbal number, language, executive function, experience) and largely fail to provide an integrative account of the relative contributions and combinations of factors that actually give rise in to numeracy.  This grant also supported the development of several reviews and commentaries (Hyde &amp; Mou, 2015; Hyde, Berteletti, &amp; Mou, 2016), which, combined with the empirical work above, build support for the view that early numeracy draws on the combination of precursor non-verbal numerical abilities, cultural experience with numbers, and general executive abilities that allow innovation in conceptual thinking.  Findings from this project also suggest that the role of non-verbal, or core numerical mechanisms in individual differences, while uniquely important to the development of numeracy, may best be understood in the broader context of experience and general capacities for learning.  Our work has started to delineate the particular contributions of each of these mechanisms and promises to continue to do so in the future with more analyses.\n\nWhile the work cited above fulfills some of the major objects of the project by providing new evidence for and theorizing about the potential mechanisms and combinations of mechanisms that drive early numeracy, a major objective of the grant that was not realized was to analyze the training effects on post-test data.  This was due to initial delays, a broadening of the scope of the project, and unanticipated complexities in the pre-test data.
