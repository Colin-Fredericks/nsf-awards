Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2013 program will feature two principle speakers (Mihalis Dafermos and Assaf Naor), each of whom will give a two-hour lectures, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by four mathematicians, including two females (Marianna Csornyei, Andrea R. Nahmod, Fedor Nazarov, Peter Topalov). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.",
