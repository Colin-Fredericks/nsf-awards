 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is to utilize a suite of instruments, including\r\nan airglow imager, to investigate short-period\r\ngravity waves in the Arctic atmosphere over Alaska. Short-period\r\ngravity waves are an important component of the larger atmospheric\r\ncirculation as these waves are believed to transport a large amount of\r\nvertical moment flux into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)\r\nregion. While the propagation nature  and sources of these waves have\r\nbeen studied extensively at low- and mid-latitudes, little is known about their behavior at high latitudes. Recent efforts have\r\nbegun to characterize the waves over the Antarctic continent, while\r\nthe project proposed here will focus on the Arctic. Specifically, the\r\nproposed research will establish a long-term winter time series of\r\nshort-period gravity waves in the Arctic, including their dominant\r\nsource regions, and influences of large-scale tidal and planetary wave\r\nmotion. The co-located Rayleigh lidar will provide essential high\r\nvertical resolution temperature measurements to help elucidate the\r\nvertical wave propagation, individual wave contribution to the\r\nEliassen-Palm (EP) flux, and coupling between the lower and upper\r\natmosphere during stratospheric warming events.",
