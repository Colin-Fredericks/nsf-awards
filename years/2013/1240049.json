 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses affect all forms of cellular life; however, it is extremely difficult to trace their evolutionary history. This project will reconstruct the phylogeny of an understudied branch of the viral tree of life:  that of circular eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (CESS) viruses.  CESS viruses are the smallest known viruses, yet they include pathogens with devastating impacts on agriculture worldwide. Recently, general environmental sampling has uncovered a diversity of CESS viruses that are only distantly related to these pathogens and has shown that they infect a wider range of hosts than previously thought, including insects and fungi. This project systematically tests previously unexplored hosts to discover, sequence, and classify their CESS viruses. Phylogenetic analyses will then determine how all CESS viruses are related to one another, providing a framework for classifying the CESS viral tree of life.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this research include training of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdocs, as well as K-12 outreach and creation of web-based resources for the scientific and general public. Middle school students will be involved in collecting invertebrate samples, which will be processed during a virology training workshop for graduate students and postdocs on CESS virus genomics. Project results will be displayed on a website to increase public knowledge about CESS viruses, and bioinformatics tools will be shared freely with the scientific community.",

Using the only protein shared by all of these viruses (Rep) we built a family tree with over 900 species of CRESS DNA viruses. We determined that the evolution of Rep proteins in these viruses was not described very well by the standard tools that evolutionary biologists use to describe protein evolution in bacteria and eukaryotes. This motivated us to create a new model for Rep protein evolution. This bespoke model improved our ability to see deep relationships among families of CRESS DNA viruses compared to standard models. The most exciting conclusion from our tree (image 1) is that the Reps of families <em>Geminiviridae</em> (green) and <em>Genomoviridae</em> (pink) are not separate groups, but it is instead clear that genomovirus Rep evolved from a geminivirus Rep, specifically a Rep that has to be made in multiple parts and spliced together to function. This splice-form Rep appears to have evolved only one among these families, and is used by four genera of geminiviruses, almost all genomoviruses, and by the black unclassified Rep sequences that were in the same group on the tree. It is logical that the more complex splice-form Rep would have evolved once instead of multiple times in a similar way, but our study was the first time this mixed relationship among geminivirus and genomovirus Reps has been observed. The high confidence we have in the relationship is due to strong statistical support from analyses using our bespoke model for CRESS DNA virus evolution. We have made our model freely available and incorporated it into a common tool to determine which evolutionary model to use (ProtTest, screenshot in image 2) and this, and much more information about CRESS DNA viruses is available at <a title=\"cressdna.org\" href=\"We determined how a large and diverse group of viruses ? those with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that encode a particular ?Rep? protein to help replicate their genomes (CRESS DNA viruses) ? are related to each other.
