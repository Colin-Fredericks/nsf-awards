 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative, exploratory, learning strand project focuses on improving reflective decision-making among elementary school students during the planning and re-design activities of the engineering design process.  Five teacher researchers in three elementary schools provide the classroom laboratories for the study.  Specified units from Engineering is Elementary, a well-studied curriculum, provide the engineering content.  In year one, the qualitative research observes student discourse as students develop designs.  Based on the results, a paper engineering note book with prompts is designed for use in year two while a digital notebook is developed.  In year three, the students use the digital notebook to develop their designs and redesigns.  \r\n\r\nThe research identifies patterns of language that contribute to the reflective discourse and determines how the paper and electronic versions of the notebook improve the discourse.  An advisory committee provides advice and evaluation.  The notebooks are described in conference proceedings and made available online. \r\n\r\nThis work synthesizes what is known about the use of the notebooks in science and engineering education at the elementary school and investigates how to improve their use through digital media.",
