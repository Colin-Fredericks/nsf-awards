 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program in the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Josef Michl of the University of Colorado at Boulder for investigation of previously unknown relaxed geometrical structures of peralkylated oligosilanes in their lowest singlet excited state, which are responsible for observed blue and green emissions in such compounds. These structures contain one silicon atom in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry or two silicon atoms at geometries half-way between tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal, and their silicon atoms carry five instead of the usual four \"valence\" orbitals. The calculated structures have implications for electronic excitation and electron conduction in silicon nanoparticles and all saturated molecules, but this requires experimental verification. A second independent project deals with the chemistry of the icosahedral carborane cage CB11. It is proposed to prepare new reversible anion/radical couples of potential interest as components of new hole conductors, and to examine the reactivity of such cages when they contain a naked boron vertex. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is especially relevant for solar energy conversion in solar cells and for photonics (for example, understanding light emission in silicon nanoparticles that may be used in television and computer displays). To date, several theoretical predications have yet to be tested, and the work in this award will provide much-needed experimental verification. The work will provide graduate students and postdoctoral research associates with excellent training in both synthetic organic and experimental physical chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Localization and delocalization of electrons in molecules and materials in their ground and electronically excited or ionized states is one of their most important characteristics and to a large degree determines their utility.  While it is fairly well understood and predictable in molecules containing &pi; electrons in conjugated bonds and aromatic rings, it is poorly understood in saturated molecules, which contain only single bonds.  The objective of our 2.5-year grant was to help remedy this situation.  We have made considerable progress, both in theoretical understanding and predictions (we now understand the striking difference between the properties of loose and tight helices of oligosilanes) and in an effort to provide experimental support for a very unusual prediction of the presence of a trigonal bipyramidal Si atom with an expanded valence shell in the excited and anionic states of a short oligosilane by time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy.  Half a century ago, expansion of the valence shell in atoms of main group elements beyond an octet was taken for granted, but modern methods of quantum chemistry showed that in ordinary situations it does not take place.  Our computational discovery suggested situations in which it does take place and will belong into textbooks if we confirm the result experimentally. \n\nA second major accomplishment was the successful verification of the hypothesis that in toluene/LiCB11Me12 and a sufficiently basic buffer as an electrolyte, the redox potential of Li+/Li would be close enough to that of H2/H+ for H2 to be able to act as a surrogate for Li.  This opens the door to the possibility of performing electrochemical fixation of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions with a minimal expenditure of energy.  If this turns out to be practical, it will have a tremendous practical impact, since the currently used high-pressure high-temperature Haber-Bosch process, which produces enough fertilizer to keep half of mankind from starvation, also consumes several per cent of the total energy used by mankind.  \n\nIn addition, we have completed several earlier NSF projects, including a study of self-assembled metallacages in solution.  In contrast to an earlier suspicion, we obtained direct evidence that they do not contain solvent vapor bubbles.  This is important for the anticipated future use of such cages for catalysis.  We have continued our work on arrays of dipolar molecular rotors in collaborations with Prof. Rogers in the Physics department in Boulder, who has an NSF grant on the subject, and Prof. Batail in Angers, France.  Both groups depend on us to furnish specifically designed compounds. \n\nOur activities in the field of carboranes were recognized by the Boron in the Americas Award in 2014, and those in photophysics/photochemistry by the Hammond Award in 2015.For 31 years, until the end of 2014, I was the editor of Chemical Reviews, the highest impact factor journal in chemistry.
