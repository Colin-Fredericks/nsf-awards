The project will convene a series of meetings that will: 1) establish standards for capturing and storing click-stream data from learning games and other sources; 2) define analytic methods for organizing and querying data to facilitate a variety of analytic processes; and 3) defining a set of APIs that will guide developers to build games that can contribute data to a national database.  The project is a partnership of researchers from academia, private non-profit research institutions and for-profit entities",
