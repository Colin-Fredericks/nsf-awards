 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2010, the observatory at Summit, Greenland, in the center of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), was expanded to include a comprehensive suite of cloud-atmosphere observing instruments including microwave and infrared spectrometers, cloud radar, depolarization lidar, ceilometer, precipitation sensor, sodar, and a twice-daily radiosonde program. This observing effort was termed ICECAPS (Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit).  A continuation of this project is proposed here, with moderate enhancements to include atmospheric aerosol observations. Measurements from this expanded instrument suite will be used to derive critical baseline atmospheric data products including:\r\n* Atmospheric State - tropospheric temperature, moisture, and wind profiles\r\n* Aerosols - concentration of total particles and cloud condensation nuclei\r\n* Cloud Macrophysics - occurrence, vertical boundaries, temperature\r\n* Cloud Microphysics - phase, water content, and characteristic particle size\r\n* Precipitation - type and rate\r\nTogether these products, when combined with similar ongoing measurements at Summit, can be used to study processes that impact the surface energy budget and precipitation at the site, as well as addressing questions related to atmospheric stability, cloud phase composition, the persistence of stratiform clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions. It is further anticipated that these observations will continue to be used by a broad cross-section of the scientific community to promote understanding of GIS and Arctic climate, validate satellite observations, and evaluate model simulations.  Graduate students play significant roles in most aspects of this project, gaining valuable experience with polar field work, operating instruments, and processing data. In addition, this research team has developed a unique education and outreach plan to work with students from local schools using simple, proxy instrumentation to help develop their understanding of atmospheric principles and observations, and to enhance the scientific curriculum in their schools via a wide range of outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project analyzed the unique cloud and atmospheric observations being collected at Summit Station by the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS).  We addressed three general themes under this project: (1) characterizing cloud and ice precipitation properties using the unique microwave radiometer observations at Summit, (2) the investigation of the impacts of long-lived mixed-phase clouds, and (3) the physical characteristics of tropopause polar vortices.  During this project, we\n\ndeveloped an improved absorption model for deriving the amount of cloud liquid from satellite observations, with very large improvements when the temperature of the liquid cloud droplets is below freezing (i.e., is supercooled); \ndiscovered that there are two general categories of ice precipitation, and analyzed the atmospheric conditions for each; \ninvestigated single-layer clouds that contain both ice and liquid simultaneously to understand what atmospheric processes maintain these clouds; and\nprovided the first observational study of tropopause polar vortices, which are mesoscale arctic phenomena that can greatly influence weather at midlatitudes.\n\n\n \n\nOur research has potential to influence weather and climate forecasts outside of the Arctic.  Supercooled liquid water exists in clouds around the entire globe, and a recent study by an outside group using our new absorption model inside a global weather prediction model has shown improved representation of these clouds in the southern hemisphere storm tracks.  Additionally, a better understanding of how tropopause polar vortices strengthen and decay will improve their representation in weather forecast models, and as these vortices can influence mid-latitude weather when they get caught into the jet stream, should led to improved longer-range weather forecasts.\n\n \n\nAnother major achievement for this project was the development of four new early career scientists, each of who received (will receive) a Master?s of Science degree from the University of Oklahoma analyzing ICECAPS data and model output over Greenland.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David D Turner"
