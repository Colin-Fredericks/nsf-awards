 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the travel of fifty (50) undergraduate and graduate students from the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering, and related sciences at selected Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (Minority Serving Institutions including Hispanic Serving Institutions (MSI) and Tribal Colleges) to attend and participate in technical symposia at the 40th NOBCChE Annual Technology Conference in Indianapolis, IN from October 1-4, 2013. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research to a forum composed of industry, government, and academic peers. Students will have the opportunity to meet colleagues from other HBCU, MSI, and majority institutions to develop research collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry or chemical engineering disciplines. Students will be exposed to new ideas and innovations in an atmosphere with role models who were trained in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These new ideas and innovations are critical to the development of the next generation of products and technologies. The outcome of this activity is that students will be encouraged to pursue graduate degrees and post-doctoral positions in chemistry, chemical engineering, and related fields of study, thus increasing the pipeline for the development of ideas and innovations from students who in their careers may choose employment opportunities as scientists and engineers in either the government, academic or the industry sectors.",
