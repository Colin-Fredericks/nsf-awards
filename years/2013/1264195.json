 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first goal of this research is to assess and attribute the response of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream to anthropogenic forcing in comprehensive climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The Principal Investigator (PI) suggests a simple method to partition the impact of ozone and greenhouse gas induced changes on the jet stream will be sugg. It will allow to better quantify uncertainty in climate projections, separating differences in the thermal response to greenhouse gases and ozone from differences in the sensitivity of the jet stream to changes in atmospheric temperature. Analysis of CMIP5 models to previous generation climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Chemistry Climate Model Validation Activity 2 (CCMVal2) will be undertaken to assess the impact of model improvements on climate projection.\r\n\r\nThe second goal of this research is to understand the mechanism(s) causing changes in the jet stream, using a series of controlled experiments with an idealized general circulation model. Preliminary analysis of CMIP3 and CCMVal2 models suggests that the jet is sensitive to the temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, so that the response is similar when the tropics are warmed or the high latitudes are cooled. This hints at a common mechanism behind greenhouse gas and ozone induced changes. In addition, stratospheric ozone induced changes have a strong seasonal footprint. The PI will explore interactions between the background seasonal cycle in the stratosphere and troposphere with a seasonally localized ozone-like forcing. Observed trends in the midlatitude circulation of the atmosphere are stronger in the Southern Hemisphere summer than in other seasons (or in the Northern Hemisphere), due to the combined effect of greenhouse gases and ozone. This has had significant impacts on precipitation throughout the Southern Hemisphere, even the tropics. Thus this project will increase our understanding of how changes in model configuration, e.g. representation of the stratosphere, impact a model's response. \r\n\r\nThis research will involve a graduate student and postdoctoral scientist, providing opportunity for their development as a research scientists.",

In the midlatitudes (roughly 30 to 60 degrees latitude), the circulation is dominated by the so-called jet streams, strong currents that blow from west to east in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Slight shifts in these currents can make the difference between mild winter and freezing temperatures, or between drought and flood on the local level.\n\nPerhaps less intuitively, the atmospheric circulation may also play a critical role in sea level rise.

Emissions of the latter were halted as a result of the Montreal Protocol, but continue to impact the climate.   We focused on the Southern Hemisphere, as this hemispheric has been more greatly impacted by ozone loss (the Antarctic Ozone Hole), but also because circulation changes here are relevant to future sea level changes.\n\nA key finding of our research is that ozone loss over Antartica has been the primary driver of the observed poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream.  The slow recovery of the ozone hole over the remainder of this century will help minimize future changes, but could be overwhelmed by greenhouse gas emissions if we choose to follow a high carbon future.  If we choose to aggressively curb future greenhouse gas emissions, however, we have a good chance of limiting any further changes to the position of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream -- and so help reduce the potential impact of global warming on Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nOn a more technical level, our research sought to understand and narrow the uncertainty in future projections of climate change.

The Volcanic Model Intercomparison Project is part of a world wide assessment of climate models, and will help us improve and understand their response to volcanic eruptions.  As the response of the circulation to volcanic eruptions can be observed, this is a golden opportunity to test our models.  Models that get the right response to natural variability are more likely to make better predictions of the circulation response to human induced forcings.\n\nA final important result of this grant was the training and mentoring of two graduate students and a postdoctoral research scientist.  They were given the opportunity conduct cutting edge research, and to learn how we can use high perfomance computing to advance our understanding of the climate system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edwin P Gerber"
