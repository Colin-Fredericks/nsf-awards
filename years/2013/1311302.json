 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change, and excess nitrogen in coastal waterways can cause a decline in water quality. A newly discovered microbial process could reduce the amount of methane reaching the atmosphere and nitrogen reaching waterways.  This microbial process converts methane into the less potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and toxic nitrite into unreactive nitrogen gas.  However, it is not known if this microbial process occurs in nature.  This study will investigate whether this process occurs in nature, and if so at what rate, in agricultural groundwater on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  This study will provide information on the rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification in agricultural systems, which tend to have high nitrogen levels.  Unlike all previous work on this process that has occurred only in the laboratory, this project will investigate this microbial process using experiments conducted in the field. \r\n\r\nIf this microbial process is better understood, it could potentially be used as a remediation tool to reduce the leaching of nitrogen into surrounding waters and methane emissions.  Results from this study will be shared with local farmers and stakeholders in an effort to implement best management practices that would stimulate this new microbial process to reduce nitrogen and methane losses from farm fields.  Scientific training of graduate and undergraduate students will be supported by this project through providing experience with biogeochemical methods and instrumentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMethane and nitrogen are naturally occurring compounds that are infrequently linked together in the environment.  Methane is a strong greenhouse gas that is considered an atmospheric pollutant and a contributor to climate change.  Nitrogen compounds dissolve readily in water and are water pollutants, especially in estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay.  This study sought to find evidence for the use of methane and nitrogen by microbes in soil and groundwater.\n\nIt was found that nitrogen and methane can be detected throughout groundwater and streams.  It is expected that methane will only be produced in environments with no nitrogen, but methane reached high concentrations even when low amounts of nitrogen were present.  Since agriculture is the dominant source of nitrogen in the study region, this research determined the impact on nitrogen and methane when agriculture (and fertilization) stopped and the landscape was converted back to grassland or wetlands.  This research determined that groundwater nitrogen concentrations decrease rapidly (3-5 years) at the test sites when fertilization stops, which is faster than expected.  When farm plots were converted to wetlands or grasslands with occasional flooding, methane accumulated in groundwater and reached levels high enough to escape to the atmosphere in the summer months.  Methane was also found to accumulate naturally in streams draining watersheds with poor-draining soil.  Although it was not determined that one microbe was consuming methane and nitrogen, as hypothesized, many new insights were gained about the dynamics of nitrogen and methane in the agricultural landscape.          \n\nThis research has also trained one graduate student, Dana Bunnell-Young, who frequently taught classes and led outreach programs that informed the general public on local and global environmental and scientific issues. The results of this research will be summarized in Bunnell-Young?s dissertation and in journal articles.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dana E Bunnell-Young"
