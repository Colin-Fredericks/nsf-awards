 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2013. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Robert L. Baker is \"Genome wide Associations between Anatomy, Crop-specific Resource Allocation Strategies, and Water Use Efficiency.\" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Wyoming and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Cynthia Weinig and Brent Ewers.\r\n\r\nStomatal conductance, hydraulic conductance, and resource partitioning to roots, stems, and leaves are components of water-use efficiency (WUE), a critical determinant of crop yield. Understanding the genetic basis of anatomical and physiological changes that improve WUE is relevant globally as human population growth places increasing pressure on available water. Historically, there are three geographic centers of Brassica (B.) rapa cultivation (Europe, India, and Asia), each including two or more crop types: brocolettos, turnips, cabbages, and seed oils. B. rapa is an excellent model to link anatomy to WUE patterns because different organs are targeted for harvest among crop types, which exhibit characteristic differences in organ-specific water use and allocation.  This research investigates the genetic architecture of leaf, stem, and root anatomy, resource allocation, and gas exchange in diverse cultivars of B. rapa. The research includes collecting anatomical data through thin sections, quantifying whole-plant resource allocation, and developing single nucleotide polymorphism markers through next-generation sequencing. Genetic distances among crop types will be tested for correlations with phenotypic matrices of root, stem, and leaf structure to elucidate the anatomical features that contribute to differences in photosynthesis and conductance among crop types. Genome wide association studies will be used to catalogue specific genomic regions affecting anatomical phenotypes of interest.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics. Broader impacts include developing and implementing a durable training platform in histological techniques for undergraduates. One-on-one work with graduate and undergraduate students will provide for teaching and training opportunities while completing the proposed research.",
