Researchers are developing techniques for the virtualization software to protect users' privacy in cloud computing environments.  The research team plans to develop a demo version based on their technology and investigate its potential application for end-users.\r\n\r\nIf successfully implemented, this research could have impacts in research and education by enhancing the understanding of structural design to support user-controlled privacy protection in cloud computing. The proposed technology could make the deployment and configuration of cloud computing simpler.",
