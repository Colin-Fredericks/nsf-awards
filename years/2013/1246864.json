 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motion of tectonic plates at the surface of the earth is caused by forces within the earth's mantle: the push of positive buoyancy at spreading ridges and the pull of sinking plates (slabs) at subduction zones. At the earth's surface these forces result in earthquakes where the two plates slide past one another (plate boundaries). The ability of the force from sinking slabs to effectively pull tectonic plates behind them depends on how the slab deforms within the earth's mantle, which in turn depends on how its material properties change as it deforms. In addition, the total force associated with the sinking slab depends on changes in the crystal structure of the minerals (phase changes), which lead to changes in density within the slab.  Most of these phase changes occur between 410 and 660 km beneath the earth's surface, a region known as the transition zone. Ultimately, the deformation of the sinking slab inside the mantle is manifest in seismicity occurring within the slab to depths of 660 km beneath the earth's surface, and observables changes in plate motions at the earth's surface. The purpose of this study is determine, 1) how surface plate motions and the state of stress within surface plates react to, and provide feedbacks for, slab dynamics in the transition, 2) what is the origin of deep slab seismicity, and 3) if the observed shape of slabs is related to intrinsic properties of the subducting plate and plate boundary, or is instead a reflection of the time-dependent evolution of the slab. While the focus of this study is on deformation within the earth?s mantle, this deformation couples to the motions of plates at the earth's surface, which can cause destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.\r\n\r\nTo address these questions with will develop three-dimensional numerical models (simulations) of subduction dynamics. More specifically we will use the best laboratory and observational constraints on the mineral composition of the plate (the crust, the residual harzburgite and the mantle layers), phase transitions (including all major mineral components) and rheology of the plate and mantle. We will enable dynamically mobile plates and plate boundaries, which are essential for understanding the physical connection between slab deformation and surface plate motions. These models eliminate several simplifying assumptions used in previous studies allowing us to make connections between slab deformation and surface plate motions and slab seismicity. Model results will be compared to global data sets on slab shape, plate characteristics and kinematics, as well as regional seismic observations on the state of stress within slabs and seismic discontinuities (which occur at phase transitions) across subducting lithosphere. The results of this project will provide a much more complete and realistic understanding of the physical processes that control the deformation of slabs and their ability to pull tectonic plates, and insight into how slab seismicity is related to the larger scale deformation slabs. In addition, the research will support the training of a PhD student, contribute software to the modeling community, introduce undergraduate students to scientific research, and contribute to the material used in undergraduate instruction.",

The largest force acting on tectonic plates comes from the gravitational pull of a dense plate sinking into the mantle (called a slab) in a subduction zone. The magnitude of the force that is transmitted to the other tectonic plates at the surface depends on how the density of the slab changes with depth, the resistance to sinking caused by the surrounding rocks (viscous shear) and how the shape of the slab changes in time.&nbsp; This project approached this question in two ways.</p>\n<p>First, we conducted a detailed study of the three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the slab in the Tongan Subduction Zone. Using a virtual reality room, we analyzed the shape of the slab and how the state of stress in the slab (known from earthquake moment tensor solutions) varied with that shape (Fig 1A). This analysis revealed a particularly anomalous region, which appeared to be uplifted and stretch over a spherical structure (Fig 1B). After considering various hypothesis for the process that could lead to the observations, we concluded that this slab was being deformed by a small plume of hot material rising from the base of the transition zone (660 km depth). Numerical simulation have shown that such small-scale plumes are caused by hot material rising from deeper in the mantle through a phase change boundary. This conclusion is significant because it helps to explain why the Tonga slab is the most seismically active and has the fastest convergence rate in the world: the increased resistance to sinking caused by the hot rising material directly under the slab, and the in situ destruction of the slab by the small-scale plume. This study resulted in a Masters Thesis, and the observations with which to test a future numerical model of our preferred hypothesis. If our hypothesis is correct, it would suggest that small-scale processes in the mantle (often invisible to seismic tomography) are more prevalent and have a bigger effect on the stresses within tectonic plates. An undergraduate student was also trained in the 3D virtual analysis and completed a global survey of the slabs to be analyzed and described in a publication that is in preparation.</p>\n<p>Second, we conducted a systematic study of how the density structure caused by phase transitions affect the deformation of the slab and motion of tectonic plates at the surface. While we had initially planned this study to also use 3D models, we found the dynamics sufficiently complex in 2D that we limited the study to 2D models. In contrast to previous simulations of subduction our models included a more physically realistic and complete description of the composition of the plate and phase transitions occurring in the upper mantle. We found this improvement to have significant impact on the speed of the tectonic plates at the surface and their propensity for buckling or folding or breaking (Fig 2). Our models show that an observed spike in plate speeds for slabs just entering the transition zone is due to sudden increase in the slab density from the phase transitions (Fig 3). The phase transitions also lead to more buckling and folding of the slab, and require that the slab be stronger to avoid breaking off completely (Fig 4). We also showed that the volcanic arc above a subduction zone can be split apart due to an instability in the system caused by accumulation of weak crustal material between the subducting and overriding plate (Fig 5). Splitting of the volcanic arc has occurred in the past in both the Mariana and Tonga subduction zones. Finally, we showed that the motion of the trench itself depends not only on the local forces acting on the slab, but also on far-field forces such as a ridge-push force on the overriding plate side. Specifically we found that this additional force is needed to balance the ridge-push force on the subducting plate side and only with this balance can we reproduce the observe proportion of time spent in trench advance versus trench retreat (Fig. 6). There is more information to be gleaned from these simulations. Specifically we will also analyze the stress orientations and magnitudes predicted from the models with global observations. This analysis may allow us to identify regions where slabs are actively folding and buckling today. Understanding this process will allow us to more fully quantify the balance of forces acting on tectonic plates and the stresses acting on plate boundaries. This part of the project resulted in a PhD Thesis, one paper already published and three papers currently in preparation for publication.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Magali&nbsp;I&nbsp;Billen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246864/1246864_10226476_1486044252226_fig5_outcome--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246864/1246864_10226476_1486044252226_fig5_outcome--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Splitting of the Volcanic Arc Region\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246864/1246864_10226476_1486044252226_fig5_outcome--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Splitting of the Volcanic Arc Region\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 5.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">K.
