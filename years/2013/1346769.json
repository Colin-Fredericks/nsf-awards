 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel programming has become increasingly common with the advent of\r\n\"multi-core\" computer chips that pack many processors into a single\r\nchip. Most standard laptop and desktop computers now come with anywhere\r\nfrom two to thirty-two such cores. Such chips offer unprecedented computing power, but at a price: to\r\nextract their full potential, programmers writing software for the new\r\nchips must use special programming language \"libraries\" in order to\r\nspecify how the program is to do two (or more) things at once. One\r\npopular such library is called OpenMP. These so-called parallel\r\nprograms are notoriously difficult to get right, and many contain\r\nundetected defects (\"bugs\") that can cause the program to crash or\r\nproduce incorrect results.\r\n\r\nThe CIVL project has the potential to dramatically reduce the effort\r\nrequired to develop new static analysis tools. The key idea is a\r\nunified language for describing parallel programs, whether these use\r\nMPI, OpenMP, or both. One tool translates the original program into\r\nthe new language, also called CIVL. Other tools perform static\r\nanalysis on the CIVL program. Eventually, many other parallel\r\nlibraries will be added to the new system. The advantage of this\r\napproach is that the designer of a new static analysis tool need only\r\ndesign the tool for a single language---CIVL---but then gets a tool\r\nthat works on all the source libraries \"for free\". Similarly, when a\r\nnew parallel library comes along, by developing a translator from it\r\nto CIVL, one can immeidately reap the benefits of all the static\r\nanalysis tools. The researchers expect that the resulting platform\r\nwill make it much easier to develop correct parallel programs, no\r\nmatter how that parallelism is expressed.",
