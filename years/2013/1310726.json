 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Richard Galvez of Syracuse University to conduct a research project in MPS during the summer of 2013 at University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.  The project title is \"What Happened Immediately after Cosmic Inflation? A Novel Analysis of the Unknown Era of the Expansion of the Universe.\" The host scientist is Professor Richard Easther.\r\n\r\nDue to modern experiments such as NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck, the expansion history of the universe from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era until today is very well understood to remarkable precision. The expansion history before BBN however is still a mystery. If one assumes cosmic inflation to take place in the very early universe (around a fraction of a second after the Big Bang) can experimental results from Planck and WMAP constrain what happened during this time? And, if so, to what extent? This is the question this project is addressing.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Upon return to Syracuse University, the Fellow will use the research and experience gained during the EAPSI fellowship to mentor two undergraduate students on a research project with the goal of introducing these students to modern practices in academic research and various topics in theoretical physics and cosmology. The Fellow will also organize an EAPSI workshop for other graduate students across STEM fields about his experiences and encourage others from Syracuse University to apply. The Fellow is also giving seminars at universities in NZ to disseminate information gathered in his project thus far. In addition, the Fellow plans to present research findings at academic conferences in the 2013-2014 academic year as well as as a series of seminars planned in Nicaragua.",
