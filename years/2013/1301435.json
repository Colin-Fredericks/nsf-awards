 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is about developing a universal surface modification method applicable to any surface, irrespective of surface chemistry or material characteristics. At present, each surface modification method is specific to only a certain type of surface. Such a universal surface modification method does not exist. The objective of this work is to perform a systematic and fundamental study of catechol surface binding via physical or/and chemical forces and to develop a simple, robust, and universal surface coating method. The approach of this research will be to attach a well-characterized polymer, consisting of one functional moiety and one surface-adhesive moiety, to a surface. The surface-adhesive moiety will be based on a catechol group, which in principle can be attached to any type of surface, particularly in the presence of amine groups. The functional moiety will be based on a zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (PCB) polymer, since this is the most challenging surface coating problem due to PCB being highly hydrated in aqueous solutions. This universal coating will be tested on a number of surfaces ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, including noble metals, metals, polymers, and semiconductors. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include (a) a fundamental understanding of how chemical and physical forces interplay to achieve surface coatings that are stable and have a high packing density and (b) a new surface modification strategy applicable for attaching any kind of functional polymer to any surface. It will have significant impact in a wide range of applications from medical devices to consumer products. Underrepresented undergraduate and community college researchers will be recruited through well-established outreach programs. This project will also provide opportunities for high school students and teachers for summer research and for visiting students and professors. The PI has been actively involved in international collaborations at national and university levels and is organizing the first international conference on bio-inspired and zwitterionic materials to be held in December 2013.",
