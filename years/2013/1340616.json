This year's 2013 USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies, called HealthTech13, will be held in conjunction with the annual USENIX Security conference in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 12, 2013. Its focus differs from previous USENIX workshops on HIT by its broader scope that is intended to encourage the development of new technologies that generally improve the quality and safety of healthcare, as well as the access to it. The workshop audience is similarly broadened to encourage greater cross-disciplinary engagement by researchers and practitioners in technology, medicine, and policy communities across academia, government and industry. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will offer several means by which participants can interact and engage. In addition to keynote and technical research presentations, there will be a poster session and a best research paper award, which will both be a first for this workshop series, and a continuation of last year's successful session for announcing research progress on hard problems. The topics to be covered in HealthTech13 include architectures for large-scale health information systems, and health information exchanges, medical devices and body area networks, home and assisted living monitoring systems, privacy enhancing technologies, regulatory and policy issues, telemedicine, and mobile health technologies, among others.",
