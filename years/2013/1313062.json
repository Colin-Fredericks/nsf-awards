 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence is mounting that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal \"Inflation\" of a sub-nuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of Inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with an amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor to scalar modes, r = T/S. Many slow-roll models of Inflation produce r ~ 0.01?0.1, corresponding to peak CMB fluctuations of 30?100 nK rms on degree angular scales.  Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as \"the most exciting quest of all\", and emphasized that \"mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB\". In 2005, the Task Force on CMB Research identified this as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity of r = 0.02. The ongoing BICEP/BICEP2/SPUD series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. They began operating at the South Pole Station (Antarctica) in 2006 and are relentlessly mapping an 800-deg2 region of the sky that uniquely low in Galactic foregrounds - the so-called Southern Hole. The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of this project is to complete the BICEP3 instrument and  make observations of degree-scale CMB polarization with unprecedented  sensitivity at 95 GHz.  The BICEP-Keck program is optimized for  controlling systematic errors at degree angular scales, where the  inflationary polarization signal peaks.  BICEP3's high sensitivity at 95 GHz is key to improving our limits on  the inflationary polarization signal.  Current measurements are limited  by measurement errors on Galactic foregrounds, particularly polarized  dust emission.  For example, errors on inflationary polarization are ~5  times higher than the raw statistical sensitivity we have at 150 GHz,  due to errors in foreground removal.  New data at 95 GHz in conjunction  with our existing measurements at 150 GHz are key to improving these  errors, adding another sensitivity CMB band with a lower dust  contribution.\n\nBICEP3 represents a significant technological advance in CMB polarimeter technology.  By incorporating a new high-throughput refracting telescope, BICEP3 provides approximately 15 times the light-gathering power of an earlier-generation Keck Array receiver.  New technology focal plane modules, developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, combine superconducting detectors with multiplexed SQUID readouts in a 3-D hybrized compact package.  These modules can be tiled to arbitary sizes, and 20 were combined in BICEP3's large focal plane.\n\nBICEP3 was developed by a diverse group of young scientists, graduate students and postdocs, who bore significant respsonsibility for the design and execution of the experiment.  This hands-on experience forms an irreplacable part of their training as future experimental scientists.\n\nBICEP3 observed in the 2015 season at sub-optimal sensitivity.  The 2015  observations allowed us to assess the receiver performance, and was  useful to identify RF pickup from the station transmitters.  The  receiver was substantially upgraded for 2016, improving the thermal  performance, reducing polarization from the optics, mitigating the RF  response, and outfitting a full focal plane.  Data from 2016 is of  science quality, and currently under analysis.  The receiver was further  improved for 2017, replacing delaminated filters in the focal plane,  improving the thermal filter stack to reduce its photon loading, and  replacing several of the lowest performing detector modules.  The 2017  performance meets our expectations and we expect to continue  observations into the future on a different grant without significant  changes to the instrument.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James J Bock"
