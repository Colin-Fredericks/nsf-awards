 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Kev Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Tim Tait at the University of California, Irvine.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of a Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the recent wealth of cosmological results, this is an exciting time in particle physics and cosmology.  Data from the LHC and other particle physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the weak scale with unprecedented detail.  At the same time, outstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work on physics beyond the so-called \"Standard Model\", and the interaction of cosmology and particle physics in recent years has been fruitful.  The research plan of these researchers exploits innovative ideas in both particle physics and cosmology in order to address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, collider phenomenology, neutrino physics, grand unified theories, dark matter, and particle cosmology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the group's activities are directed towards increasing public interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting results of particle physics. These include public talks and outreach activities, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional service.",
