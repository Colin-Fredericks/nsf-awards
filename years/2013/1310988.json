 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Forest Hoyt Andrews of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.  The project title is \"Exploring the Diversity of the Oxidative Folding Pathway via X-ray Crystallography.\" The host scientist is Professor Se Won Suh. \r\n\r\nOxidative folding is the process of introducing disulfide bonds into proteins. In most bacteria this pathway is essentially composed of two enzymes that form a complex.  However the way in which these two enzymes have evolved to interact with one another is not quite as conserved as originally thought. This project performs cocrystallization experiments on these various oxidative folding enzyme partners in an attempt to identify novel interactions.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  In addition to the planned research, the Fellow will visit local high schools and observe how teaching science is approached in Korea and compare it to his experience teaching high school science in the US. Upon returning the Fellow will hold an open seminar describing the cultural differences and educational approaches in teaching science between the United States and Korea.",
