 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nWorking together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders.",

The tectonically active G-B delta, with 150 million people and a vast, low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great risk due to&nbsp;<em>i)&nbsp;</em>increased flooding and submergence under sea-level rise scenarios,&nbsp;<em>ii)&nbsp;</em>earthquakes and river avulsions due to tectonic deformation, and&nbsp;<em>iii)&nbsp;</em>decreased sediment loads due to damming/water redistribution in the drainage basin. Although these risks are widely recognized, our scientific understanding of the local conditions and processes within this, and other, complex deltaic landscapes is incomplete yet essential to effective and realistic management of these regions.<br /><br />In this study we directed our focus on the dispersal of sediment within the G-B delta, which is essential to maintaining the elevation of the landscape above rising sea level. In particular, this coast has large tides that convey a tremendous volume of water and sediment through the river channels and onto the land. Our measurements of these exchanges are used to determine how quickly the land can build vertically to offset sea-level rise and subsidence (sinking) of the land. These determinations will help guide long-term planning strategies for the government of Bangladesh and the 25 million people that live in this low-lying coastal setting. Results are published in a high-profile paper in the journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em> (Auerbach et al., 2015).<br /><br />We also investigated major changes to the landscape and channel networks, which are being driven by anthropogenic alterations of the environment. To protect people and agriculture from flooding, the US and other international aid agencies funded the construction of embankments that were built around the tidal islands in the 1960s and 1970s. &nbsp;One of the long-term effects has been changes to the tides and tidal channels, which have led to the infilling of over 600 kilometers of major waterways.
