The models will be constrained by direct images of exoplanets produced by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and other surveys.  The researchers will focus on non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud physics, atmospheric structure and predict emission spectra of the planets.  They will also use the direct imaging data to determine atmospheric effective temperature, surface gravity and composition.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include contributions to university public web pages on science topics, videos called Science Bulletin Features produced by the American Museum of Natural History, and mentoring and supervising a female graduate student in her Ph.D. dissertation research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nClouds in planetary atmospheres have a significant impact on the absorption, reflection, and emission of light.  In the Solar System we have long experience with the behavior clouds of water on Earth, clouds of ammonia in the visible atmosphere on Jupiter, and photochemical hazes on Saturn's moon Titan.  However, outside the solar system, our intuition for clouds can fail.  The role of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres in perhaps the source of our greatest uncertainty regarding these extrasolar worlds.\n\nVery hot planets above 1300 K can have \"rock dust\" clouds that have been well studied in brown dwarfs for nearly 20 years.  In cooler objects, different molecules condense to form clouds, such as \"salt clouds,\" like KCl, and sulfide clouds, like Na2S.  Eventually below ~400 K water clouds arise as well. \n\nOver the course of our grant we have aimed to create a new generation of atmosphere models for planets and include the effects on clouds.  Theatmosphere models involve the calculation of the light emitted, reflected, and absorbed by planets, which can be directly observed for planets around other stars.  Through a series of papers we have show how salt/sulfide and water clouds effect young planets that glow infrared thermal emission.   Planets that are close to their parent star can be seen to pass directly in front of them, or \"transit,\" and we can measure the stellar light transmitted through a planet's atmosphere.  We have also calculated how these same clouds effect this transmitted light, which has been confirmed by numerous observations.  Over the past 3 years the models that we calculated have been the standard reference for the field.\n\nThis grant has partially supported the work of two graduate students, who have now received their PhDs, and a postdoctoral scholar who has now obtained a tenure-track faculty position.  Several undergraduate students also worked with these young scientists.  The undergraduates gained valuable research experience and the graduate students and postdoc learned mentorship and leadership skills.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan J Fortney"
