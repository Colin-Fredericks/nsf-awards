 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nBacteria that can colonize multi-cellular organisms live in or on their hosts as part of complex communities.  They use specific surface proteins to adhere to one another, and to host cells, to form a stable community of bacteria that are not washed away.  In this research, mentored undergraduate students, will identify and characterize protein colonization factors and determine how they interact with one another.  Hra1 was previously described as a member of the agglutinin family of outer surface proteins which by self-association mediates adjacent bacterial cells to adhere to one another.  Hra1 also mediates in vivo binding of Escherichia coli to eukaryotic cells and specifically promotes colonization of nematode worm intestines in small aggregates.   There is preliminary evidence that suggests that a second protein, Aap, prevents Hra1 mediated interactions.  The inhibitory activity of Aap provides a mechanism for restricting Hra1 mediated associations as bacteria travel towards their intestinal niche.  Once bacteria reach a suitable niche however, Aap must be removed for colonization to ensue.  This research, will determine the mechanism for Aap removal and thus how Hra1 and Aap work together to ensure that bacteria can bind and disperse in a manner that optimizes colonization of nematode intestines.  The project will also identify new surface factors involved in intestinal colonization and determine how, if at all, they interact with known surface proteins.  In addition to identifying proteins involved in binding among identical bacteria, the project will focus on uncovering surface proteins that allow different species of bacteria to interact with one another, as a first step to understanding community organization among the many types of bacteria living within a single multi-cellular organism.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nBacteria are the most abundant life-forms on earth and colonize a wide variety of living and non-living niches by mechanisms that are not very well understood. This project will improve current understanding of how communities of bacteria are established and persist within other organisms, as well as add to knowledge on the structure and function of bacterial surface proteins.  The research required to address questions relevant to this project will largely be performed by undergraduate students working at Haverford College and overseen by a principal investigator, who teaches there.  The project will provide early opportunities for such students with the hope of increasing their interest and retention in science.  Four to eight students, including women and other groups underrepresented in the sciences will be engaged in laboratory research projects each year.  Several dozen other students will be enriched by course modules and classroom examples in courses that are developed and taught by the principal investigator.  This includes 20-40 students who will participate in inquiry-based laboratory research courses each year that will expose them to skills in microbiology, molecular biology and computational science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nEnteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are exceptional colonizers of the human intestine that we use to model the process of colonization.  This project characterized known colonization factors and identified new ones.  Our studies on an outer membrane protein, Hra1 support a structure in which the protein loops out of and into the outer membrane of bacteria that express it four times.  We were able to identify colonization motifs on surface exposed loops of this protein involved in bacteria-bacteria aggregation and to show that one of these motifs accounts for this function in an entirely unrelated protein. We went on to study the interactions among different factors on the surface of the cell.  EAEC attach via multiple proteins and structures including long appendages called fimbriae and the surface protein Hra1.  EAEC also secrete an anti-adherence protein known as dispersin, which remains loosely attached to the cell surface.  This study showed that dispersin masks Hra1, such that EAEC adherence in the laboratory is largely the product of fimbriae.  When the bacteria colonize worms, dispersin is removed, so that Hra1-mediated adherence predominates.  All three factors &ndash;fimbriae, dispersin and Hra1 - are required for optimal colonization. Cooperative interplay among multiple colonization factors may be an essential feature of exceptional colonizers.\n\nIn the course of this research, we determined that certain chemicals can interfere with colonization and also identified novel contributors to colonization through genetic screens.  These include genes that appear to encode previously undescribed fimbriae and toxic proteins produced by one E. coli strain that kill others and thereby grant exceptional colonizers a competitive advantage.\n\nBroader impact:\n\nThis work has provided valuable new information on bacterial factors that permit interactions of these microbes with humans and other animals.  Two scientific papers detailing the discoveries from this project have been published and three others are in development.  Twelve of the co-authors on the two published papers were undergraduates when they worked on the research published therein.  The PI also co-authored an undergraduate textbook during the period of this award which drew on her experiences of teaching and mentoring research students, and co-taught discovery-based laboratory classes that contributed to this research.\n\nThe work was largely performed by mentored students, fourteen of them undergraduates, who learned how to responsibly conduct of research in microbiology and genetics.  This includes learning techniques for manipulating bacteria, designing, performing and validating screens as well as the generation and mapping of DNA sequence and reporting findings in the scientific literature.  A full half of the 18 students working on the project were female and 8 students belonged to ethic groups under-represented in the sciences.  All six of the graduate researchers that worked on the project, including the PI, were female and/or from underrepresented groups. 5 have already gone onto graduate programs in the sciences or health care and one holds a Fulbright fellowship.  The study also forged collaborative links among investigators in the US, the UK and Nigeria.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Fairman"
