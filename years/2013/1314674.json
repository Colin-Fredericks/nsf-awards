 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both sound software verification techniques and heuristic software\r\nflaw-finding tools benefit from the presence of software annotations\r\nthat describe the behavior of software components. Function summaries\r\n(in the form of logical annotations) allow modular checking of software\r\nand more precise reasoning. However, such annotations are difficult to\r\nwrite and not commonly produced by software developers, despite their\r\nbenefits to static analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Crowdsourcing Annotations project will address this deficiency by\r\nencouraging software-community-based crowd-sourced generation of\r\nannotations.  This effort will be supported by tools that generate, use,\r\nand translate the annotations; the results of annotation efforts will be\r\nshared through openly available repositories. We will also use pilot\r\nprojects to demonstrate and encourage the use of annotations and static\r\nanalysis. The project will leverage and interact with the Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP)\r\nproject's collection of static analysis tools and example software. Some\r\nof the technical challenges are developing uniform styles and languages\r\nfor annotations, reliably validating crowd-sourced submissions, merging\r\nannotations and the corresponding source code, version control, and\r\nintegration with typical software development environments. The social\r\nchallenges are also important: designing and implementing a\r\ncrowd-sourcing infrastructure in a way that enhances and motivates\r\ncommunity and individual technical and social benefits.",
