Besides technical paper presentations, Sensys, through this grant, will be able to stimulate several intellectual activities by students. Furthermore, the conference offers several opportunities for intellectually stimulating discussions between the students and researchers from around the world. \r\n\r\nThe participation of students in Sensys can have an important impact on their development as a junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.",
