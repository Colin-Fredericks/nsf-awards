 "awd_abstract_narration": "Males, but not females, of many animal species possess ?ornaments,? conspicuous traits that function mainly in a social context. In some species, however, females also display conspicuous ornaments, resulting in reduced sexual dimorphism. Such mutually shared ornaments have long been thought to evolve in females mainly as a byproduct of selection on males, owing to the expression of the same genes in both sexes?the ?genetic correlation? hypothesis.  However, little is known about the genetic basis of female ornaments. The proposed research seeks to understand the genetic basis of a female ornament, red throat coloration, in the threespine stickleback fish. The red throat coloration of male sticklebacks is well studied; thus, the recent discovery of this trait in females of some populations creates a research opportunity. In the proposed work, Quantitative Trait Loci mapping will be used to identify genomic regions associated with female and male throat coloration for crosses between populations with and without red-throated females, enabling a test of the genetic correlation hypothesis.  \r\n\r\nSexual dimorphism is increasingly thought of as an important aspect of biodiversity. Thus this study will improve understanding of the genetic basis of a poorly explored aspect of animal diversity. Because sex differences are associated with variation in the onset, prevalence, and severity of many diseases, an improved understanding of the evolutionary genetics of sexual dimorphism may also have medical value. This project will contribute to the training of students from under-represented groups and will be featured in outreach efforts.",

In particular, what are the genetic mechanisms that control differences in form and shape between males and females? Answering this question is critical for our understanding of how sexual dimorphism evolves at a genetic level and how such genetic variation might contribute to sex differences in the onset, prevalence, and severity of many illnesses in humans. To tackle this question, we studied variation in sex-specific traits found in natural populations. In many animals, males possess elaborate traits (color or exaggerated appendages), which function to attract mates and intimidate rivals, but are often absent in females. In some species, however, females can also display elaborate traits similar to those found in males. Unlike in males, such traits might serve no function in females. Instead, the expression of male-like traits in females may be non-adaptive, the result of male-typical genes being present and expressed in females.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To test a key assumption of this hypothesis, we used threespine stickleback fish (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>) in an investigation of the genetic basis of a colorful and male-typical trait&mdash;red throat coloration.

To characterize the genetic architecture of throat color, we conducted a genetic study using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, identifying the genomic locations and/or chromosomal regions that contribute to the expression of the red throat in both the males and females. The study spanned almost 3 years, which involved generating numerous stickleback offspring (2 generations and 600 fish) and genotyping them with state-of-the art genomic tools, which were funded through the NSF dissertation improvement award. Consistent with our predictions and the genetic correlation hypothesis, we found that the throat coloration in both sexes results from a common genetic architecture, mapping to similar chromosomal regions on the stickleback genome. Additionally, we have found evidence that another conspicuous red trait, spine color, maps to one region shared with throat color, suggesting that the same chromosomal region is responsible for the presence of two different red traits.
