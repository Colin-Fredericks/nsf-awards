This relation connects the mass (M) of the central black hole in galaxies to the velocity dispersion (sigma) of the stars in the galactic bulge, and allows an estimate of M from determination of sigma, the latter being a fairly easily measured quantity.  This program will determine the scaling factor between the two quantities.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students, and outreach via workshops for local high school teachers in astrophysical research to be used in the classroom.",

This program simultaneously studies the local relations of so-called active galaxies as well as their evolution with cosmic time. Active galaxies are galaxies with a massive BH in the center that is currently growing through accretion. This research focuses on a population of low-luminous, low-massive active galaxies known as Seyfert galaxies. Results have been published in 7 scientific papers. The main results can be summarized as follows.<br /><br />(1) For a local sample of ~100 Seyfert-1 galaxies, we analyzed SDSS images and high-quality long-slit Keck spectra to study the relation between the mass of the supermassive BH and their host galaxy properties. Using spatially-resolved stellar-velocity dispersion (sigma_star) measurements, we find that sigma_star can vary on average by up to 40% across definitions commonly used in the literature, emphasizing the importance of self-consistent definitions in comparisons and evolutionary studies. The MBH-sigma_star relation for our Seyfert-1 galaxies has the same intercept and scatter as that of reverberation-mapped AGNs as well as quiescent galaxies, consistent with the hypothesis that our single-epoch MBH estimator and sample selection do not introduce significant biases. Barred galaxies, merging galaxies, and those hosting pseudo bulges do not represent outliers in the MBH-sigma_star relation. This is in contrast with previous work, although no firm conclusion can be drawn due to the limited resolution of the SDSS images.<br /><br />(2) We take advantage of the high S/N of the Keck spectra for our local Seyfert-1 sample to probe whether the width of the strong optical [OIII] lambda 5007A narrow emission line can be used as a surrogate for sigma_star. When line asymmetries from non-gravitational gas motion are excluded in a double Gaussian fit, the average ratio between the core [OIII] width and sigma_star is ~1, but with individual data points off by up to a factor of two. The resulting black-hole-mass [OIII]-width relation scatters around that of quiescent galaxies and reverberation-mapped AGNs. However, a direct comparison between core [OIII] width and sigma_star shows no close correlation, only that both quantities have the same range, average, and standard deviation, probably because they feel the same gravitational potential. The large scatter is likely due to the fact that line profiles are a luminosity-weighted average, dependent on the light distribution and underlying kinematic field. Our results strongly caution against the use of [OIII] width as a surrogate for sigma_star on an individual basis. <br /><br />(3) When studying profile changes of the broad optical Hbeta emission line within the ~3-9 year time-frame between SDSS spectra and Keck spectra, we find at least some form of broad-line variability (in either width or flux) in the majority (66%) of the objects, resulting in a Seyfert-type change for 38% of the objects, likely driven by variable accretion and/or obscuration. The broad Hbeta line disappears in 3/102 (3%) extreme cases. We discuss potential causes for these changing-look AGNs. While similar dramatic transitions have previously been reported in the literature, either on a case-by-case basis or in larger samples focusing on quasars at higher redshifts, our study provides statistical information on the frequency of Hbeta line variability in a sample of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies.<br /><br />(4) Gemini/NIRI observations were obtained for a sub-sample of 15 Seyfert-1 galaxies selected for their wide variety of host galaxies.
