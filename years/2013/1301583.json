In the last ten years, ergodic theory has developed and spread into new directions. New applications of ergodic theory have developed, techniques have been imported to the subject, and multiple connections have been developed with other areas of mathematics. Particularly strong connections with combinatorics and number theory have been developed, leading to an explosion of activity. In addition to focusing on recent developments and new open problems, the meeting will bring together mathematicians that use ergodic theory to solve problems in combinatorics and number theory.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support participation in the conference for mathematicians based in the United States. It is expected that most world experts in ergodic theory with a combinatorial or number theoretic flavor will be present at this conference, as well as numerous more junior Israeli and European participants. As such, it represents a unique opportunity to make new connections and progress in ergodic theory. It will be of substantial benefit to the US participants in terms of stimulating international collaboration and enhancing the advancement of US mathematics. Graduate students, junior faculty, and underrepresented groups in mathematics who do not have access to other travel funds will be given priority for funding.",
