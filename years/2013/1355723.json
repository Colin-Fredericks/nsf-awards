 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysts in all areas of human knowledge, from science and engineering\r\nto economics, social science and journalism are drowning in data. The\r\nproliferation of digital information requires tools and techniques for\r\nexploring, analyzing and communicating data in a manner that scales as\r\nboth the data and the organizations analyzing it grow in\r\nsize. Throughout the data life-cycle, sensemaking is often a\r\ncollaborative process. As different analysts each contribute to data\r\nacquisition, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation they contribute\r\ncontextual knowledge that deepens understanding. Analysts may disagree\r\non how to interpret data, but then work together to reach\r\nconsensus. Many data sets are so large that thorough exploration by a\r\nsingle person is unlikely. In short, social cognition plays a critical\r\nrole in the process of scalable data analysis. New analysis tools that\r\naddress human cognitive characteristics, social interaction and data\r\nanalytics in an integrated fashion can improve our ability to turn\r\ndata into knowledge.\r\n\r\nScalable data analysis requires social interaction and therefore\r\nsocial context must be embedded in data analysis tools. The goals of\r\nthis project are (1) to understand how social interaction and social\r\ncontext can facilitate successful data analysis, (2) to develop models\r\nand tools for representing and annotating data transformations,\r\nvisualizations, and social activity (e.g., textual and graphical\r\nannotations, discussions, links, tags), and (3) to design and test\r\nvisual interfaces that leverage our tools to support collaborative\r\nanalysis practices, including data entry, transformation,\r\nvisualization, and interpretation. Central concerns include (a) a\r\nfocus on enabling social interaction throughout the data life-cycle\r\nand (b) the use of scalable data transformation routines that can\r\nreturn results in a time frame concordant with interactive,\r\nexploratory data transformation and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information on this project can be found at: \r\nhttp://vis.berkeley.edu/projects/scalable_social_data_analysis/",
