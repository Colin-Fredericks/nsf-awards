 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating\r\nSystems (ASPLOS) is a premier multi-disciplinary conference for research that spans the boundaries\r\nof hardware, computer architecture, compilers, languages, operating systems, networking, and\r\napplications. ASPLOS provides a high quality forum for scientists and engineers to present\r\ntheir latest research findings in these rapidly changing fields. It has captured some of the\r\nmajor computer systems innovations of the past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors,\r\nsmall and large-scale multiprocessors, clusters and networks-of-workstations, optimizing compilers,\r\nRAID, and network-storage system designs). This proposal aims to support this highly regarded\r\nconference by obtaining travel funds to help students defray the costs of attending the conference\r\nin March 2013 in Houston, Texas USA. Priority will be given to those students who will present their \r\nresearch at ASPLOS or its joint workshops, and to women and other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will have two primary direct benefits in terms of broader impact. First, the\r\nASPLOS conference will be strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel\r\nsupport will enable. Second, those students receiving travel support will personally benefit\r\nfrom the opportunity to engage in the all-important technical, professional, and social exchanges\r\nthat ASPLOS fosters.\r\n\r\nWe also expect this proposal to have two additional indirect impacts. First, we plan to widely\r\nadvertise the available support in order to attract women and under-represented minority groups\r\nin attendance. Second, by providing this support expressly to students, we expect to increase\r\nstudent participation in the conference. We anticipate that the research results presented\r\nat the conference -- as well as the emphasis on interaction between researchers in academia\r\nand industry -- will be carried back by attendees to their home institutions, resulting in\r\nheightened awareness and interests in multidisciplinary research in computer architectures,\r\nprogramming languages, and operating systems.",
