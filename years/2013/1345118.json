A synthesis method is proposed that naturally provides embedded nanoparticles within a magnesium silicide alloy matrix, providing uniform mixing with minimal aggregation. With the use of embedded nanoparticles of appropriate concentration and diameter, thermal conductivity will be reduced by scattering of mid-long-wavelength phonons. Controlling the heterostructure band offset and the potential barrier of nanoparticles with respect to the matrix, the power factor will be increased by selective scattering of hot carriers. Preliminary transport calculations show that ZT>1.8 at 800K could be achieved. Extensive characterization of the material thermoelectric properties will be performed and the results will be benched marked with collaborators at NASA JPL and BSST.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This proposal seeks to provide fundamental knowledge which can have a major impact on waste heat recovery. Benefiting from the careful optimization of the electron and phonon transport achieved in eptiaxially grown nanoparticle in alloy material and focusing on scalable bulk material synthesis and spark plasma sintering, the plan is to develop a low cost, high performance thermoelectric material. \r\n\r\nThe close collaboration between co-PIs with background in chemistry and engineering will provide a great learning opportunity for graduate students working on the project. Students will present their research at national and international meetings and will develop an appreciation for the complexity of materials development. The PIs have a history of participation in underrepresented minority outreach programs, supervising minority students and trainees, and participating in a broad array of activities.",
