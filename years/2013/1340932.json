 "awd_abstract_narration": "High performance data networks are critical infrastructure for researchers and educators who rely on unimpeded access to remote instrumentation, massive data sets and distant collaborators to achieve objectives in science and engineering fields. This project builds a high-performance research network at the University of Dayton to provide unimpeded connections to other research institutions via state and national high-capacity networks. The project expands the campus network from 1Gb to 10Gb and establishes science DMZs in four science and engineering facilities across the campus, providing researchers with new capabilities. Research initiatives link researchers with colleagues and students for: (1) education and outreach initiatives at Sinclair Community College and regional high schools, (2) remote instrumentation access at The Ohio State University, (3) climate research remote processing at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, and (4) collaborative sensors research at Central State University (a historically black university). This network expansion connects the University at 10Gbps to Internet2 and OARnet's IntraOhio (both running at 100Gbps). Additionally, the University of Dayton is utilizing perfSONAR monitoring to measure and document the performance of the science DMZs.\r\n\r\nThe key upgrades for this project include installing science DMZ edge hardware and upgrading distribution and access layers at the University of Dayton, and hardware upgrades for science DMZ connections at Central State University. These improvements enable our scientists and engineers to better connect, collaborate, and share science data, provide robust STEM educational outreach, contribute to high-value workforce development and create cost-effective models for sharing scarce scientific resources.",
