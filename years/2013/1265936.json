The eleventh occurrence of this conference will take place during July 1-5, 2013, at the University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.   \r\n \r\nThe topics of the conference are permutation patterns and, more generally, the concept of pattern in mathematical objects such as partitions, words, and other structures such as genome sequences.  The study of permutation patterns has emerged as a significant branch of enumerative combinatorics over the past couple of decades.  This is a subject of global interest; permutation patterns research is active in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.  The number of graduate students who have attended the last five meetings is another indication that research in this subject area is growing.  This grant supports travel to the conference by students and early career mathematicians from the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded travel by students and early career mathematicians to the Permutation Patterns 2013 conference.  This conference is the main annual conference in the area of permutation patterns, which addresses important questions in both mathematics and computer science.  Research in this area is international, and the conference brought together researchers from Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America.  Travel for 9 students and 5 early career mathematicians at US institutions was partially funded by this grant; it is likely that none of these participants would have been able to attend without such support.\n\nParticipation at this conference introduced the student participants to the wide range of research in the area of permutation patterns as well as the global network of researchers in the area.  Discussions at the conference have helped various individuals advance their own research and also led to several new international collaborations, the results of which will likely appear in the mathematical literature in the next several years.  A special issue of the Journal of Combinatorics with papers on work presented at the conference as well as other related work is in process.\n\nThe community studying permutation patterns is friendly to women, underrepresented minorities, and research at primarily undergraduate institutions, including research with and by undergraduates.  Hence this project contributes to broadening participation in mathematical research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Woo"
