  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this grant was to fund a NSF project showcase at the  ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) SIGCSE (the Special Interest  Group in Computer Science Education) annual conference for four years  (2014 through 2018).  This showcase had two primary goals.\n \n The  first goal was to allow twenty individuals (or teams) with current and  active NSF grants to present their research and results during the  conference.  This allowed for dissemination of their work to the wider  computer science education community.  Additionally, it allowed the  presenters to connect with potential collaborators who could aid their  research goals, or individuals who might use their work -- either while  said work was being developed or after it was completed.\n \n The  second goal was to allow potential grant writers to speak one on one  with NSF program officers.  They were able to ask questions about their  grant idea, get writing tips, and learn how to better align their idea  with the goals of the repsective call for proposals.  Multiple NSF  program officers held \"office hours\" during the conference that  attendees signed up for.\n\nPost-conference surveys indicated that  the participants felt that the showcase helped them further their  research either through through dissemination or by finding  collaborators or users.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron S Bloomfield"
