 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the University of Maryland, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Yale University to advance the theory of formation, fueling, and feedback of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).  The project proposes to accomplish this task by linking computational codes simulating large-scale SMBH phenomena (i.e. cosmological gravitational collapse and AGN jets) to the small-scale phenomena (i.e. SMBH formation and feedback on galactic structure).  For the \"formation stage\", the project intends to answer the question of how the first black hole (BH) seeds formed within the early universe by numerically simulating the coupling of large-scale baryonic structures and dark-matter halos to small-scale collapse of primordial gas disks into massive BH seeds.  For the \"fueling stage\" the project aims to explore the growth of the BH seed into a SMBH from galaxy-scale accretion flows to SMBH mergers.  Finally, for the \"feedback stage\" the goal is to explore the mechanisms by which the SMBHs at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGN) couple to the inter-cluster plasma on cosmological scales.  The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs.  The project will communicate results to the public through development of a 3-D visualization taking the viewer on a journey to witness the birth and growth of a SMBH and its influence on the cosmological environment.",

There are two prevailing models that describe the formation of the first black hole seeds: (i) from the remnants of the first stars - this channel produces light initial black hole seeds ranging in mass from 10 - 100 solar masses; (ii) from the direct collapse of pristine gas disks in the early universe - this channel produces massive initial seeds raning in mass from 10<sup>4-6</sup>&nbsp;solar masses. We developed a demographic model that traced the growth and mass accumulation history of black holes starting from seeds over cosmic time. Incorporating current observational constraints on dormant black hole populations (mass esitmates of supermassive black holes in local galaxies), and active black holes (from observed quasar luminosity functions) and other empirical properties. Our goal was to explore and predict observational signatures that might help discriminate between these two seeding scenarios. Repeated merging during the process of galaxy assembly tends to wipe out initial conditions, however, we found that early on in the universe, at about 700-800 million years after the Big Bang, there are interesting, unique signatures that can be used to distinguish between massive and light seeds. In particular, our research over the past 3 years has shown us that these populations lead to infra-red radiation (in the near, mid and far infra-red) radiaiton that is detectably by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST has two cameras NIRCAM (Near Infra-red Camera) and MIRI (Mid Infra-red Instrument) that should help settle matters. Our final state-of the art calculations suggest that the black holes originating from light seeds will not be detectable, whereas those derived from massive direct collapse black holes should be booming in JWST data.
