 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is an empirical investigation to explore the effectiveness of the Self-\r\nDetermination Theory (SDT) in the context of undergraduate engineering education. It is\r\nhypothesized that there is a disconnect between the principles outlined in SDT and the actual\r\nclassroom environment, thus creating a barrier to intrinsic motivation needed for student learning.\r\nAccordingly, the primary objectives will be to (i) assess the Faculty knowledge of SDT; (ii) develop\r\na measurement framework to assess the classroom environment as it relates to SDT; and (iii)\r\ndetermine the association among Faculty knowledge of SDT, student motivation, learning\r\nenvironment, and student learning.\r\n\r\nThe research design and measurement framework are developed through a meaningful collaboration\r\nbetween the researchers from Engineering, Psychology, and Education. This takes advantage of\r\ncurrent standards and techniques employed in the field of Social-Cognitive Psychology. The\r\nresearch questions answered through this project are valuable in developing reform strategies for\r\nengineering education, and can also serve as a future model for other STEM disciplines. The\r\nbroader objectives of the project support the NSF?s strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by\r\npreparing a better engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Also the NSF goal of\r\ninnovating for society is achieved by producing research-based results that may be useful in\r\ninforming educational policy and practices.",
