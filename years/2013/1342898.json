 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nWorking together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders.",

Important breadbaskets of the world, deltas play a central role in food and water security, and riverine and coastal vulnerability of urban and rural areas.

To better understanding the challenges faced by delta regions worldwide, the project &ldquo;<em>Catalyzing action towards sustainability of deltaic systems with an integrated modeling framework for risk assessment</em>&rdquo; brought together 23 research teams from 13 countries to develop a science-based integrative modeling framework that can be used to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management and policy decisions at the regional and local scales. The project focused on three deltas of global importance: the Amazon, the Mekong, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna. During the course of the project the research team developed a research framework that includes five main work-packages: a) developing an analytical framework for assessing delta vulnerability and scenarios of change (Delta-SRES), b) developing an open-access, science-based, integrative modeling framework for risk assessment and decision support (Delta-RADS), c) developing tools to support quantitative mapping of the biophysical and socioeconomic environment of deltas within shared data repositories (Deltas-DAT), d) developing Global Delta Vulnerability Indices (Delta-GDVI), that capture current and projected scenarios for major deltas around the world and e) collaborating with regional colleagues and stakeholders to put the science, modeling, and data into action (Delta-ACT).</p>\n<p>As part of this effort, the Indiana University team focused on studying the transformations of the Amazon delta and contributing lessons and analytical frameworks developed for the Amazon but applicable to other deltas.
