 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research activities of the Pacific Lattice Group, consisting of Professors James Hetrick, Kieran Holland, and Keisuke Juge at the University of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis project concerns computational field theory in particle physics.  There are four strands in this work, three involving theoretical study of strongly-interacting particles and one managing a scientific data archive gateway. The thrust of the first strand is to understand from basic principles how a few fundamental building blocks, the quarks and gluons of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), generate the experimentally observed hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and other exotic particles, as well their properties and interactions.  This work has significant relevance for nuclear physics.  The second and third branches of this research program explore models of physics \"Beyond the Standard Model\", in particular investigating the possibility that the newly discovered Higgs particle might be a composite of \"quark-like\" particles, or even a manifestation of extra dimensional physics. Finally, the fourth part of this research program is the maintenance of a large, public, internationally accessible repository of lattice gauge theory data, allowing researchers around the world to access and build on the work of others, thereby significantly leveraging the investment in this work and that of other similar researchers.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this work is to advance our current understanding of the fundamental constituents, structure, and interactions of matter and the universe.  The Standard Model of particle physics encapsulates the way that quarks and leptons interact, and explains all known accelerator data.  This Model is much like the Periodic Table in chemistry at the turn of the 18th century:  we have the table and its mathematical description of the interactions of its constituents, but we have no understanding of why the interactions take the form and structure that they do.  In chemistry, the deeper understanding of the Periodic Table came with the next level of physics --- quantum theory, explaining why atoms have the properties and interactions that they do. We are at a similar crossroads now in our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model, poised to break through to the next level of understanding of the structure of matter, and the results of this research project might potentially be one step in that direction.  On the other hand, the data archive management component of this project uses the latest high-performance grid technologies to make the results of this work and other researchers around the world available to each other, greatly multiplying the return on the scientific investment made by the public.",

However, as a quantum field theory, the Higgs sector of the Standard Model, involving interactions between scalar, fermion and gauge fields, is very likely a trivial field theory, it cannot be correct up to arbitrarily large energies (and corresponding short distances). This appears perturbatively with renormalized couplings which appear to diverge at some energy scale at any given order in perturbation theory (in contrast, QCD is valid up to any energy scale, due to asymptotic freedom). The non-perturbative understanding of triviality, using numerical latice simulations, shows that a finite energy cutoff is required to maintain a non-zero renormalized coupling. Increasing the cutoff to allow the theory be valid to higher energies forces the renormalized couplings to vanish logarithmically.</p>\n<p>Thus the Higgs sector is really an effective field theory, valid below some cutoff at some currently unknown energy scale. Above this scale it must be replaced by some more complete field theory from which the Standard Model emerges, such as the four-fermion weak nuclear interaction is a low energy manifestation of Electroweak gauge theory. This has driven the physics program looking for UV completions of the Standard Model, built on e.g. a new non-Abelian gauge symmetry from which the Higgs boson emerges as a composite state and the Higgs mechanism occurs dynamically due to strong gauge interactions. Because of the inherent and required non-perturbative nature, lattice simulations are a natural choice to explore such field theories. The discovery of the Higgs boson has made this a pressing issue, as no other clear indication of new physics at the LHC means many UV completions are possible.</p>\n<p>Our work, supercomputer exploration of theories and models of new physics, beyond the Standard Model, marries present-day computer technology to the latest theoretical methods, and can already test models of new physics and make predictions relevant for current experiments.</p>\n<p>Holland and collaborators have focused on two models that involve strong interactions, similar to the physics of neutrons and protons, as a possible explanation for the underlying behavior of the Higgs boson. These models, even if not realized in nature, provide benchmarks of how accurately strongly interacting theories can make predictions. One particular model, the sextet theory, has an array of particles created by more fundamental pieces being glued together by their strong mutual attraction. This predicts a particular sequence of new particles, which may have already been observed in the latest experiments at the LHC. The theoretical and experimental results will be crucially tested in the next year and beyond. Particle physics is a central piece of our understanding of nature and the universe, and research in strongly interacting theories is one of the next steps in pushing beyond our current knowledge.<br /><br />Similarly, Hetrick's work has explored exotic models of the Higgs field which involve extra dimensions. Theories of this type have emerged in the string theory approch to a unified field theory (which would unify quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity). In this, actually, old approach, the Higgs field would be the extra-dimensional part of the familiar gauge fields of the Standard Model, but the compactification of the extra dimension makes this component act as a scalar field in the 4-dimensional world in which we live.<br /><br />In both cases, our work has illuminated aspects of these models, answering questions about the models' viability, and raising questions for further research.<br /><br />In addition, the large scale lattice data archive that we maintain at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (http://qcd.nersc.gov) provides an important service to the particle physics community by allowing work of many researchers to be leveraged for significantly more results.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;Hetrick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318220/1318220_10274462_1512601153869_qcdnerscgov--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318220/1318220_10274462_1512601153869_qcdnerscgov--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"QCD.nersc.gov\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318220/1318220_10274462_1512601153869_qcdnerscgov--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"QCD.nersc.gov\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Landing page for \"the Gauge Connection\" lattice data archive at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).
