 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focusing on computerized manufacturing technology (CMT) and engineering applications designed to enrich technician education for students; to improve workforce outcomes in CMT-related industries, including aerospace; and to create educational pathways for technician training and pre-engineering students. Specific activities include: (1) achieving accreditation from the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) for the program; (2) providing professional development to lead faculty to ensure NIMS accreditation and a high-quality program; and (3) creating a flexible entry/exit system through a fully integrated CMT pathway for students with different educational and experiential backgrounds so they can achieve national certification in CMT-related areas. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is providing a sound model through which accreditation and intensive industry input can help resolve workforce shortages in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related technical and professional positions throughout the United States. It is addressing this at the local and state level through the strategic deployment of activities to streamline educational links with workforce outcomes. Of particular note are (1) the CMT pathway that is allowing students to individualize their education with distinct workforce outcomes that lead to jobs and (2) updated curricula to help ensure that what the college teaches is what employers need. The college has been actively involved in augmenting its CMT program over the past two years and is leveraging past work for short-term CMT training, building on new educational programs, and providing a programmatic and learning enrichment that is helping the state meet the demand for CMT careers in the future. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Because the project is advancing community college-level computerized manufacturing technology, computer numerical control, and pre-engineering programs, it has significance beyond local and statewide impact in the aerospace industry. Through its flexible pathway structure, the project is providing an innovative approach that allows the college to address educational and workforce needs of high school students, community college students, students returning to school, dislocated workers, and veterans. Accreditation is serving as a unifying force by assuring that all students are prepared for the increasingly demanding workplace CMT qualifications demanded by industry. Industry and other community partners are helping to broaden dissemination of CMT opportunities and ensuring that the program meets current industry expectations while faculty and others directly involved in the project are disseminating the effectiveness of the project through conferences and statewide meetings. The project represents a thoughtful, coordinated approach to benefit the entire State of Washington, including the Pacific/Mountain region, as the state works to rebuild its aerospace industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Pacific/Mountain Opportunities for Pathways to Computerized Manufacturing Technology project provided funding to:  (1) become a National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) credentialing site and provide training for up to 8 NIMS certificates; (2) provide NIMS professional development training to program faculty; and (3) create a flexible entry/exit system by developing a fully-integrated CMT career pathway for new and existing manufacturing students with different educational and experiential backgrounds so that they may successfully achieve NIMS certification.\n\n \n\nThe project was initially focused on attaining National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) accreditation and aligning curriculum to NIMS standards to strengthen the academic program and better prepare graduates for the workforce.  While starting the accreditation process and updating our curriculum, the college found an alternative to NIMS accreditation was to instead become a NIMS credentialing site and provide direct training for NIMS certifications.  The project was revised based on the feedback of industry and our advisory board and focused on offering NIMS certifications as a credentialing site.  SPSCC?s Advanced Manufacturing program integrated five (5) NIMS credentials directly into the curriculum and coursework.  The program has also developed the capacity to offer an additional three (3) NIMS credentials should local industry demand warrant it.  Each student entering the program has the opportunity to earn five (5) NIMS credentials through the completion of the program.  In the 2017-18 academic year, 34 students attained a combined total of 56 NIMS credentials.  Students attempted 59 NIMS credential exams and passed 56 NIMS credential exams for a pass rate of 94.9%.\n\n \n\nAdvanced Manufacturing faculty participated in several professional development activities as part of this project like the NIMS Instructor Credentialing workshop, online training on ToolingU, MasterCam, and Master Gage 3D, and a professional-technical Faculty Boot Camp training put on by the Center of Excellence for Careers in Education.  In addition, faculty visited with other 2-year colleges who are incorporating NIMS into their curriculum to discuss best practices and share suggestions for content integration.  The lead instructor attained eight (8) National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS) credentials as part of this professional development work.\n\n \n\nThe program developed more robust entry pathways into the Advanced Manufacturing program.  As part of the SPSCC?s campus-wide guided pathways initiative, the Advanced Manufacturing program created an educational pathway that provides students a concrete program of study resulting in a clear roadmap for completion.  The program actively worked with the local high schools to develop dual credit pathways into SPSCC?s Advanced Manufacturing program.  The college signed Career and Technical Education Dual Credit articulations (formerly known as Tech Prep) with seven (7) high schools for courses that provide college credit that can count towards the degree.  The program also focused attention on recruiting veteran students into the Advanced Manufacturing program.  The percentage of veteran students in the program has nearly doubled over the course of the project from 22% to 42%.\n\n \n\nA key outcome of the project was the development and launch of an Integrated Basic Education Skills and Training (I-BEST) pathway for first-year students.  I-BEST is a nationally recognized teaching model that allows students to increase literacy and work skills so that they can earn credentials, get living wage jobs and put their talents to work for employers.  I-BEST pairs two instructors in the classroom, one to teach professional and technical content and the other to teach reading, writing, math or English language.  This I-BEST provides an embedded overlap instructor who provides additional support with the math concepts and reading comprehension required for the field of manufacturing.  As part of this work, the I-BEST overlap instructor partnered with the college?s lead Advanced Manufacturing instructor to refine the curriculum and make it more accessible to students.  The Advanced Manufacturing I-BEST runs for two quarters (fall and winter quarters) of the first year.  This I-BEST provides support for the attainment of the first two National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS) credentials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Andreas"
