 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations of language acquisition are fundamentally concerned with how children acquire language given the input they receive. However, these studies often focus on the amount of input rather than the type of input. Recent studies have used artificial languages to study how children acquire inconsistent input. Pennsylvania State University doctoral student, Alison Eisel Hendricks, supervised by Drs. Carrie N. Jackson and Karen Miller, investigates current theories of language acquisition of Fering, an endangered language spoken in northern Germany. The dissertation compares the acquisition of consistent versus inconsistent input by children and young adult-learners of Fering. \r\n\r\nGrammatical gender is a system that categorizes nouns into genders, often resulting in different versions of the definite article \"the\". Fering speakers produce grammatical gender inconsistently, with speakers using both genders interchangeably. On the other hand, speakers largely agree on grammatical number. Half of Fering-speaking children acquire it as a native language, while half learn Fering in school. Thus, this project tests the influence of input type and amount of exposure on language acquisition.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation tests elementary and high school students' comprehension and production of grammatical gender, number, and general fluency. Parents will complete a language use questionnaire and Fering-speaking parents will complete the same experiments as their children. Adult community members will participate in free speech interviews to further measure community language input. \r\n\r\nThis project contributes equally to linguistic theory and minority language studies. By testing a natural language and tracking acquisition of inconsistent input over time, the project furthers general knowledge of child language acquisition. Using qualitative and experimental tasks betters our understanding of the task facing children learning minority languages. This dissertation investigates North Frisian, but the results inform other cases of minority language revitalization, and will interest teachers and language planners. The project also contributes to the training of a graduate student.",

The intellectual merit of this project comes from the generation of new knowledge about how children are influenced by different types and amounts of language input. This project tested the hypothesis that children produce language that is more systematic than their input when they are given inconsistent input, that is, variable input which is not linguistically or sociolinguistically constrained. We focused on the acquisition of grammatical gender in Fering, a dialect of North Frisian in which grammatical gender is produced inconsistently by adult native speakers. For example,&nbsp;about 60% of adult speakers use masculine gender for&nbsp;the noun&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em><em>skreep</em>&nbsp;&lsquo;purse&rsquo;, while others use common gender for the same word.&nbsp;While previous research had shown that children regularize inconsistent input in laboratory settings using artificial languages, this innovative project tested this hypothesis in a natural language setting. The results supported previous research showing that some children regularize inconsistent input&ndash; produce the same gender for all or all but one item&ndash; but deepened our understanding by showing that when children have access to a large quantity of inconsistent input, they are able to faithfully acquire adult-like lexical patterns.
