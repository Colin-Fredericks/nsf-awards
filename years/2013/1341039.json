 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is home to leading research centers in a number of areas, including astrophysics, genomics, earth and planetary science, and particle physics. Being aggressive adopters of computational components in their research programs, these centers all have current and growing requirements for high-performance networking. These research activities involve the transfer of big data across the network, and are currently limited by UCSC's connectivity to regional, national, and international research networks. The motivation for this project is to re-architect UCSC's research network so that it is optimized for these high performance scientific applications.\r\n\r\nTo better support these big data research activities UCSC adds a Science DMZ component to the UCSC network that is optimized for high-performance applications. The Science DMZ is a portion of the campus network that segregates these big science data flows from production network traffic. UCSC is provisioning 100 Gb/s external connectivity from the Science DMZ to regional, national, and international research networks, and 10 Gb/s to the computational infrastructure supporting these projects. UCSC is deploying enhanced measurement and monitoring capabilities to ensure optimal use of the new infrastructure, and the experimental OpenFlow technology to enable experiments in enhanced services for these users. To ensure researchers are able to make optimal use of the new services UCSC dedicates network engineering personnel to act as a bridge between the researchers and central campus IT staff to ensure researchers make maximal use of the new infrastructure.",

Prior to the the Science DMZ Prof Acman&rsquo;s data transfers (120GB/day) took 15 hours/day, leaving little room for anticipated 10x growth in these transfers. After initial work we were able to increase bandwidth by a factor of 15, providing room to grow for the near-to midterm research.

Before the Science DMZ the transfer of their data took 12 hours, leaving little time for processing and analysis, significantly handicapping their ability to provide input to the next day&rsquo;s experiments. After collaboration with the Science DMZ team, including consultation with ESnet&rsquo;s networking team, we were able to reduce their transfer time to 3 hours, giving them the breathing room needed to analyze the data in time to provide input to the next day&rsquo;s experiments.
