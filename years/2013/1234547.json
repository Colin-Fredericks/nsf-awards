 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research study is a follow-up to previous studies performed by the NCMS in 2009, 2006 and 2003 to assess the cross-sector commercialization trends in nanotechnology by US manufacturers. The proposed study series aims to track the continuing evolution and maturation of the US nanotechnology industry, develop profiles of entrepreneurial activity and industrial clustering in nanotechnology, and identify common and specific concerns across multiple industry sectors. The 2009 study was performed during a major economic recession, and analysis of 270 complete datasets obtained from industry executives indicated nearly 80 percent of the respondents' organizations were impacted. The results also indicated that significant consolidation was underway among many nanotechnology startups due to constriction of investment capital, while even large manufacturers and end-users had delayed or trimmed nanotechnology product development programs to weather the recession in the short-term. The 2012-13 study will examine how currently extant organizations are positioned to scale and integrate nanotechnology advances into innovative products.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work should provide important insights through analytics into the level of \"open-innovation\" and vertical integration in different nanotechnology product sectors, and how industrial requirements are driving the translation of nanotechnology research breakthroughs to the commercial sector. The significance and benefits of the study lie in industry-wide dissemination of the \"soft\" metrics and best practices in entrepreneurial and commercial activities in Nanomanufacturing. This information can be used for industry benchmarking and policy planning at the local, state and federal levels. The findings will identify critical resource needs and propose approaches that could lead to the improved competitiveness of manufacturers integrating nanotechnology advances, and thereby promote the accelerated receipt of the technological and economic benefits provided by that industry to US society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNanotechnology is a cross-disciplinary field of a variety of potentially disruptive technologies that involves the creation and application of novel materials, devices and systems by control and restructuring of matter at dimensions of roughly 1-100 nanometers in size.  Sustainable Nanotechnology Products (SNPs) are macro-scale products enabled by nanotechnology that are enginered to be safe, efficiently manufacturable and commercially viable over thier life cycle in achieving a specifice function or application.  SNPs can be best achieved by use of the life cycle thinking and anticpoating risks and negative consequences in the product design stages, while developing strategies and educating workforces for balancing the fiunctionality, safety and profit-potential enabled by innovative nanotechnology products and processes.  This is a pathway to realize triplke bottomline sustainability for convential products, addressing the unique concerns of the environment and stakeholders when scaling nanomanufacturing applications.\n\nNanotechnology-anabled products have already increased the sustainability of several industrial sectors such as semiconductor electronics, photonics, chemicals, and photovoltaics, and have the potential to positively impact an even wider range of industrial sectors.  For example. engineered nanomaterials could contribute to mare sustainable manufacturing through cleaner, scalable production processes that are less wasteful and can substitute conventional materials, thereby leading to savings in raw materials, energy and environmental costs.  Significant potertial lies in developing multi-functional nanomaterials and demonstrating superior or disruptive applications in the areas of energy and materials efficiency related to sesource savings and conservation of raw materials, which are key drivers for the application of nanotechnology in industry.  Green chemistry applied to nanoscale engineering can revolutionize that way we work and live, by employing less toxic materials and processes int he manufacture of nano-enabled products while protecting human health and the environment.  The 2014 NCMS-NSF Survery shows that nanotechnology with emphasis on sustainability is already helping American businesses create new markets, reduce costs, increase safety, and gain competitive edge.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Manish Mehta"
