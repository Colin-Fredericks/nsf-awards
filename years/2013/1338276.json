 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER project supports foundational research toward the exploration of data quality (DQ) issues in the context of sensor networks. Speci&#64257;cally, this project will include three major research thrusts: (1) a multidimensional DQ model for sensor feeds that can accommodate a\r\ndiverse set of DQ attributes. The project will carry out a comprehensive study into various DQ dimensions which will include inventing metrics and mechanisms for accurately quantifying the DQ dimensions; (2) The project will create a service oriented architectural framework for federated sensor service clouds in which DQ awareness is pervasive at all levels and all aspects of the architecture. Our core idea is to virtualize all sensors and auxiliary services in a DQ-aware manner; and (3) The project will devise DQ-aware autonomic techniques for sensor service discovery, feed composition and adaptation towards environmental dynamics. Our techniques will enhance scalability by detecting feed processing tasks that are shared among multiple user requests, as well as by cloud topology-aware distribution of feed processing tasks.",
