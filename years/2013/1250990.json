 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many research and commercial endeavors are experiencing dramatic transformations through the use of Big Data, wherein large data repositories are collected and analyzed to reveal trends, correlation, and information that may not be apparent in smaller samples. Current approaches assume centralizing the repository, which may be a poor fit in environments where the data generation rate exceeds the network capabilities. In this project, the PIs investigate system architectures for both real-time and historical analysis of geographically distributed data, combined with research in adaptively reducing data volumes to optimize bandwidth capabilities. This combination allows better use of the computation and storage associated with smarter end devices, including, but not limited to, distributed sensors, smart meters, and even full servers, without requiring network upgrades. Given the historical trends of the growth of computation and storage versus the capacity limits of wide-area networks, this research enables more data collection and analysis to be performed at a lower overall system cost.  Further, the ability to dynamically adapt data precision and fidelity to available network bandwidth allows systems to gracefully and automatically improve performance in the presence of higher-capacity networks. The research enables the collection and analysis of data that is currently left unanalyzed because of network constraints. Such data can include finer-granularity usage data, which could indicate actionable steps to reducing household energy consumption, or it could include a greater  olume of debugging and monitoring data, which could better predict system failures or provide greater insight than with current methods.",

These sources generate data at rates, sizes, and complexities never before seen, including from locations that may be spread all over the world. This has led to significant complexity and difficulty in processing this data in a timely or cost-effective manner.\n\nTo meet these needs, this multi-year research project focused on designing, building, and evaluating systems and algorithmic techniques that address key challenges in this new environment of exploding data volumes, including across the wide area.  At its core, this project explored how data processing systems can employ approximation as a first-class systems principle to achieve time-sensitive computational results.\n\nTwo major thrusts of research were performed, focusing distinctly on wide-area and datacenter data analytics.\n\nTo address wide-area data analytics, we developed the Jetstream system, a system that allows real-time analysis of large, widely-distributed changing data sets. Traditional approaches to distributed analytics require users to specify in advance which data is to be backhauled to a central location for analysis. This is a poor match for domains where available bandwidth is scarce and it is infeasible to collect all potentially useful data.

The system also includes adaptive filtering and other transformations that adjusts data quality to match available bandwidth (and thus ensure timely streaming of data under bandwidth constraints).  Through detailed evaluation of our prototype, we demonstrate that Jetstream's adaptive control mechanisms are responsive enough to keep end-to-end latency within a few seconds, even when available bandwidth fluctuates wildly.\n\nWe further addressed the timely processing of wide-area data in the VideoStorm system, focusing specifically on scheduling and managing machine vision algorithms on real-time video streams. VideoStorm's goal was to develop a video analytics system that scales to processing thousands of live video streams over large clusters. Given video analytics queries that perform vision signal processing on incoming video frames, VideoStorm contains a scheduler that efficiently generates resource-quality profile for a query for its different possible configurations, and then jointly maximizes the quality and minimizes the lag of streaming video queries.  This therefore allows the schedule to make tradeoffs between quality and latency (lag) between these video analytics applications based on their needs.  Developed in collaboration with Microsoft Research, the VideoStorm system was deployed in live trials in both Bellevue, WA and Cambridge, UK.\n\nTo address datacenter analytics, we explored system problems of adaptively controlling data accuracy, particularly in multi-tenant settings with many tenants seeking to use datacenter resources.  Much like VideoStorm explored for video analytics how quality or latency are not fixed constraints but rather tradeoffs, our research explored applying similar concepts to machine learning and SQL analytics.\n\nIn particular, SLAQ demonstrated a cluster-scheduling system for machine learning (ML) training jobs.
