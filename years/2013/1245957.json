 "awd_abstract_narration": "This novel project is developing robust links between multiple courses in biology to the general physics for biology majors' course. Aspects of this project include creating several large scale, open ended, project-based investigations that revisit physical and biological concepts multiple times in different courses. These investigations are integrating biology into physics courses and vice versa, enabling biology majors to see their curriculum as a unified whole. Furthermore, this project is providing measureable outcomes quantifying  (i) performance on standard disciplinary measures, (ii) attitudes toward required courses, (iii) understanding physics and biology in an integrated manner, and (iv) transfer of knowledge between courses and disciplines.  The project is implementing course reform that includes sustainability and dissemination.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal stems from a reform of pedagogy, which turns a collection of independent courses in different departments into a unified whole. This transformation is being accomplished in a novel way by explicitly developing expert skills over an extended period of time using real and engaging phenomena.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts resulting from this project include improved STEM training for women of African descent because Spelman College is an historically black women's college.  Further, this project is contributing to a paradigm shift in undergraduate education by weaving together strands of research in Learning Sciences and Physics Education Research. Plans are in place for dissemination of project outcomes via conferences and publications in both biology and physics education journals as well as in the broader education research community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project sought to develop and implement trans-disciplinary probject-based instruction for biology majors.  We created two projects that students start in their introductory biology course and continue the same project into their introductory physics course and on to an advanced biology course.  We developed two projects and started a third.  The two developed projects are 1) for students to develop a circuit model of a neuron and 2) for students to devlop a physical model of the circulatory system.  The third project is based on students devloping a solar cell to model photosynthesis.\n\nThe first two projects were incorporated into the introductory biology course three times.  A pre/post test showed that students still made gains on content knowledge that were statistically significant.  Knowledge integration questions given on the final exam showed that students were beginning to connect the two disciplines but needs more exposure after the introductory biology course.  This is an important findings because it showed that one course of interdisciplinary projects is not enough.\n\nThe first two projects were incorporated into the physics course twice over the course of the grant, although there was some initial offerings prior to the grant.  Knowgedge integrations questions on the final exam showed an improved understanding of the connection of the two disciplines in explaining biological phenomena.  The circulatory project was extended to a physiology course at the end of the granting period and the neuron will be extended to a neurobiology course this academic year.\n\nThe third project on a model of photosynthesis was offered once in the introductory physics laboratory.  The results showed that students gained on interdisciplinary knowledge and appreciation for the connection of physics and biology.  We will explore using this project across several courses in the future.\n\nThe overall findings showed that it is possible to offer trans-diciplinary projects that extend over several courses and still maintain the goals and objectives of the courses in terms of content knowledge.  In addition, the goals and objective of the courses can be expanded to include process skills, as well as life skills such as group work and communication skills.\n\nThe findings also show that it is possible to develop training for faculty so that biology faculty are able to offer projects with physics content and vise versa.  The training also inculded project-based and inquiry-based pedagogy, so that the Biology and Physics Departments have been impacted to move towards this pedagogical direction.  Another impact of this grant is that it has increased the collaboration of the faculty of both departments and has led to other projects, such as working together to incease quantitative biology content and modeling for biology majors.  The physics faculty is also planning on including a biophysics project, relating to modeling, in their computational physics course.\n\nThis grant has also impacted the use of our electronic portfolio system.  Students stored a reflection and summary of their projects on the electronic portfolio system at the end of introductory biology course, so that they could retrieve it when they begin their introductory physics course.  This allowed a better continuty of the projects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Derrick J Hylton"
