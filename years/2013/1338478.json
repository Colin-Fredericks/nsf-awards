 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs have found from preliminary data an increase in the potency of bacteriophages on the inclusion of Fe-doped apatite (commonly, Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl)2  ) nanoparticles. This EAGER proposal is aimed at exploring these findings to determine the validity and  mechanism for this unexpected response.  This work is potentially transformative in elucidating innovative ideas about the relation of nanomaterials to virus-bacteria interactions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research explores the possibility that engineered nanoparticles could be used to control the infection of bacteria by viruses (bacteriophages).  If nanomaterials can be designed to increase viral infection of bacteria, the materials could be used enhance antibiotics in therapeutic applications, or they might possibly cause ecological harm to natural bacteria in soils or water. \r\n\r\nTo further explore the preliminary results, the proposal will address three research questions: \r\n(1) What is the relationship between increased bacteriophage plaques and the NP?s size, shape,\r\nsurface charge, crystal structure, surface functional groups, and solubility? Is the effect\r\nseen with Fe-HA NPs simply a result of generating soluble iron-coordinated complex species?\r\n(2) Can NPs cause dispersion of phage agglomerates resulting in more infectious phage particles\r\nand more plaques?\r\n(3) Does this phenomenon extend to viruses of eukaryotes?\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work includes contributions to the training of undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students in multidisciplinary skills, including molecular and microbiology, chemistry,\r\nmaterials science and nanoscience. Montana Tech is well-positioned to address the training\r\nof a historic mining community that lags behind other regions in STEM based education. The\r\nproject will include women and students from tribal communities. The ?phage-digging? outreach\r\nassociated with this work has been in place for some time and conducted by Dr. Pedulla for\r\nhigh and middle school students for several years. The PIs will test many of the seventy phages\r\nnewly isolated via outreach programs with Fe-HA NPs to determine the breadth of this phenomenon\r\nand its potential impact on regional ecology. The PIs hope to extend this research into a NSF RUI\r\nfunded program and will continue to incorporate this research into educational components\r\nin existing graduate and undergraduate courses taught by the PIs.\r\nWe are highly inspired by such a cross-disciplinary investigation and believe that it may\r\npave the way to greater interaction between various groups across our campus, the state, and\r\neven other institutions nationwide",
