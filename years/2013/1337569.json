This research will build on six prior seasons of fieldwork in Tanzania and Zambia (together TZAM) to bring new data to bear on this major linked event of environmental, climatic, and biotic change. Our team will gather multidisciplinary data (sedimentological, geochemical, vertebrate paleontological, paleobotanical, and geochronological) during two proposed seasons of fieldwork. In the lab, we will use geographic distribution and community food web models to address more general questions about mass extinctions and their subsequent recoveries. For example, do mass extinctions consistently cause certain types of community restructuring or do their effects vary with environment and geography? Does the ecological rebuilding of terrestrial communities proceed in a stereotyped way, regardless of the exact identities of the species involved? Answering these types of questions is an important step in the process of moving from documenting the causes and effects of this extinction event, to using it as a source of predictive information for dealing with modern biotic crises.\r\nVertebrate paleontology fascinates the public. Because of their visibility, dissemination of our results to the general public will primarily occur at the natural history museums involved in the project. In collaboration with the exhibits departments at the Field Museum and Burke Museum, we will create two exhibit installations focusing on Asilisaurus kongwe, a small dinosaur relative from Tanzania that is an icon of our research project. At the conclusion of the grant, the installations will be permanently transferred to the National Museum of Tanzania (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), and the Livingstone Museum (Livingstone, Zambia) where they will introduce local citizens to the rich paleontological heritage of their nations. We will also develop a level of the FMNH's paleontology video game Game of Bones focusing on Asilisaurus. The game level will be centered around discovering and excavating a specimen of Asilisaurus, reconstructing its anatomy, and making inferences about its paleobiology. The game level will be promoted on the main websites of the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), University of Washington Burke Museum (UWBM), and the California Academy of Science (CAS), the museums' social media sites, and web pages targeting science enthusiasts (e.g., FMNH: Science@FMNH, The Field Revealed; UWBM: BurkeBlog; CAS: Science Today and Science in Action).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported field- and laboratory-based research about the end-Permian mass extinction and how it shaped the composition of subsequent terrestrial ecosystems during the early Mesozoic, including the rise of dinosaurs.  Most previous research on this extinction has been conducted in the Karoo Basin of South Africa, leading to a geographically-restricted understanding of its effects.  Our research targeted basins in Tanzania and Zambia, which were previously under-sampled and poorly understood, and has yielded a better regional understanding of the extinction and its ensuing recovery.  Our multidisciplinary team included paleontologists, stratigraphers, geochemists, and modelers working together to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, biogeographic patterns, and ecological community structure.\n\nOverall, this research was highly successful, with over 50 papers and abstracts published, over 2000 fossils collected, hundreds of meters of stratigraphic section measured, and numerous undergraduate and graduate students trained.  In particular, the fossils collected as part of this research have been utilized by over a dozen student researchers, including for two Ph.D. dissertations at the University of Washington (UW) thus far.  Three UW undergraduates contributed to publications and have now moved on to graduate programs in paleobiology.  Permian vertebrate fossils from Zambian are often spectacularly well-preserved and have allowed for unprecedented insights into the anatomy of early reptiles and mammal relatives.  Highlights include the oldest record of a dental tumor called a compound odontoma, the first middle Permian fossils collected from the mid-Zambezi Basin, and key findings about the early evolution of the mammalian dentition.  Tanzania?s Ruhuhu Basin has yielded unparalleled fossils of Middle Triassic dinosaur relatives documenting the early evolution of dinosaur-dominated Mesozoic ecosystems.  In total, at least 10 new species have been described as part of this work and a major finding has been that whereas Permian tetrapod assemblages were relatively homogenous across southern Pangea, by the Middle Triassic the same basins hosted markedly different faunal assemblages.  The latter implies that the end-Permian mass extinction afforded ecologically marginalized  lineages the ecospace to diversify and that biotic controls (i.e., evolutionary incumbency) were fundamentally reset.  The research undertaken as part of this project will have a lasting influence on our understanding of vertebrate evolution and the collections made will be invaluable additions to the natural heritage of Tanzania and Zambia.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christian A Sidor"
