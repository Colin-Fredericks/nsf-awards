 "awd_abstract_narration": "The attribution of modern planetary scale warming between forcings associated with solar output, greenhouse gases, and both natural (volcanic) and anthropogenic aerosols is a challenging and important problem. To date the cooling effect of large volcanic eruptions has been determined by measuring sulfate concentrations in ice cores. However, only volcanoes that inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere can cause sustained global cooling as the rain out of new aerosols in the troposphere is very efficient. We need a way to distinguish volcanoes with large amounts of sulfate in the ice core record, but no stratospheric impact (like the Mount St. Helens eruption), from those that reached the stratosphere, so that they can be taken out of the volcanic forcing function in climate attribution studies.\r\n\r\nFortunately, injection of SO2 into the stratosphere leaves a mass independent isotopic signal on the sulfur of the resulting sulfate aerosols. This research, led by a professor at the California Institute of Technology, builds on a new technique for measuring sulfur isotopes on small samples that lowers the detection limit the relevant isotopic systems by over three orders of magnitude. This new method will be used to generate a time series of sulfur isotope variability in ice cores of the top 100 volcanic events of the last 1,000 years. The researchers will identify which volcanic eruptions actually entered the stratosphere and therefore caused a global climate cooling. These are the events that must be accounted for in climate warming attribution studies. The research will focus on an ice core from South Greenland. Certain events will be cross-checked in ice cores from Antarctic to confirm the global distribution of sulfate aerosol. \r\n\r\nThe results of this work could be potentially transformative in changing our understanding of the sensitivity of climate to CO2 increases. Outcomes will inform educational outreach efforts. Funding also supports an early career scientist.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn principle we can use the temperature and CO2 records from the last millennia to understand the sensitivity of climate to future CO2 increases.  However, we must also understand how the sun\u00c6s output has varied and how volcanoes have (or have not) affected global climate during this time.  In this \u00e6attribution problem\u00c6 the CO2 sensitivity is solved by difference after the other effects on temperature are removed.  In the case of volcanoes, it is only those eruptions that reach the stratosphere that have an effect on mean global climate via the conversion of reduced sulfur to cloud forming SO4 aerosols.  This can only happen in the presence of a large uv flux, so that eruptions like Mt. St. Hellens that produced a lot of sulfur but did not reach the stratosphere should not be counted in the CO2 sensitivity problem.  However, the method for estimating volcanic forcing contains a well known flaw.  Typically non-seasalt sulfate concentration peaks are used to identify volcanoes and an algorithm that depends on their size and presence in both Greenland and Antarctic records, but this does not guarantee that the eruptions were stratospheric.  Fortunately the uv oxidation of sulfur also leaves a signal in the mass independent fractionation (MIF) of the sulfur isotopes.  Sulfate that has been processed through the stratosphere will have a 33S isotope signal that is different than the normal mass fractionation line.  These D33S values have been used for a  few eruptions to check whether the reduced sulfur output is likely to have had a global climate effect or not. \n\n \n\nRecently at Caltech we have developed a method to measure D33S on 1000x smaller samples than typically used by the field.  Using this new approach we have measured 8 different eruptions across two different ice cores.  We have documented MIF enrichments of over 3&permil; in an unknown event at 430 BC in Antarctica.  In addition, we are able to measure the background sulfur outside of the eruptions and demonstrate that it does not have D33S erichments.  Each of the 8 eruptions pass the test of showing MIF enrichments and two of them are from previously unknown eruptions.  The 157 new D33S points provide extremely high-resolution sampling of the time evolution of each eruption.  In several cases we are able to resolve the negative D33S compliment to the initially enriched sulfur isotope signal.  We have been able to observe the complete cycle of initial stratospheric injection to the final rain out of sulfate as the climate system recovers.  This unique data set will greatly enhance the coupling of data and models to estimate eruption sizes and possibly even the radiative forcing of each event itself.  We have sample 12 other eruptions from our collaborator Joe McConnell of the Dessert Research Institute and the work to characterize these is ongoing.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jess F Adkins"
