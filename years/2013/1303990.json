In particular, the conjecture predicts that for every rational function f over the rational numbers, the map on rational points is at most 16-to-1 over all but finitely many values. Using the classification of monodromy groups we settled this conjecture for indecomposable maps of sufficiently large degree. Our results have many other applications to arithmetic geometry and number theory including storger versions of Hilbert irreducibility type of theorems and characterizations of value sets of rational functions over finite fields.

In a joint work with Bary-Soroker and Moshe Jarden, we discover a surprising decomposition of the large parts of the absolute Galois group (its p-Sylow subgroups) into two well understood parts.
