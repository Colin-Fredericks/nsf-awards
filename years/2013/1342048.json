US Ignite fosters development of next-generation applications to provide transformative public benefit. The applications focus on six national priorities: Education & Workforce Development, Energy, Health, Public Safety, Transportation, and Advanced Manufacturing.  The inaugural US Ignite Application Summit will provide the first opportunity to bring together the community involved in US Ignite?s mission to share experiences, demonstrate successes, discuss barriers and difficulties, further engage industry and communities, and inspire students, academics, open source developers, and community leaders.\r\n\r\nA significant part of the Application Summit will be the demonstration of NSF-funded applications. The Application Summit participants will demonstrate that advanced networking technologies such as software-defined networking, virtualized networks, gigabit to the end-user, and GENI racks have real applications in the US Ignite target sectors.   The combination of technology demonstrations and other summit activities will:  enlarge the community that is knowledgeable about and can apply next-gen technologies to public benefit applications;  engage the non-academic community including industry labs, federal mission agencies, foundations, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, open source developers, and students at-large;  build a sense of community and common effort within US Ignite constituencies as they meet in role-based groups: cities, foundations, and testbeds, application developers, and technical coordination and tools; and obtain participant buy-in for the next year of US Ignite efforts to ensure resources are widely available and partnerships are coordinated to support development of more applications for public benefit.\r\n\r\n",
