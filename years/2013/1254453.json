 "awd_abstract_narration": "1254453\r\nNicholas, Jason D.\r\n\r\nFuels cells are electrochemical devices used to convert the energy stored within the chemical bonds of the fuel into electrical energy and/or heat. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), which have efficiencies of 60-85%, highest of the hydrocarbon-based electricity production technologies, achieve this by allowing oxygen ions to pass through an electronically insulating solid membrane; and in the process producing electricity by forcing the oxygen electrons to circumvent the membrane via an external circuit. By electrochemically oxidizing fuel in this manner instead of combusting it, SOFCs have demonstrated combined heat and power efficiencies more than twice those obtained in conventional fossil fuel-fed power plants. Unlike other types of fuel cells that can only run on hydrogen, SOFCs can operate on a variety of fuels such as hydrogen, biogas, gasoline, natural gas, jet fuel, and methane.\r\n\r\nWith their ability to run on both hydrocarbon and hydrogen fuels, why have SOFCs not become a primary energy conversion solution? Two of the most daunting obstacles to SOFC commercialization are 1) a lack of SOFC electrode catalyst materials with desirable surface properties at operating temperatures less than 600C, and 2) a lack of catalytically active, high conductivity, redox stable, coking resistant, sulfur tolerant, SOFC anode materials which will allow SOFCs to operate on dry, commercially-widespread hydrocarbon fuels. Professor Jason Nicholas of Michigan State University believes that the pool of available materials may already contain those which will do the job, including mixed ionic electronic-conducting lanthanum strontium chromium magnesium oxides. The National Science Foundation is awarding the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Award to Nicholas to systematically evaluate the hypothesis that the necessary surface properties and the catalytic activity and selectivity of these mixed ionic oxides can be enhanced through the application of an external biaxial stress. Although thin film catalysts will initially be studied, the PI intends to fabricate and elucidate the behavior of nanocomposite SOFC anodes containing strain engineered catalysts by a number of standard methods. In addition, the investigator will develop a novel curvature relaxation measurement technique which will allow oxygen surface exchange measurements to be performed in situ and in operando without the distortions caused by electrodes, yielding data not previously available.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will advance the field of catalysis by systematically elucidating, for the first time, the full relationship between stress, structure, electrochemical properties, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure in a SOFC anode electrocatalyst. The investigator plans a wide program of educational outreach activities as a feature of the CAREER award, extending to high school students, undergraduates and teachers. A specific activity will be to provide mid-Michigan Girl Scouts with an annual Michigan State University visit day aimed at introducing K-12 girls to the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines.",

In addition to producing valuable materials property measurements on several state-of-the-art oxygen ion exchange catalysts (such as lanthanum strontium ferrite, praseodymium doped ceria, and strontium iron ferrite), use of this technique showed that the precious metal current collectors or impurities commonly found in alternative measurement techniques (such as Electrical Conductivity Relaxation) can artificially boost the measured oxygen surface exchange coefficient (such that it no longer reflects the behavior of the oxygen exchange catalyst of interest). As part of this award, the impact of precursor solution dispersants and ceria pre-infiltration on the performance of infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathodes was evaluated; resulting in the production of some of the world's best-performing nano-composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell electrodes (the cathodes produced here had open circuit polarization resistances of 0.1 Ohm*cm at 550C). These nano-composite cathodes were provided to two Solid Oxide Fuel Cell manufacturers for evaluation. As part of this award, Density Functional Theory modeling of the electronic rearrangements that occur when oxygen vacancies are formed in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell oxygen exchange catalysts, and how those rearrangements impact the concentration, mobility, and conductivity of oxygen ions was conducted. This modeling work identified a new phase, cubic strontium ferrite, which (if it could be stabilized at Solid Oxide Fuel Cell operating temperatures through strain, doping, other means) is predicted to have an oxygen ion conductivity greater than the current state-of-the-art rhombohedral lanthanum strontium ferrite oxygen exchange catalysts used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathodes.

After 3 years of leading the event, in 2016 PI Nicholas handed this activity off to a new MSU Women in Engineering, Recruitment and K-12 Outreach Office that opened it to all 4-8<sup>th</sup> grade girls and rebranded it as an \"Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day\".

In summary, this award produced 14 high-impact, peer-reviewed publications, directly supported the work of two PhD students/two undergraduate students/one high school student, and helped set-up PI Nicholas for a career's worth of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell, ion transport, catalysis, and Materials Science discoveries.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/12/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jason&nbsp;D&nbsp;Nicholas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
