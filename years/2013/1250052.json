 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award provides Ph.D. students at the University of South Carolina at Columbia with the unique training and skill sets to advance the science and engineering of nanomaterials for sustainable energy generation. Trainees are collaborating in interdisciplinary research teams to receive a technical education in alternative energy production and to gain experience in technology commercialization, entrepreneurship and science communication.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Three main research areas direct trainees to design materials that can be applied to energy conversion involving: (1) transformation of carbon dioxide into liquid fuels; (2) conversion of biomass feedstock to liquid fuels; and (3) modifying solar energy into electricity. Trainees engage in problem--?]based learning and use case studies to address each research question through research and coursework. While exploring the basic underlying physical laws and engineering constraints for their research areas, students are participating and competing in a new campus innovation program.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project?fs emphasis on entrepreneurship and strong technical training is preparing trainees to take leadership roles within the fast growing renewable energy industries and existing fossil fuel infrastructure. The University of South Carolina at Columbia?fs campus programs and partnership with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in this project. Additionally, trainees are engaging in outreach activities with the South Carolina Governor?fs School for Science and Mathematics, to provide research opportunities and mentoring to STEM high school students. \r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF--?]wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.",
