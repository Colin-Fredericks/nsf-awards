 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis EAGER proposal is aimed at the development of an adjuvant intra-operative therapeutic method that will address several critical needs for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well as other cancer types to ensure clean surgical margins, prevent tumor recurrence, improve patients survival rates, and enhance their quality of life. This goal will be achieved through a novel plasmonic nanobubble (PNB) approach that combines intra-cellular application of four clinical modalities: encapsulated drugs (Doxil), gold nanoparticles (colloidal gold), near-infrared laser pulses of low energy, and X-rays. This method is referred to as quadrapeutics. The translation into clinical practice  will be achieved through the folowing objectives: 1) Optimization of the PNB generation and detection methods in vivo and validation of the use of PNBs for the intra-operative diagnosis of MRD in mice. 2) Adopt the PNB and quadrapeutic methods for intraoperative adjuvant therapy of microscopic residual disease in unresectable HNSCC tumors in a mice model.",

Failure of cancer surgery to intraoperatively detect and remove microscopic tumours causes lethal recurrence and metastases, whereas removal of important normal tissues causes excessive morbidity. \n\nWe developed intraoperative technology using our unique plasmonic nanobubble (PNB), a non-stationary laser pulse-activated nano-event, which intraoperatively detects and eliminates residual microtumours in the surgical bed.

The technology we developed, PNB nano-surgery can improve standard onco-surgery through: (1) Real-time intraoperative local detection of MRD in vivo with very high sensitivity and specificity; (2) Real-time guidance of surgery to precisely eliminate resectable MRD with minimal morbidity by resecting only PNB-positive volume instead of a larger volume; (3) Intraoperative selective elimination of unresectable MRD through the mechanical impact of lethal cancer cell-specific PNBs without damaging adjacent normal cells and tissues; (4) Prediction of the surgical outcome through the metrics of PNB signals. The developed technology is ready for clinical prototyping and trial.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dmitri Lapotko"
