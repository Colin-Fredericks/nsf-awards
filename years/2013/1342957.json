This will be the latest in a series of annual meetings held for CPS program grantees, at which they are able to present research results and collectively identify future research directions.\r\n\r\nCyber-physical systems use computations and communication deeply embedded in, and interacting with, physical processes to add new capabilities to physical systems. These cyber-physical systems range from the very small to the very large, and can increasingly be found in a wide variety of technologies we use in our daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this annual CPS PI meeting is to discuss the latest developments in the field and to help develop ideas for future research. The attendees of this workshop will hear general plenary talks by leaders in the field, then participate in breakout sessions to discuss more specialized aspects. The meeting will feature broad, diverse participation comprising the CPS PI community.",

Indeed most modern automobiles have several dozen such computers, making them really computer networks on wheels.  There many other kinds of such systems, of course.  Others that touch us personally are medical devices like X-ray and other imaging machines.  The electrical grid that supplies energy to our homes depends on networked control computers to keep our lights on. And there are many others.\n\nThis is a very fast moving field, because of the rapidly improving power of computer systems, and because of the increasing number of physical systems that can take advantage of them.  Thus it is a very active area of research and development, and the NSF CPS program provides vital funding to universities and research institutes to enable its progress.  The researchers who lead these projects are called PIs, and usually they are assisted by graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and technicians.  Once a year NSF organizes this CPS PI conference in the Washington area for these PIs to exchange results and ideas from their NSF-funded projects.\n\nThis project project was intended to organize this conference in 2013.
