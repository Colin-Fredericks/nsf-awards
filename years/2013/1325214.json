 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine isotopic and geochemical records preserved in the laminae of pedogenic carbonate coatings in soils in the Capitol Reef--Boulder Mountain region of the Colorado Plateau. First, the team will check for preservation of stratigraphic order in the laminae of coatings by microscopy, high-resolution X-ray mapping, and Th/U age dating. Coatings that preserve an intact stratigraphy will be micro-sampled for detailed Th/U age transects, stable isotope analysis, and trace element analysis. The team will compare well-dated profiles of stable isotope shifts from coatings collected at various depths below the soil-air interface to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of ecological and climatological changes that occurred over the measured time interval. This study will evaluate the problem of discontinuities in the pendant record which could be related to climate change on orbital time scales. Timing and mechanisms of carbonate formation will be evaluated with in situ soil moisture, respiration, and temperature measurements.\r\n\r\n Stable isotope analysis of modern and fossil pedogenic carbonate has advanced the understanding of continental paleoclimatology, as well as documenting worldwide ecological shifts. Most stable isotope studies of pedogenic carbonate have sampled soil carbonate at a fairly coarse resolution; only a few have studied the stable isotope record of soil carbonate coatings of the large clasts within a soil horizon. This work will test thick, well-laminated, pedogenic carbonate coatings for records of a meaningful paleoclimate signal in terms of their stable isotope record (13C/12C and 18O/16O) when coatings preserve an intact stratigraphy. If true, and there is some preliminary Th/U and stable isotope data that supports this, then the world's deserts may contain a vast and untapped quantitative archive of past continental climactic and ecological variability.\r\n\r\n This project is a collaborative effort between the University of Utah and Western  State Colorado University. It will enhance education opportunities for both a research institution and an undergraduate institution, and its results will be incorporated into an international course, taught each year at the University of Utah, using stable isotopes as tracers in anthropology, ecology, forensics, geology, hydrology, oceanography, and zoology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was to use the carbonates that form on the bottoms of boulders as a proxy record of climate and ecology in the late Pleistocene and Holocene.  We proposed that a near-continuous record could be obtained using micromill sampling and could be dated using 14C and U-series dating.  Based on the known age of emplacement of the deposits in which these boulders were found, we anticipated that we had the potential to recover a ca. 200,000  year record from these deposits.  This would give a unique record of climate and ecology for the Colorado Plateau region.  F\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit.\n\n   We included detailed monitoring of soil sites in the region and have been able to demonstrate that in this area, whose climate is influenced by the southwest monsoon, the predominant period of carbonate formation in soils is in the late summer to early fall season, which is when the monsoon is at its peak for this area.\n\n   Further we were very successful in 14C dating of these carbonates, and determined a near linear growth rate of ca. 2.5 mm per 1000 years, somewhat higher than we anticipated.  U-series dating was not as successful as originally hoped, due to low U-concentrations and also to suspected Th-mobility. \n\n   Over the past 30,000 years, we have identified two major ecological \"events\", one very near the \"8200-year\" event that has been recorded in marine sediments, and one at the Younger Dryas time interval.  Both of these are marked by a several permil change in d13C to more negative values.  Curiously, the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) is not marked by the lowest d13C values, suggesting that perhaps with the very low CO2 levels at LGM that photorespiration in C3 plants was enhanced such that C4 plants had a photosynthetic advantage.\n\n   Oxygen isotopes throughout this time interval (ca. 30 kyr to present) does not show large variations.   However, if we use the linear growth rates back to 100 kyr, we have identified a major shift in d18O in the soil carbonates at about 60 kyr.  This will be the subject of further investigation as we continue to work on the U-series dating problem.\n\n \n\nBroader impact.\n\n   This project demonstrates that soil carbonates can be used to get a continuous record of Holocene and late-Pleistocene climate and ecology.  This method will be applicable to arid- and semi-arid regions of the world.\n\n   This project provided important interdisciplinary training for a graduate study, who was trained in stable isotope geochemistry, geomorphology, computer modeling, and field methods.  The latter included mapping a 7.5 minute Quadrangle map for the Utah Geological Survey. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thure E Cerling"
