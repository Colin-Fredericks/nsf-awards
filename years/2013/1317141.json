 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award will provide travel support for early career U.S.  mathematicians  to participate in the XXII Nevanlinna Colloquium which will be held at the University of Helsinki, Finland,  August 5-9, 2013.  This mathematics research conference will focus on recent developments in geometric analysis, conformal geometry and dynamics, hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups, and Teichmuller theory. The conference will feature 12 plenary speakers from a diverse collection of fields, as well as 36 shorter talks.  For example: Ian Agol will discuss his recent resolution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture and Thurston's Virtual Fibering question; Jeremy Kahn will discuss the resolution of the Ehrenpreis Conjecture and the Surface Subgroup Conjecture; Maryam Mirzakhani will discuss her seminal  work on dynamics on Teichmuller spaces; Jani Onninnen will discuss his work in geometric  nonlinear analysis; and Marianna Csornyei will discuss recent advances in real analysis and geometric measure theory.  The conference web page can be found at https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/RNC2013/Home.\r\n\r\nThe Nevanlinna Colloquium will bring together a diverse collection of international researchers  in analysis, geometry, and topology. The Nevanlinna Colloquium has been, since its inception in 1964, one of the most important mathematics international  research conferences in the areas of conformal and geometric analysis, and more recently has expanded to a major international conference in analysis, geometry, and topology.  The plenary talks will feature leading experts presenting talks on recent major advances in their fields.  These presentations will expose early career mathematicians to cutting edge research in these fields.  The international nature of the conference, and the diversity of the subject matter, will encourage collaborations between researchers in different areas that will continue to drive the field forward. The principal investigators will especially encourage the participation of early career mathematicians who are members of groups under-represented in mathematics.",
