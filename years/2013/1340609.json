 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina State University is deploying a next generation extensible network architecture in support of faculty, staff and students across multiple disciplines, enabled by an NSF CC-NIE networking infrastructure enhancement grant.  This architecture introduces new equipment and processes at strategic points in the campus network, and provides a versatile infrastructure in support of e-Science, computing-in-X, and networking research.  It also leverages agile techniques like Software Defined Networking (SDN) to meet current and future needs of the campus community, while minimizing capex and opex.\r\n\r\nThe new architecture eliminates bottlenecks, significantly increasing access layer bandwidth in a few strategic locations, to support big data and advanced analytics.  This provides immediate benefit to researchers across diverse disciplines who are generating, processing and sharing more data than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe project leverages SDN techniques not only in support of networking research, but also for the construction of a dynamic \"Virtualized Science DMZ\" to provide enhanced network connectivity to the campus research community.  This provides an optimized, easily adopted path for researchers to exchange data on- and off-campus.  \r\n\r\nThis project starts North Carolina State University on a roadmap that allows the institution to extend these agile and high-bandwidth services progressively to a larger variety of campus researchers as data transfer needs grow and evolve.  In the future, by extending SDN capabilities in partnership with the North Carolina Research and Education Network, the institution will provide SDN capable bandwidth available to other regional universities and the Internet2 Advanced Layer 2 Research Network, ultimately improving the ability to conduct leading edge research.",

The new network has eliminated bandwidth bottlenecks that previously hindered the success of researchers across many different disciplines.  The award made it possible to replace 10/100 Mb/s ports in research facilities with 10/100/1000 Mb/s ports.  In addition, 10 Gb/s access layer ports were provided in critical locations for research use as needed. The circuits between upgraded research buildings and the campus backbone were also upgraded to 10 Gb/s.\nIn addition to enhancing bandwidth available to researchers, we were able to deploy a virtual science DMZ by leveraging software to virtually stitch circuits between research buildings across our existing MPLS backbone.  The virtual science DMZ concept delivered an extremely cost effective \"friction free\" path to researchers permitting the rapid exchange of data enhancing their ability to conduct research.  As a specific example, this topology permitted islands of SDN gear in different buildings to be connected to one another to permit researchers to conduct distributed experiments in software defined networking.\nThe grant also enabled us to connect our campus network to a regional SDN network currently being developed as part of a separate project with the North Carolina Research and Education Network (NCREN).  By providing a mechanism that permits our virtual science DMZ to connect to the regional SDN environment currently in development, researchers at NCSU will be able to exchange data with regional peers and will eventually be able to connect to other institutions that are part of the Internet2 Advanced Layer 2 Service (I2 AL2S).  By utilizing the functionality provided by the new network infrastructure,  we are in the process of establishing a BGP peering relationship between NCSU and the MCNC data center over the campus virtual science DMZ and the regional SDN network to permit the exchange of research data.\n\nThe award has provided enhanced connectivity to over 80 domain scientists (and their associated research assistants) across the College of Engineering, College of Sciences and College of Veterinary Medicine.
