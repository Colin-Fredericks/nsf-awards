The deployment of a large number of GPS scintillation receivers over a 2 km region will allow for the investigation of the temporal evolution of the 2D spatial distribution of observed amplitude and phase scintillations.  The 2D time-evolving observations of GPS scintillations will be combined with comprehensive theoretical-numerical 3D forward propagation of electro-magnetic waves through random media, and inverse diffraction tomography techniques to provide quantitative linkage between the observations and analysis of the ground array, and the underlying physics and structuring of the ionospheric irregularities causing the scintillation observations.  Furthermore, data assimilative techniques will be used to estimate large scale gradients in electron density, winds and fields, and compared with the scintillation results and auroral imaging to investigate to what degree knowledge of the large scale background ionosphere improves our understanding of smaller scale structuring.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOverview:\n\nThe purpose of this project was to set up six Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers less than 2 km apart from each other that would measure GPS signal amplitude and phase.  With the GPS measurements, we would detect scintillation, and compare the signals from each receiver to the other receivers to measure the charged particles? drift speed and direction. The goal was to test whether such an instrument could \"see\" the ionospheric irregularities that cause scintillation based on the effect they had on the radio signals passing through them.\n\nThe upper atmosphere from about 100-500 km contains positively charged ions and free electrons because ultraviolet light from the sun strips the electrons from some of the neutral particles.  This layer of charged particles is known as the ionosphere.  The ionosphere has areas of more charged particles and fewer, and these variations are called irregularities.  Irregularities happen at many different sizes and cause an effect called \"scintillation,\" or twinkling, of radio signals that pass through them.  This is similar to the twinkling of starlight at night because of the atmosphere.  Scintillation of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals happens when the signals travel from the satellites through irregularities about 100 m across down to users on the ground.  For GPS users scintillation can be a problem because if a satellite appears to go \"dark\" temporarily, the user?s receiver can?t use that satellite for positioning.  This can make a GPS position inaccurate or maybe even temporarily impossible.\n\nBecause they are electrically charged, the irregularities of the ionosphere are forced to move by Earth?s magnetic field, plus electric and magnetic fields created by the currents in the ionosphere and other regions of Earth?s near-space environment.  When the electric field and magnetic field are at right angles to each other, the charges move in a direction at right angles to both fields.  This motion is called \"E cross B drift\" (ExB drift).  At high latitudes, the ExB drift is horizontal.  With a collection of receivers, if the irregularities are traveling overhead past them, they will affect one receiver, then the next, then the next sequentially in the direction they travel.  This is the idea our experiment tested.\n\n\nKey outcomes:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project the receivers were set up in central Alaska, at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR).  The GPS receivers were placed a couple km or less away from each other.  They collected data from December 2013 through April 2017.  This work was a proof-of-concept that measurements from a closely-spaced array of GPS receivers can be used to measure charged particle drift motion when scintillation is happening. We also detected a difference in the sizes of the irregularities along two different directions, for example east-west vs north-south.  This dependence of irregularity size on direction is called \"anisotropy.\"\n\nWe built a detection method for identifying times when scintillation might be happening when surveying multiple days; a way to measure the drift and anisotropy using these receivers based on techniques previously used for VHF; and a way to estimate the quality of these measurements.  We compared these to a radar also located at PFRR measuring the ionosphere nearby, and the ionospheric speeds and directions were similar.\n\nThis project created a data set that is now shared publicly with the research community and wider world for those wanting to look at GPS signals that are affected by ionospheric irregularities.  At least one journal paper and multiple conference papers were written about this work.\nThis project supported one graduate student?s tuition and stipend during his Ph.D. program in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. This award enabled him to present his research findings at multiple national conferences as well as conduct his research, testing his methods, at a radar observatory in Jicamarca, Peru. \n\nThis award gave two undergraduate students the chance to build a  website and searchable database for providing this data to the public.   Both students have since enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Mechanical and  Aerospace Engineering.\n\nSome of the data created as a result of this award were used by two classes totaling about 40 students, in learning how to process and plot GPS data for studying scintillation and connecting it to space environment conditions more generally.  They each conducted a study to answer a science question, and provide evidence on which their conclusion was based.  Each student wrote their findings in a technical report, revising multiple times.\n\nThis project has supported a female tenure-track faculty member of a nationally accredited engineering program, enabling the junior faculty member to increase visibility of the work nationally and internationally. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seebany Datta-Barua"
