The thematic trimester will run from April 22, 2014 until July 11, 2014. The purpose of this thematic trimester is to provide a forum for the extended community of researchers and students in computer science and mathematics interested in proof assistants, and more generally, in the mathematics of formal proofs. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.",
