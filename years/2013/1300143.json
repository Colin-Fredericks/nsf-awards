 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to develop a low-cost silicon-based microsystem technology for real-time monitoring of concentration and size distribution of airborne micro/nano-particles as well as limited composition analysis on such. The envisioned outcome is a new microsystem technology for highly integrated particulate monitoring systems. Such microsystems can be the size of a pen or even smaller and are implemented by assembling a number of batch fabricated silicon components within a small package. The system can sample the surrounding air, separate airborne particles based on their size, measure the individual and/or cumulative mass of particles in each size range, and finally provide information on the water and organic content of the collected particulate matter in each size range. Particle size segregation is performed using micro-orifice cascade impactors while arrays of micro/nanoscale resonating mass balances perform the real time mass measurement.\r\n\r\nUpon successful development and commercialization, this technology could revolutionize the airborne particulate monitoring industry by enabling real time monitoring of nanoscale airborne particles down to a few nanometers size range using low cost, light weight instruments. Potential applications can be divided into three main categories: 1. Controlled environment/cleanroom monitoring for pharmaceutical and semiconductor industry; 2. Industrial hygiene and particulate exposure monitoring in mines, construction sites, and nanomaterial processing plants; 3. Environmental research and air pollution monitoring. For example, every worker in a cleanroom facility or high particulate processing plant could carry one of the envisioned monitoring instruments for better quality control or health hazard management. Monitoring of air pollution in large metropolitan areas is another area that could be highly impacted by this technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder this project highly miniaturized air-quality sensors capable of measuring particulate matter (PM) mass concentration were demonstrated.  Particulate matter are micro to nanoscale solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air.  Such particles are generated as a result of industrial processes, burning of fuels, and natural processes.  A clear link between certain health issues (e.g. lung and cardiovascular diseases) and PM concentration in the environment has been established.  PM levels are therefore one of the most important air quality indicators monitored in the US (by the EPA) and around the world.\n\nThe developed sensors consist of one or two silicon substrates (similar to electronic chips) with thickness up to ~1 millimeter and horizontal dimensions in the few millimeters range.  Micromachining processes are performed on the silicon chips to form nozzles, micro-chambers, and precision microscale mass balances.  When interfaced with a miniature pump, such sensors can sample air, collact the suspended micro to nanoscale particulate matter in the air sample, and deposit them onto the integrated mass balances within them.  The mass balances can then accurately measure the collected mass that will be proportional to PM mass concentration in the sampled air.  More advanced versions of such sensors also developed under this project use aerodynamics of suspended micro-nano particles to segregate the collected particles by their size and deposit particles within different size ranges on different mass balances.  This provides additional information about the size range of existing particles and therefore their level of toxicity and harmfulness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Siavash Pourkamali Anaraki"
