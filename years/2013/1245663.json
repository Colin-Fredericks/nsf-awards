 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AAWS) network, first commenced in 1978, is the most extensive ground meteorological network in the Antarctic, approaching its 30th year at several of its installations. Its prime focus as a long term observational record is to measure the near surface weather and climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS sites measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of 3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be measured. Observational data from the AWS are collected via the DCS Argos system aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. \r\n\r\nThe surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The surface observations from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite and remote sensing observations.",

This project focused on two goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve observations      of surface weather and climate of the Antarctic</li>\n<li>Study the      lowest portion of the atmospheric boundary layer over the Antarctic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our first goal has been a multi-faceted effort.&nbsp; Two new AWS sites have been installed in Ellsworth Land and Hollick-Kenyon Plateau, both in West Antarctica.&nbsp; These are the first routine observations in these regions and will contribute to capturing surface weather and aid understanding climate in that region. Several AWS sites have been removed that are no longer a part of any current research efforts, or no longer used by forecast operations. Additionally, the first climatology study of the Ross Ice Shelf was compiled using exclusively AWS observations.&nbsp; Findings from the study found statistically significant, albeit slight, warming at one AWS site on the western side of the ice shelf (an increase of +0.09+/-0.06&deg;C or +0.16+/-0.11&deg;F over 28 years) and one site that had one of the coldest potential temperature observations ever made (209.3K or -82.9&deg;F). Several other studies have utilized the AWS observations by those involved in the project as well as those outside the project.&nbsp; Some examples include verification of numerical model reanalysis, characterizing the annual state of the Antarctic climate, and study of extreme wind events in the Ross Island region. Short-term warming events have also been observed by a variety of AWS sites across the network.</p>\n<p>The second goal is the study of the atmospheric boundary layer.&nbsp; With the use of a 30-meter or 100-foot tall tower AWS with 6 levels of observing, this project has collected a unique observational dataset. This dataset has been used in comparison with numerical weather prediction models to determine areas of improvement as well as areas of model strength. It has also been used to study characteristics of&nbsp;the modern-day boundary layer climate and sensible and latent heat fluxes, contributing to further understanding the weather regimes in this area.</p>\n<p>For these observations to be of value for science investigations, quality control of the observations is conducted on an on-going basis. These data are then provided to the broader community for use in other research activities. Support of undergraduate students has been an important aspect of this project, with approximately 8 students working as part of the team over the life of the project. They have participated in basic activities with the data, all the way through involvement in the science research and publishing of results.</p>\n<p>Our scientific work has been both published in peer-reviewed journals as well as presented at regional, national and international scientific conferences and workshops.&nbsp; Educational outreach is an important aspect of this project.&nbsp; Several hundred students tour the University of Wisconsin-Madison, home of the AWS project, and dozens of classrooms have been visited over the life of the project.&nbsp; Outreach to the public has also included speaking to service organizations, having a display booth at local and regional events (e.g., Wisconsin State Fair, local severe weather seminars, etc.), and reaching out to the larger audience via our blog and social media presence. Also, a presentation has been given on this project and aired over the local public television station network across Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lazzara</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245663/1245663_10241044_1497387033194_2016_AWS_Sites_UW_05_13_2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245663/1245663_10241044_1497387033194_2016_AWS_Sites_UW_05_13_2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wisconsin Antarctic Automatic Weather Station Network\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245663/1245663_10241044_1497387033194_2016_AWS_Sites_UW_05_13_2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin Antarctic Automatic Weather Station Network\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A map that shows the locations the Wisconsin Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network as of May of 2016.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AMRC, SSEC, UW-Madison and Dr. Sam Batzli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lazzara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wisconsin Antarctic Automatic Weather Station Network</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245663/1245663_10241044_1497387273194_BAT_3dec2016_after--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245663/1245663_10241044_1497387273194_BAT_3dec2016_after--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Alexander Tall Tower!
