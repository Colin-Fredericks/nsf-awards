 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) \r\nIIP-1266013; Clemson University; William Ferrell \r\nIIP-1265999; Virginia Tech; Kimberly Ellis \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to renew the participation of Clemson University and Virginia Tech in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) for another five years (Phase II). The lead institution is the University of Arkansas (Phase III), and at present also includes the Oklahoma State University, the University of Missouri, Arizona State and the University of California, Berkeley. \r\n\r\nThe Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that works with its member organizations to address complex research problems in logistics and distribution. The mission of CELDi is to enable member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by developing meaningful, innovative, and implementable solutions that provide a significant return on investment. CELDi delivers on the I/UCRC promise of high-yield results by exploiting leveraging and synergy in multiple funding sources like individual member organizations, a pool of member organization fees, and competitive funding from the NSF to conduct both specific and generalized, basic research. In addition, CELDi provides the foundation and structure for educating the next generation of engineers in logistics and distribution systems. \r\n\r\nThere are two important broader impacts of CELDi. The first is that the Center has developed a model for applied research conducted within member facilities and focused on operational issues that produce academically relevant scholarship and successfully transfer results to assist the members in achieving logistics and distribution excellence. The second is the impact on students. The Center has created a number of mechanisms to develop student researcher skills including one-on-one mentoring sessions, group mentoring sessions, a best-poster contest judged by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), and ensuring more informal interactions occur between students and the IAB by pairing for lunch and roundtable discussions. The Center also intends to continue its efforts to increase the pool of talented students from under-represented groups by actively recruiting and engaging such students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that collaborates with member organizations to address complex research problems in logistics and distribution.  The mission of CELDi is to enable member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by developing meaningful, innovative, and implementable solutions that provide a significant return on investment.  The Virginia Tech site of CELDi received approval to advance to Phase II funding in March 2013.\n\nDuring Phase II, Virginia Tech collaborated with Air Liquide, Eastman, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and Dell to address distribution planning, scheduling, material flow, and service evaluation projects.  The projects conducted through the Virginia Tech site of CELDi have contributed positive outcomes for our industry partners and also contributed to the body of knowledge in logistics and distribution.  As part of CELDi, Virginia Tech also led an NSF Fundamental Research Project on \"The Physical Internet for a Sustainable Logistics Future - Advancing CELDi's Leadership Position,\" in collaboration with researchers at Berkeley, University of Arkansas, and Clemson.  Project highlights are described in the following paragraphs.   \n\nThe research team developed a new approach to increase the effectiveness of industrial gas distribution by providing improved strategic asset allocation decisions, while considering operational level distribution practices.  The results are applicable for organizations that are addressing strategic asset allocation decisions that are influenced by recurring operational processes and have distribution systems with central depots serving multiple customers with time varying demand.  \n\nIn another research project, the team improved the effectiveness of performance films manufacturing by evaluating different scheduling and roll matching approaches.  Specifically, the team developed new dispatching heuristics to improve due date performance for a complex job shop scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times, job re-entry, minimum wait time, and maximum wait time constraints. The team is also proposed alternative approaches for assigning film rolls to products.   \n\nFor the material flow project, the research team developed new approaches to optimize panelization and building plans so that construction efficiency is maintained or improved and ergonomic exposures are minimized.  The approach involved identifying common processes and building/operational rules, developing process maps and time estimates for construction tasks, and measuring associated physical demands through lab experiments.\n\nFor a computer technology company, a system dynamics simulation model was developed to analyze and predict market adoption of a unique service program.  The service program monitors computer system operations around the world and predicts potential failures in Dell devices.  The research team developed a decision support system to allow marketing and design teams to estimate the effects of different policies on market adoption of the service program. The computer technology company anticipates the enhancement of the service program as a result of of applying the decision support system.  \n\nFor a CELDi Center Designated Project, the research team identified potential applications of head-worn displays and related safety and health concerns in warehouse environments.   The team also assesses potential safety and health consequences of head-word displays and user-interface design alternatives for support order-picking activities.  \n\nThe opportunity to participate in industry-motivated research projects has significantly enhanced the careers of the faculty involved and provided valuable experiences for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  The research projects have contributed positive outcomes for our industry partners and also contributed to the body of knowledge in logistics and distribution.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly P Ellis"
