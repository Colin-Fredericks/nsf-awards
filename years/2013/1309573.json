 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to establish the fundamental underpinnings\r\nof low probability of detection (LPD) communication systems operating over\r\nclassical or quantum mechanical channels.  This provides a transformative\r\nimpact in two ways:  (1) establishing a new approach that transforms the\r\nlargely dormant (and socially compelling) area of LPD communications;\r\n(2) introducing and developing the foundations of the LPD optical channel,\r\nwhich requires quantum mechanical considerations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is based on a fundamental approach to the LPD\r\ncommunications problem that employs a broad array of tools to establish\r\na new branch in the large field of wireless communications security.\r\nThis project will also demonstrate the intellectual richness of the\r\nsecurity problem that arises when quantum mechanical considerations\r\nare considered in optical communications.  Tools from classical\r\ncommunications and networks, in particular information theory, mix\r\nwith tools from quantum information systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are focused on impacting society and education.\r\nThe hiding of the existence of transmissions while still communicating\r\nreliably has clear application in both military and civilian societal\r\ncontexts.  The results of this project will allow communicating parties\r\nand those whom attempt to detect them to understand the fundamental\r\nlimits on such communication and techniques to achieve those limits.\r\nFinally, the project includes an integrated program of educational\r\nengagement that utilizes the extensive resources of both UMass-Amherst\r\nand BBN, with the latter contributing both theoretical expertise\r\nand experimental facilities for quantum information processing\r\nthat will provide a unique opportunity for UMass students.",
