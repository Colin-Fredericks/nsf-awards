 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human activity profoundly transforms the natural landscape, with dramatic consequences for biological communities. Across the eastern United States many species are relegated to forest fragments embedded within cities and sprawling suburbs. These forests typically exhibit a striking lack of native plants (including tree seedlings), but have thriving populations of non-native plant species and dense populations of white-tailed deer. This project will examine how these phenomena are related, by investigating the joint effects of two important co-invading plant species and deer on the invasion process and the native plant community. The plants are garlic mustard and Japanese stilt-grass, two co-occurring species that pose serious threats to the native community. The study will address key questions concerning plant invasions in the suburban landscape: do invasive plants facilitate each other's invasions, and is invasiveness promoted by intensive deer impact on the native plant community, by their strong competition with natives, or by both acting together? The study will be a multi-year field experiment in 240 plots spread across six forests of central New Jersey. Half of the plots will be unfenced, and half will be fenced to exclude deer.  Experimental treatments will include addition of seeds of garlic mustard, stilt-grass, both species, or neither species added.  All invasive plants in the plots will be removed at the end of the study. The response of the plant community will be studied in each plot for five years, by measuring garlic mustard and stilt-grass population growth and changes in the herb layer plant community.\r\n\r\nMost people live in or near cities and towns, so this study of suburban forests will be of interest to many citizens, including the many conservation groups and local agencies that need to manage suburban forests to conserve native biodiversity. It also will enhance plant science and ecology education at a primarily undergraduate public college. Eighteen students will each engage in mentored research teams for two years and one summer, which will encourage them to pursue ecology and conservation-related graduate school and professions.",

These forests typically exhibit a striking lack of native plants, but have thriving populations of non-native plant species and dense populations of white-tailed deer. This project examined how these phenomena are related, by investigating the joint effects of two important co-invading plants and deer on the invasion process and the native plant community. The plants are garlic mustard (<em>Alliaria petiolata</em>) and Japanese stilt-grass (<em>Microstegium vimineum</em>), two co-occurring, herb layer species that pose serious threats to the native community. The research addressed key scientific questions about biological invasions and their effects in the suburban landscape. Do invasive plants influence each other?s invasions? Is their invasiveness promoted primarily by intensive deer influences on the native plant community, by their strong competition with natives, or by both factors acting together? How is the native plant community affected by plant invasions in combination with abundant deer?</p>\n<p>The study spanned six years and consisted of 224 16 m<sup>2</sup> plots in central New Jersey spread across six forests that vary in their ambient deer pressure. Half of the plots in each forest were unfenced and half were fenced to exclude deer. All of the forests harbored stilt-grass and garlic mustard, but not in the study sites. This allowed us to experimentally start new invasions and follow the invasion process and its effects on the plant community in a highly replicated, controlled manner. Each plot received either seeds of garlic mustard, stilt-grass, both, or neither (all invasives will be removed at the experiment?s end). We have studied the response of the plant community in each plot since 2013, by semi-annually measuring garlic mustard and stilt-grass population growth and changes in the herb layer plant community. Additionally, we collected a data on other environmental and deer-related variables, with the ongoing goal of creating statistical models to test system-wide hypotheses about how the suburban forest community functions.</p>\n<p>So far, invasion by the experimentally added invasive plants has been extremely variable, ranging from percent cover of 0% to 80% for stiltgrass, and very low establishment for garlic mustard. Stiltgrass has been far more successful in forests that are under higher deer pressure, suggesting that the conditions caused by deer (e.g. little competing native vegetation) facilitate its invasion, although its invasion has been similar in fenced and unfenced plots. In contrast, garlic mustard failed to grow into invasion-level stands regardless of deer pressure, and neither species has influenced each other?s invasion rate. We are still investigating a range of possible environmental drivers for variation in invasion success for both species.</p>\n<p>Due to its low recruitment, garlic mustard has had no effect on the resident plant community, but in the forests with substantial stiltgrass invasions there have been combined effects of stiltgrass and deer. Plant percent cover and the total number of species was lowest in plots that have been exposed to both deer herbivory and stiltgrass competition, while the greatest cover was in plots that were protected from deer and had no stiltgrass. The deer effect was similar, although weaker, in the forests under lower deer pressure. These effects occurred in both the native and non-native sectors of the plant community, with variation among individual species and generally much stronger responses by woody species. It was encouraging to observe recovery of important native tree and shrub species in the understories upon being protected from deer. These include sugar maple, red maple, sour gum, American beech, wild black cherry, tulip poplar, spicebush, and several <em>Viburnum</em> and oak species. However, other native species have not yet been aided by protection from deer, and several non-native, invasive species actually increased more in fenced plots; these were multiflora rose, burning bush, and Asiatic bittersweet. Our deer browse data support the notion that deer herbivory and its negative effects are not restricted to desirable native species. While some invasions like that of Japanese stiltgrass may be facilitated by overabundant deer, others may be suppressed. Managers of natural forests in suburban regions that face the dual threat of overabundant deer and multiple non-native plant invasions should be aware of possible unintended consequences of deer herd reduction that does not simultaneously address management of deer-preferred invasive plants. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research program has been conducted entirely with undergraduates at an undergraduate college. During the grant period, 28 students conducted research for course credit (and some also in the summer). Each developed a related side project for their senior capstone, and the majority presented their research at professional scientific conferences. This group included 20 women and 12 students from groups that are underrepresented in ecology. Of the graduates, five went to PhD programs, five work in conservation fields, and another seven either work in or attend school for science or healthcare professions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/20/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Janet&nbsp;A&nbsp;Morrison</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563638467528_miviinfence--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563638467528_miviinfence--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental Japanese stiltgrass invasion in fenced plot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563638467528_miviinfence--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental Japanese stiltgrass invasion in fenced plot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental Japanese stiltgrass invasion in a deer exclosure plot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Janet Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janet&nbsp;A&nbsp;Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Experimental Japanese stiltgrass invasion in fenced plot</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563639812623_IMG_0234--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563639812623_IMG_0234--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TCNJ students in the field\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563639812623_IMG_0234--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TCNJ students in the field\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">28 undergraduate students conducted field research during this project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Janet Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janet&nbsp;A&nbsp;Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TCNJ students in the field</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563640752065_MAESA2019groupphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563640752065_MAESA2019groupphoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TCNJ students at conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257833/1257833_10235421_1563640752065_MAESA2019groupphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TCNJ students at conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Most of the undergraduates from The College of New Jersey who worked on the project presented at meetings such as that of the Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the Ecological Society of America in April 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Janet Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janet&nbsp;A&nbsp;Morrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TCNJ students at conference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
