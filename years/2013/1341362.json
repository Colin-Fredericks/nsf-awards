 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kleptoplasty, the temporary acquisition and use of functional chloroplasts derived from algal prey, is viewed as an important model for the early evolution of the permanent, endosymbiotically-derived chloroplasts found in all permanently photosynthetic eukaryotes.  This project will study the evolutionary history and expression of plastid-targeted genes in an abundant Antarctic dinoflagellate that steals chloroplasts from an ecologically important alga, the haptophyte Phaeocystis.  Algae play an important role in the fixation and export of CO2 in the Southern Ocean, and this project will explore the genetic basis for the function of these chimeric cells with regard to their functional adaptation to extreme environments and will study the evolutionary history and expression of plastid-targeted genes in both the host and recipient. The project seeks to determine whether the kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate utilizes ancestral plastid proteins to regulate its stolen plastid, and how their transcription is related to environmental factors that are relevant to the Southern Ocean environment (temperature and light). To accomplish these goals, the project will utilize high throughput transcriptome analysis and RNA-sequencing experiments with the dinoflagellate and Phaeocystis.  \r\n\r\nThis work will help biologists understand the environmental success of this alternative nutritional strategy, and to assess the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on the organism. The project will also contribute to the maintenance of a culture collection of heterotrophic, phototrophic and mixotrophic Antarctic protists that are available to the scientific community, and it will support the mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow.  The work is being accomplished as an international collaboration between US and Canadian scientists, and in addition to publishing results in peer-reviewed journals, the investigators will incorporate aspects of this work into public outreach activities.  These include field data analysis opportunities for middle school students and science-based art projects with local schools and museums.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nKleptoplasty is the temporary acquisition of functional chloroplasts by a normally heterotrophic cell.  Previously, we identified a novel kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate that is very abundant in the Antarctic marine environment.  Unlike most other kleptoplastidic associations, it is stable for up to 5 months without reacquisition of new chloroplasts.  Algae play an important role in the fixation of CO2 in the Southern Ocean, and because of the abundance of this particular organism, we wanted to better understand how the dinoflagellate might control the kleptoplast.  We used high throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from cells under different conditions of temperature and light to identify the genes involved in kleptoplast regulation, as well as the evolutionary history of those genes.  We determined that the dinoflagellate hosts a non-photosynthetic peridinin plastid in addition to the kleptoplast, and that it expresses and targets plastid related genes to both organelles.  While transcripts related to cell metabolism, DNA replication and growth show differential expression under different environmental conditions, the plastid-associated transcripts do not.  We also discovered that the kleptoplast showed a substantial decrease in photosystem II activity, suggesting reliance on photosystem I.  This was supported by our observation of dinoflagellate expressed nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted photosystem I associated transcripts.  We propose that the reduction in oxidative damage by decreasing PSII activity, along with the support of PSI by the dinoflagellate, may help to prolong the life of the kleptoplasts. \n\nBroad impacts\n\nIn addition to publishing papers and presenting at meetings, I have participated in several outreach activities. I collaborated with a graphic arts teacher at Falmouth High School to incorporate Antarctic science images into their artwork.  In the classroom I gave a short presentation on Antarctica and what research I have been doing regarding microbes in general, followed by questions from the students.  The students were then allowed to choose images of plankton for a watercolor project and images of Antarctic scenery for a linoleum cut printing project.  The students were not only to learn techniques, but to reflect the scientific work and incorporate characteristics of the polar region such as the dramatic lighting and frozen environment.  Completed art was exhibited at the Falmouth High School Science Fair in February 2016, and as an exhibit in the WHOI Exhibit Center in May 2016. \n\nI also talked to several third grade classes about Antarctica during their study of penguins.  In addition to lots of penguin images, I showed pictures of how scientists travel to Antarctica and how research is conducted onboard the RVIB NB Palmer. \n\nMost recently, I interacted with local Girl Scout Troops in their pursuit of Oceanography Badges. I gave a 20 minute 'Introduction to Oceanography' presentation that described the different fields studied by oceanographers and briefly introduces the first oceanographic expeditions.
