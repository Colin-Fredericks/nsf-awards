 "awd_abstract_narration": "PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: \r\nUniversity of Alabama in Huntsville\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION \r\nUltraWideband (UWB) is a radio technology that operates at a very low energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications using a large portion of the radio spectrum. The technology offers a solution to the future connectivity needs of the next -generation consumer electronic devices that cannot be met with today's wireless LAN and WPAN technologies. The attributes of high bandwidth, high fidelity, low power, low cost, and compact physical size which make UWB ideal for enabling wireless connectivity is also ideal for a hands-on instrumentation platform for learning the basic concepts in signals and signal processing for an electrical engineer. \r\n\r\nThis project is enhancing undergraduate education in electrical engineering by incorporating recent advances in high performance UWB instrumentation into laboratories to improve student learning. This approach allows key fundamental concepts in signal and signal processing (e.g., the impulse response, modulation, time-domain/frequency-domain duality, sampling, signal orthogonality, correlations, and filtering) to emerge from mathematical theory using the UWB technology and materialize in hands-on experiments.\r\n\r\nThe project is addressing the need to provide students unique hands-on practice with real-world technology to connect the dots between signal and signal processing concepts and system performance. Students crave these practical exercises so they can see the \"big picture\" and understand why learning these concepts is important. This laboratory fills a void in the curriculum that has been long overlooked. \r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE \r\nThe project holds promise to bridge the gap between theoretical signal processing concepts and wireless operations via experiences in a practical laboratory environment. As future employee or graduate researchers, the students can immediately engage in the design process, an often-rare commodity. External feedback provided by industry is facilitating a line of communication, which is creating a better alignment of course content with current technology trends. Finally, the targeted materials developed during the project increase the likelihood of curriculum adoption by other institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to improve the student learning of electrical and computer engineering undergraduates in the area of signals and signal processing.  This goal was accomplished by introducing an Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio frequency platform, called the Time Domain P410, into the junior-level signal processing laboratory. The platform provides real signals and real applications for the students to explore.  This project has developed laboratory exercises concentrating on various aspects of signal processing while introducing radar concepts.  These experiments have been developed with consultation from engineers working in the radar/communication/signal processing community.  The experiments and additional material for the instructor are available for adoption at other institutions.\n\n The laboratory experiments are briefly described as:\n\nIntroduction to the P410 and Radar: This experiment introduces the Time Domain PulsON 410 ultra-wideband (UWB) hardware and software.  Students obtain radar scans and learn how determine the location of an object based on those scans.\nIntroduction to Clutter: Since the radar units are being deployed in an indoor laboratory environment, the transmitted signals reflect off of many objects producing clutter in the scans, which makes it difficult to detect the intended target.  This experiment introduces students to clutter and methods to mitigate the effects of clutter.\nRadar Range Equation: In this experiment the students explore the radar range equation by making measurements on various targets and at different distances.  They process the received scans and calculate the signal power to ensure that it follows the radar range equation.\nCoherent Integration: This experiment explores the effects of coherent integration.  The students determine the relationship between the number of transmitted pulses and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  They then verify this relationship by calculating the SNR for various pulse integration indices.\nAntenna Pattern: The purpose of this experiment is to show the students the effects of an antenna pattern on received signal strength.  The students calculate the signal strength of returns when the target is in various positions relative to the antenna.\nSignal Spectrum and Filtering: In this experiment the students calculate and plot the magnitude spectrum of a radar scan. From the spectrum the students observe the signal has the frequency content described in the device specifications.  The students also design low pass and high pass filters, and observe the effects of the filters on their signals in both the time and frequency domains.\nMatched Filter and Correlation: The students learn that the optimum processing of a received signal to maximize SNR is by use of a matched filter.  They estimate the matched filter from a clean received signal.  The matched filter is used to filter a signal that has several targets.  In addition, the students use their matched filter to perform correlation to show the equivalence of the operations.\nDoppler Processing: This experiment analyzes the Doppler return from a swinging pendulum.  The students analyze the resulting signals in both the time and frequency domain, and thus can observe both the change in position and the change in velocity of the target.\n\n\n The students that have participated in these laboratories have shown an improvement in their understanding of signals and signal processing concepts.  In addition, we have found that interest in elective courses in the general signals area (communications, signal processing and controls) has increased since implementing this laboratory. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laurie L Joiner"
