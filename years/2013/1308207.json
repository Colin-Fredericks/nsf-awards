 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigating the role of genetics, spatial landscaping, and social networks on insect migration\r\n\r\nThe recent resurgence of bed bugs has fostered renewed scientific interest in these long-forgotten pests. Bed bug infestations are on a steady increase nationwide. However, too little is known about the behavior, biology, and migration and dispersal patterns of the common bed bug to allow much to be done to combat these pests. Lack of knowledge of bed bug migration leads to rapid outbreaks and heavy infestations. Therefore, bed bug populations provide an excellent opportunity to study the migration patterns of arthropods in an urban setting. This research will develop an interdisciplinary study, integrating methods from the social sciences, spatial statistics, and landscape genetics to study how bed bug populations move through an urban environment. Specifically, the dispersal patterns will be analyzed by the combined use of microsatellite markers and social network analysis. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research project will inform the scientific community. Participation, particularly that of college students from underrepresented backgrounds, will be increased in the biological sciences, through the teaching component of the award.  Knowledge about important biological problems will be imparted. The award will also provide educational programs on the basic behavior and biology of bed bugs, and proper maintenance and/or eradication of bed bug infestations for underserved and marginalized members of the Raleigh and Greensboro, North Carolina communities. In particular, residents of the Raleigh Housing Authority will benefit from bed bug education programming developed by the investigator.",
