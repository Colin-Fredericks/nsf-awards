 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER Abstract:\r\nLow Temperature Microplasmas For Thermal Energy Conversion, Education, and Outreach\r\n\r\nThermionic energy conversion (TEC) is the direct conversion of heat to electricity by the thermal\r\n(thermionic) emission of electrons from a very hot surface. Though historically pursued primarily\r\nfor electricity production from nuclear sources in space applications, it has the potential to be used\r\nterrestrially for waste heat, solar, or nuclear energy conversion. To meet this objective, however,\r\nTEC must be enhanced to operate more efficiently at lower temperatures than historically possible.\r\nMicroplasma thermionic energy conversion occurs when a microplasma (ionized gas) is ignited\r\nbetween a thermionic diode with an electrode spacing ~1-20 micrometers. This mode of operation\r\ncould enable operation in inert gases, at near atmospheric pressures, and at lower temperatures - all\r\nnecessary features for practical terrestrial application. Understanding of the fundamental interaction\r\nbetween thermionic emission and microplasmas will be advanced by this research in order to pave\r\nthe way for microplasma-TEC devices. First principles theory and simulations will be used to reveal\r\nthe inter-dependence between a microplasma and thermionic emission, and experiments will be\r\nconducted to confirm the enhancement of thermionic emission by a microplasma necessary to realize\r\nimproved energy conversion efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes, including diamond and carbon\r\nnanotubes, will be synthesized using a microplasma jet processing technique and used as electrodes\r\nin microplasma-TEC experiments. In addition to the efficacy of microplasma-TEC being established\r\nby this research, fundamental studies will also advance the basic understanding of plasma/electrode\r\ncoupling, where there are persistent questions that affect a wide variety of technologies from highintensity\r\ndischarge lamps to arc-based materials deposition.\r\n\r\nDirect thermal-to-electrical energy conversion can be used to convert solar, nuclear, and waste heat\r\nto electricity, and energy conversion technologies will play an important role in creating a more\r\nenergy efficient and independent nation. The discoveries made by this research will lay the\r\nfoundation for practical, terrestrial TEC devices that could become an essential part of the energy\r\neconomy, greatly impacting energy security in the United States. Further, undergraduate students\r\nfrom underrepresented minorities will be engaged in this research early in their careers, creating a\r\nmore effective undergraduate research experience and increasing the number that achieve graduate\r\nscience and engineering degrees. Using a service-learning approach, outreach to the local K-8 youth\r\nin the community will be led by these undergraduates including the creation of a plasma exhibit for a\r\ncommunity-wide science festival and a targeted, interactive outreach program on environmental\r\nscience for middle school students. These undergraduate students will be exposed to the fulfilling\r\nnature of outreach and also inspire a large number of K-8 youth toward science and engineering,\r\ncreating a perpetuating educational cycle in which each generation fosters the inspiration,\r\nexcitement, and development of the next generation.",
