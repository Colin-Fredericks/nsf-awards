 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysis of the recently-acquired multi-channel seismic (MCS) data will address a series of topics that relate to the structure of the lithosphere and the margin evolution along the central WA portion of Cascadia subduction zone, and how these relate to current seismicity patterns. Advanced processing of the MCS data is expected to identify the depth and character of the plate boundary and the amount of sediment currently being subducted will be assessed. Deformation of strata within the accretionary wedge will be mapped to track longer-term evolution of the plate interactions. Estimates of crustal hydration will be obtained from assumed seismic velocity-porosity relationships and, along interfaces, reflectivity. Maps showing the distribution of methane hydrates in the region will be produced.\r\n\r\nResults will provide a framework within which other Cascadia geoscientific studies are conducted, both for seismic processes and tectonic evolution, and are likely to have implications for hazard assessment. While this subduction zone currently has less earthquake activity than other zones around the world, onshore evidence of repeated megathrust events is clear, so it is important to understand the history of of stress buildup (strata deformation) and the extent to which fluids along faults might enable periods of 'lubricated', slow release.",
