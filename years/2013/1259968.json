 "awd_abstract_narration": "Binghamton University, State University of New York, is increasing the number of diverse, economically disadvantaged students pursuing careers in science and engineering disciplines. This program recruits economically disadvantaged students graduating from community colleges and prepares them for STEM careers with activities focused on nanofabrication technology. The goal is to increase the number of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Recruiting activities include partnerships with regional community college and high school counselors and recruiting visits to community colleges and high schools. Scholarships are provided for 32 transfer students in their junior or senior years at Binghamton University. The program provides support for students through activities focused on skill development in the Binghamton University nanofabrication facility, the development of peer support networks, and mentoring.  The program includes opportunities for 'learning by teaching' and 'learning by research' and investigates a new approach to improve student performance and interest. The program is testing a model for encouraging community college students to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering disciplines. In addition, through outreach efforts and campus summer camps, this program engages younger students and high-school students in the exciting field of nanotechnology.",
