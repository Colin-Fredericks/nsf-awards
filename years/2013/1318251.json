 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Science Foundation funds will support Dr. Wesley D. Stoner in analyses that will improve methods of pottery sourcing and chemical characterization using a well-known case study in the Basin of Mexico.  Through chemical and mineral analyses, archaeologists can trace ceramics used and discarded during the human past back to the source of production.  Connecting consumers and producers essentially reconstructs economic exchange, which normally remains invisible in the archaeological record.  The exchange of goods among human groups has provided data to better understand the foundations ancient civilizations, the accumulation of power into the hands of the few, and the collapse of some of the most powerful states and empires to have ever graced this earth.  The Basin of Mexico is no exception, trade reconstructions there have contributed to knowledge of Mexico's very first exchange systems and the flows of trade and tribute commanded by the Aztec Empire.  In the past, most of these analyses have been undertaken through neutron activation analysis (NAA).  \r\n\r\nWhile NAA is among the most commonly applied ceramic compositional techniques, it is not always the best tool to answer all research questions.  Recent ceramic studies using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) have demonstrated that targeted analysis of components within the ceramic paste can augment, and sometimes supersede, the utility of bulk NAA data.  The principal purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether data for specific components of the paste (i.e. temper choice, mixing of temper and clays, natural aplastic inclusions) can potentially surpass the provenance capabilities of bulk chemical data garnered from NAA.  I will employ LA-ICP-MS to collect data on both clay and aplastic (temper and natural inclusions) fractions within tempered ceramics from the Basin of Mexico.  Petrography, undertaken through image analysis with a digital microscope, will serve as a tool to interpret the chemical data in this study.  \r\n\r\nArchaeologists have not commonly used LA-ICP-MS to study ceramic pastes, so method development is still largely in an experimental phase.  Image analysis of petrographic thinsection photographs is also a relatively recent technological advancement for use in characterizing archaeological ceramics.  The combination of these two techniques provides detailed information on individual components of the paste so that behavioral stages of pottery production - from raw material procurement and mixing of pastes to decoration with slips and paints - become visible to the analyst.  The proposed research promises to identify methods for more efficient and detailed provenance analysis. \r\n\r\nThis research will produce standard protocol manuals to guide LA-ICP-MS and petrographic studies at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR).  These manuals will be reduced for broad dissemination through international journal publications and perhaps a book manuscript.  This project will also serve as the basis to train students and staff at the University of Missouri in both LA-ICP-MS and petrographic methods.  Additionally, a Mexican student will travel to MURR to assist in all data collection.  Through this student, knowledge of the techniques will spread internationally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major focus of archaeological study is the reconstruction of human interaction networks of the past.  From the simplest mobile hunter-gatherers to the development of large cities and states, the degree to which humans interacted with one another politically, economically, and socially steadily increased.  Economic exchanges would remain invisible to our reconstructions of the past if not for a category of archaeological studies referred to as \"compositional sourcing\".  Sourcing developed in the discipline of geology to trace a rock or mineral back to the parent material where it originally fragmented off and was carried away by natural processes.  Archaeologists use the same principal to trace materials and goods in the archaeological record back to the material source or the source of production. \n\nA variety of chemical and mineral characterization techniques have been used in this quest to reconstruct past human interaction systems.  Among the most common is neutron activation analysis (NAA).  For NAA, the archaeologist grinds a fragment of an artifact into a powder and irradiates the sample in a nuclear reactor.  Based on the energy signatures detected from the decay of the irradiated sample, archaeologists are able to reliably determine with precision the chemical composition of the sample for at least 33 elements.  This technique has been used to create large databases that are critical for sourcing to work.  However, NAA treats composite materials as a 'black box' and the chemical contributions of each component cannot be differentiated.  Pottery, which was often traded over long distances in the human past, is such a composite material that consists of clays, fragments of rocks and minerals, water (until firing), and slips and pigments covering the surface.  Another technique called inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) can be coupled with a laser to analyze each of these different components in isolation.  The ability to isolate components of pottery allows the archaeologist to better understand the recipe used to produce pottery, which in turn provides greater resolution in their ability to understand the behaviors of resource procurement, pottery production, and exchange.  \n\nIn some cases, it has been determined that certain components of the pot provide more significant data for identifying the source of pottery production.  If the clay fraction of the pottery comes from distinct chemical sources, it is possible that other components of the pot, such as temper, can interfere with source determinations.  It is advantageous in some cases to employ LA-ICP-MS to isolate certain components of the pottery, which can enhance source determinations.\n\nThe test case in this study was the prehispanic Basin of Mexico, a region that has an extensive NAA database for ancient pottery.  It is an interior drainage basin where sediments used for making pottery mix at the center of the region.  Because of this, chemical sourcing has been very difficult, though it remains an important pursuit.  This region was home to the centers to some of the world's only pristine states (states that arise independently due to internal processes as opposed to influence from the outside).  The \"Aztec Empire\" is one such state that captures the mind of the public.  \n\nThis project sampled over 500 fragments of pottery for targeted analysis of the clay fraction using LA-ICP-MS that had previously been analyzed by NAA.  It was to be determined if the clay fraction of pottery was potentially better for sourcing pottery than the bulk NAA data.  In the end, it was determined that LA-ICP-MS could independently reproduce source assignments for pottery that had previously been determined via NAA, but it did not exceed the capabilities of NAA.  However, the chemical relationship between the two techniques was established and a new multitechnique approach is proposed to initially screen samples in a study region to identify the best methodology ..."
