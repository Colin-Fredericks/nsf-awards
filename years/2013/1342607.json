The list of speakers includes top mathematicians such as G. Iyer, A. Kiselev, N. Masmoudi and E. Titi. The audience will consist of the participants from various universities and institutions in Louisiana and the New Orleans area, as well as other parts of the United States and abroad, such as, Loyola University, Xavier University, University of New Orleans, Louisiana State University, University of Louisiana, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia. The organizers anticipate the participation of minority scholars. This is a high impact conference for the region of Louisiana.",
