This project is developing a survey-style instrument that can measure key processes related to student innovation, subsequently termed ?innovative engagement.? The project is 1) developing a testable theoretical model of innovative engagement specific to engineering education, 2) developing an instrument to measure innovative engagement in engineering classrooms, and 3) disseminating the instrument to engineering educators in the form of a technical manual.  The instrument is being aligned with ABET student outcomes orientated toward problem solving and is meant for accreditation assessment and engineering education research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcome Report\n\nThe overarching purpose of this project was to broaden and strengthen a theory of engineering student engagement by defining forms of student interaction that are predictive of innovation in engineering classrooms, and providing evidence that these forms of engagement can be measured with a high degree of confidence. The goal of the project was to develop an assessment instrument for measuring student engagement that targets a systems-level of analysis, or interaction among students rather than individual actions.  The assessment is intended for use in classroom based engineering education research.  The instrument was designed to assess 1) post-secondary engineering students? perceptions of interactive engagement, 2) perceptions of classroom instruction, and 3) perceptions of classroom innovation.\n\n \n\nWe argue from a systems perspective that innovations typically emerge from interaction, whether among people in a lab or firms in an economy.  Our primary goal was to develop an instrument that can be used to assess engineering students? perceptions of the important systems-level characteristics of interaction that are predictive of innovation in the classroom.  Our additional goals were to develop subscales that could be used to examine student perceptions of classroom instruction, and student perceptions of classroom innovation, so as to develop evidence for the relationship between instruction, interactive engagement, and student innovation.  Central to the scale development process was examining the internal consistency of our assessment instrument, as well as developing evidence for the external validity of the instrument by examining it in relation to other established instruments. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n Our hypothesis was that interactive engagement would be a better predictor of innovation in engineering classrooms than individual level engagement predictors.  Our results suggest that two latent constructs underlie the construct of interactive engagement, complexity and adaptivity.  Complexity is operationalized as a diverse group of student working together to achieve equilibrium.  Adaptivity is operationalized as students adjusting to a problem space by exploring possible solutions.  These two constructs, over three separate administrations of the instrument, have consistently predicted more variation in student classroom innovation than individual level engagement constructs common to STEM education research, in our Spring 2015 sample accounting for roughly 70% of the variation in student innovation in the way that we have measured it.  Active teaching accounts for roughly 40% of the variation in student complexity and adaptivity in our sample, providing additional evidence that targeting the ties between students in both research and teaching can yield improved insights into how students learn to innovate in the classroom. \n\nBroad Impacts\n\nThe results of our work have been presented at nationally attended conferences, reaching interested scholars and researchers.  Additionally, a technical manual, summarizing the nature of the assessment instrument, relevant psychometric data, and how to score and parcel the items is being distributed to engineering education researchers via popular web-based channels.  The project has also provided the opportunity for three graduate students to develop research and data analysis skills, all of whom leveraged the experience to move onto great opportunities including a job a Boeing, an NSF graduate research assistantship, and acceptance into a PhD program.  Moreover, new research questions that have been stimulated by our findings have been developed into NSF proposals to continue this line of research, proposing inventive research methods that can provide improved evidence for the usefulness of systems approaches to studying STEM classrooms.  This project exemplifies how focusing on new kinds of interactive variables, which explain larger portions of variation in learning outcomes that have social significance, like learning to innovate, can move education research forward.  Taking cues from other natural and social science disciplines, and operationalizing variables that target systems levels of analysis and ties between individuals or groups of individuals, can improve our ability to make smarter, more effective decisions in post-secondary classrooms that have a strong likelihood of impacting students in large-scale, meaningful ways.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jenefer E Husman"
