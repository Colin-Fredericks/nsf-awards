The PI will study documents including policy statements, field notes, scientific publications, supplementary maps, GIS coverages, demarcated areas, reports, memos; and identifying human (organizations, groups, individuals) and non-human actors (landforms, technologies, infrastructures), as a group of complementary and competing actor-networks. NVivo computer software will be used to store, organized, categorize, manipulate, and analyze data.\r\n\r\nThe PI will disseminate results directly to the populations studied via  a one hour presentation and informal roundtable to be held at several of the sites. Two journalism undergraduate students will help with the production of a non-academic report, production of a video, and creation of a website and interactive blog page.",
