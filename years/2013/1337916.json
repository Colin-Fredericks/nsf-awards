The instrument includes all the potential measurements typically offered by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), a torque magnetometer (TMM), and a magnetoresistance setup (MRS). The multifunctional magnetometer will play a key role in investigating the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic functional materials such as highly magnetostrictive alloys, low-dimensional magnetic hetero-structures, magnetic shape memories, magneto-electrics, and organic exciton multiferroics. Researchers will be able to conduct a range of magnetic and transport measurement  These measurements together with other techniques at the PIs institutions will be crucial in conducting cutting-edge research and advancing scientific knowledge in the field of magnetic materials. Knowledge acquired will contribute to engineering new advanced magnetics with superior performances over traditional materials, which will benefit the industrial sector.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award will provide Morgan State University with funds for purchasing a multifunctional magnetometer for collaborative research and education.  The instrument will be used to fulfill the needs of advanced magnetic characterization of various types of functional materials developed by the principal investigators (PIs) and their research partners at the University of Maryland, as well as to provide research training to students and faculty from their own institutions. This new instrument will facilitate the establishment of new research partnerships between the PIs and other scientists at other academic institutions and in industry. It will enhance the research infrastructure at Morgan State University (MSU), and will provide research opportunities to African-Americans, who are underrepresented in this field of science. The project will increase the competitiveness of the minority students in the area of magnetic materials at MSU. This will be done by providing a high quality of education and research training to the students involved in this program. This will have a significant impact on enhancing the opportunities for African-American graduates in the job market.",
