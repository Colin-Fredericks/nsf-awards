 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CC-NIE Integration project performed at the Louisiana State University is developing a cyber-infrastructure integrating six different large scale scientific research groups with high performance computing (HPC) clusters at LSU using software defined network technology and Hadoop and MPI (Message Passing Interface) based parallel frameworks.\r\n \r\nThe project consists of three objectives: (i) Building 10Gbps software-defined network (SDN) with OpenFlow switches and controllers to provide multiple virtual network slices to each group; (ii) Transferring Big Data with automatically tuned operation through multiple optical paths over the SDN network achieving at most 20Gbps of aggregated disk-to-disk transfer rate; and (iii) Analyzing Big Data by developing data-intensive distributed computing frameworks with Hadoop and MPI technologies parallelizing large number of jobs over HPC clusters.\r\n \r\nThose three components are integrated with a web portal service and a GENI-enabled network management system. To achieve high disk-to-disk transfer rate at 20Gbps, the project has an industrial partnership with Samsung Electronics that contributes 70TB Solid State Drive (SSD) storage and optimizes the I/O bandwidth.\r\n \r\nThe cyber-infrastructure accelerates the current Big Data research projects spanning a wide range of research areas including gene sequencing research at Biology and Vet School, computational chemistry, big data mining at Computer Science, coastal hazard simulation research at civil and environmental engineering. In the end, the project will establish a methodology to build integrated cyber-infrastructures consisting of high speed networks, high performance computing, and high speed storage for the Big Data Science and Engineering.",
