The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean algebra, lattice theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic topology.New Mexico State University will host the 2014 meeting and the University of North Texas will host the 2015 meeting.\r\n\r\nEach year this grant will support the participation of 15-20 graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s and 12 speakers. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. The conference series provides an environment for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in several related areas of the foundations of mathematics and provides them with a venue to showcase their own work.\r\n\r\nConference website is at  http://euclid.colorado.edu/~kearnes/blast",
