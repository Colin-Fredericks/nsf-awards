 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe mechanism for initial recognition and alignment between homologous chromosomes during meiosis is an essential basis of genetic inheritance in sexually reproducing organisms. The overall objective of this research is to define a mechanism for initial alignment of homologous chromosomes through histone modification using the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. Preliminary data indicate that a loss-of-function mutant of MRG-1, a component of a putative histone-modifying enzyme, exhibits a defect in the initial homologous alignment process. This defect does not seem to be an indirect consequence of altered expression of meiotic genes that could potentially result from a change in histone modification. Based on these and other preliminary studies, the hypothesis is that a particular state of histone modification catalyzed by the MRG-1-containing histone-modifying enzyme directly facilitates initial alignment of homologous chromosomes. This idea will be addressed using biochemical and genetic approaches. Successful completion of this research will advance fundamental understanding of chromosome dynamics by presenting the novel concept that histone modification affects interactions between homologous chromosomes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research will contribute to raising the scientific literacy among undergraduate students in genetics and chromosome biology in several ways. First, this research will provide ample opportunities for cutting-edge scientific research training to undergraduate students. Second, some undergraduate students will conduct an honors thesis project, in which they will also learn how to write a thesis based on the research that they conduct. Third, a larger group of undergraduates will be exposed to the research conducted by their peers in an upper-level seminar course focusing on chromosome structure and function. In addition, this research also involves training a postdoctoral fellow to become an independent researche through direct participation in the research, in discussion groups and journal clubs, and as a mentor to undergraduate students and/or rotation graduate students.",

This initial step is known to be independent of formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), which is the protein structure stabilizing association between homologous chromosomes along their entire length. Although the homologous recombination (HR)-dependent mechanism is widely known as a major activity for presynaptic homolog alignment in many organisms, some organisms (such as the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> and the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) primarily use the HR-independent mechanism for homologous alignment. Even in the organisms that use the HR-dependent mechanism, the initial alignment is carried out by the HR-independent mechanism whose detail remains unknown. In this project, we exploit <em>C. elegans</em> as a model organism to study the mechanism of presynaptic homologous alignment. In this study supported by the NSF award, we demonstrated that a component of the MYST-family histone acetyltransferase, MRG-1, directly facilitates presynaptic homologous alignment through its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. The concept that histone modification directly affects chromosome interactions is novel and significantly contributes advancing the meiosis study field. In order to demonstrate this new concept, we accomplished following two major goals: 1) determine which components of the MRG-1-containing histone-acethyltransferase is involved in initial homologous alignment <em>in vivo</em> using genetics and cell biology approaches, 2) determine which biochemical function of the MRG-1-containing histone-modifying enzyme is involved in initial homologous alignment. In addition to these two major goals, we also studied the effect of the meiotic quality control on apparent meiotic defect in the <em>mrg-1</em> mutant. While we were studying a role of MYST-HAT using <em>mrg-1</em> mutant, we realized that the meiotic quality control mechanism significantly decreases the number of germ cells with defective meiotic outcome as well as with a defect during meiotic prophase in the mutant. This finding provides important conceptual advancement in meiosis study. The strength of a meiotic defect is commonly used as an indicator of the strength of the defect in a particular meiotic mechanism under the study. However, our result demonstrates that actual mechanistic defect is not the only factor to define how strong a defective phenotype is in the mutant. Due to the elimination of the defective germ cells by meiotic quality control, the apparent phenotype becomes milder than the actual defect. This finding implies a possibility that has not been considered in any of previous meiotic study: if the efficacy of the meiotic quality control is not the same among multiple mutants, the strength of apparent meiotic defect would vary even when actual defect is the same among them. Therefore, the effect of meiotic quality control should be carefully taken into the consideration to precisely determine the strength of meiotic defect.
