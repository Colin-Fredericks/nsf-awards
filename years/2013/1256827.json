 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses how leaf, stem and root traits collectively influence organismal responses to different precipitation scenarios across multiple species in a Mediterranean-climate ecosystem.  Precipitation in arid and semi-arid environments can vary strongly within and across years and plant fitness can depend on rapid or efficient utilization of water during these events.  Plant species adapted to arid systems possess numerous leaf, stem and root traits that serve to minimize water stress, but it remains unclear whether these water conservation traits limit a plant's ability to rapidly respond to precipitation events and how water acquisition and conservation traits correspond to plant fitness.  The proposed research is organized around two questions: (1) is there a trade-off between the ability to respond to sudden changes in water availability and a water conservation strategy, and (2) how do traits pertaining to water acquisition and conservation correlate with plant fitness and how does this depend on the magnitude and frequency of precipitation?  These questions will be examined in four annual and six perennial species from a southern California coastal sage scrub community.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how biochemical, morphological and physiological processes result in integrated organismal responses to environmental variation will improve predictive models of community response to climate change.  Mediterranean-climate ecosystems are among the regions of the world most likely to be affected by climate change and the proposed work will collect critical information needed to restore these unique, threatened ecosystems.  For example, understanding how species use water under a variety of precipitation scenarios may improve restoration efforts in systems invaded by exotic plant species by allowing resource managers to identify native species that use resources in a similar way, which may increase community resilience to invasion.  \r\n    \r\nThis CAREER proposal represents a fully integrated plan of research and education though supervised and independent research (undergraduate, high school summer internships) and courses at the undergraduate and high school level.  The study will be conducted at a small, undergraduate institution and will provide four undergraduate researchers per year with opportunities to enhance research, analytical and communication skills.  Most of these students will continue into graduate programs or pursue careers in ecology or plant biology.  Students from four upper-division biology courses will be directly involved in collecting and analyzing data from the proposed field experiment.  High school science students from traditionally underrepresented groups will participate in weekly meetings at the PIs lab to set up a greenhouse experiment and collect and analyze data.  High school students will also participate in weekend field trips and have the opportunity to conduct summer internships. The research grant will also help to establish long-term plots for the young female professor who is serving as the PI.  The PI will engage the scientific community, resource managers and the general public through public lectures, local restoration activities, and continued collaborations with resource managers at the Irvine Ranch Conservancy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research addresses how leaf, stem, and root traits collectively influence organismal responses to different precipitation scenarios across multiple species in a Mediterranean-climate ecosystem.  Precipitation in arid and semi-arid environments can vary strongly within and across years and plant performance can depend on rapid or efficient utilization of water during these events.  Plant species adapted to arid systems possess numerous leaf, stem, and root traits that serve to minimize water stress, but it remains unclear whether these water conservation traits limit a plant?s ability to rapidly respond to precipitation events and how water acquisition and conservation traits correspond to plant fitness.  The proposed research is organized around two questions: (1) is there a trade-off between the ability to respond to sudden changes in water availability and a water conservation strategy, and (2) how do traits pertaining to water acquisition and conservation correlate with plant performance and how does this depend on the magnitude and frequency of precipitation?\n\n \n\nObjective 1.  Species-level trait data collected from a field experiment and two greenhouse experiments will be combined to assess trade-offs between resource acquisition and conservation.  This synthesis is ongoing.\n\n \n\nObjective 2.  Data from a field experiment and several greenhouse experiments suggest that there is substantial variation in traits across species and that traits are differentially linked to performance across species.  We used several greenhouse experiments with potted plants to conduct mechanistic trait studies of species and their response to variation in water availability.  In one study, we observed substantial variation in root attributes and their response to water availability across 18 species. Notably, we found strong support for a belowground trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation, and our data suggest that specific root length and root diameter ? two commonly used indicators of root function ? may not be the best predictors of plant growth.  In another study, we measured above- and belowground physiological and morphological traits of 23 grass and forb species and monitored plant survival over a prolonged drought.  Species that persisted longer during the drought were smaller (low total leaf mass and root length) with more resource-conservative tissues (low specific root length, high root tissue density).  Thus, there appears to be fitness consequences of a drought escape strategy under extreme drought in herbaceous species. \n\n \n\nIn a field experiment, we measured above- and below-ground traits and reproductive allocation for four annual and four perennial species from a coastal sage scrub community in California under conditions of 50%, 100%, and 150% ambient precipitation.  We expected to see similar leaf trait-fitness relationships and different root trait-fitness relationships between annual species and drought-deciduous perennials, which have similar patterns of leaf phenology but longer-lived stem and root tissues relative to annuals.  Across the water gradient, leaf attributes associated with resource acquisition (e.g., low leaf mass per area, high photosynthetic rate) were positively correlated with fitness in annual species and two of the four perennial species.  In contrast, water-use and root traits were inconsistently or poorly correlated with fitness, respectively, for most species.  Trait-fitness relationships were fairly constant across the water gradient for annuals, indicating that resource acquisitive attributes were beneficial for annuals independent of whether they were growing under conditions of low or high water availability.  In contrast, perennials displayed fewer significant trait-fitness relationships when examined within individual precipitation treatments.  Differences in trait-fitness relationships across traits and species may complicate efforts to use functional traits to predict species responses to environmental variation, especially in communities characterized by high life history diversity. \n\n \n\nThis project had several broader impacts.  First, the project supported a diverse group of undergraduate students and 40 high school students.  Many of the undergraduate students presented their research at local and national meetings and contributed to and/or authored publications.  It also advanced the research program of an early-career female scientist (Jennifer Funk).  Second, the results from our experiments extend our understanding of what traits are most strongly linked to plant performance under different precipitation scenarios and how species may differentially respond to climate change.  Understanding species response to precipitation in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems, which experience strong unevenness in water availability across and within years, is important because they are global biodiversity hotspots and are under increasing development pressure because of favorable climate, agricultural productiveness, and coastal locations.  Finally, this project also enhanced our understanding of how invasive species will respond to changes in precipitation.  Invasive species are one of the most serious agents of global change are widespread in many Mediterranean-climate ecosystems. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer L Funk"
