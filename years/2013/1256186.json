 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature plays a key role in setting species ranges and driving evolutionary patterns on broad spatial and temporal scales. However, interpretation of the role of temperature in ecology and evolution may be confounded by complex spatial patterns of temperature variation. Within very small coastal intertidal areas, the investigators have documented micro-scale variation in body temperature among individuals that can exceed the average range of body temperature along an entire coastline. Essentially, different organisms experience the same environment in different ways. This micro-scale variation among individuals represents a critical caveat to the conclusion that a number of species currently live close to their temperature tolerance limits; instead, only some individuals do so. It is important to understand the causes and consequences of such micro-scale variation, particularly when attempting to forecast the large-scale outcomes of climatic changes. This project uses the sea mussel as a model system for a combination of field and laboratory studies designed first to answer two mechanistic questions: (1) How does micro-scale variation in body temperature arise, and do individuals use behavioral responses to modify their body temperature based on their recent experience? (2) Is variation in thermal history, the amount of recent heating, correlated with physiological abilities of individuals to combat stress associated with extreme temperatures? The investigators will first quantify the magnitude and the temporal persistence of micro-scale variation in body temperature (a necessity before scaling up to address broad ecological and evolutionary questions) and then link specific biochemical markers of thermal stress in individuals with their unique thermal histories. Finally, the investigators will address the potential sources of micro-scale variation in thermal physiology. Is inter-individual variation a function of variation in recent thermal history, or derived from fixed physiological differences between individuals in warm vs. cool microhabitats, or is individual physiological variation masked in the field by variation in other environmental factors such as food availability or by behavior? Inter-individual variation is an important, understudied aspect of organismal biology. This research will link inter-individual variation in physiology with parallel environmental variation to deepen understanding of evolutionary potential of species to cope with global change. To accomplish this goal, the team will integrate biochemical, behavioral, and biophysical approaches in field and laboratory studies. Importantly, a new understanding will be gained of the oxidative stress mechanisms that may set thermal tolerance costs and limits among species and among populations of a single species. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts are focused on integration of undergraduate teaching and research by forming a collaboration between Loyola Marymount University [LMU, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) with 21% Latino/Hispanic population] and Stanford University. LMU undergraduates will be immersed in summer research at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station, greatly enhancing their professional development and future career perspectives. A postdoctoral researcher based at LMU will receive PUI-specific professional development in research, classroom teaching, and student mentoring while enjoying access to world-class resources, expertise, and an excellent field site at Stanford. Finally, methods and findings of the research will be incorporated into several undergraduate courses at LMU.",

However, interpretation of the role of temperature in ecology and evolution may be confounded by complex spatial patterns of temperature variation. Within very small coastal rocky intertidal areas, the investigators have documented what they call \"micro-scale\" variation in body temperature among individuals that can exceed the average range of body temperature along an entire coastline. Essentially, different organisms experience the same environment in different ways. This micro-scale variation among individuals represents a critical caveat to the conclusion that a number of species currently live close to their temperature tolerance limits; instead, only some individuals do so. It is important to understand the causes and consequences of such micro-scale variation, particularly when attempting to forecast the large-scale outcomes of climatic changes. This project used the sea mussel (Mytilus californianus) as a model system for a combination of field and laboratory studies designed first to answer two mechanistic questions: (1) How does micro-scale variation in body temperature arise, and do individuals use behavioral responses to modify their body temperature based on their recent experience? Using a custom-built, field-capable, microprocessor sensor package (MusselTracker), the investigators found that body temperature variation among neighboring individuals is dramatic &ndash; up to 15 degrees C during a given low tide period. Furthermore, individual mussels show no evidence of adjusting their shell gaping behavior or their body posture relative to sunlight to mitigate the effects of heat stress. (2) Is variation in thermal history, the amount of recent heating, correlated with physiological abilities of individuals to combat stress associated with extreme temperatures? Having quantified the magnitude and the temporal persistence of small-scale variation in body temperature, the investigators then linked specific biochemical markers of thermal stress in individuals with their unique environmental experiences. Overall, individuals exposed to greater levels of heat stress are indeed more likely to accumulate biomarkers of cellular damage; this is one of the first times such an intuitive finding has been documented in a natural setting. The investigators addressed the potential sources of inter-individual variation in thermal physiology in their final question: (3) Is inter-individual variation a function of variation in recent thermal history, or derived from fixed physiological differences between individuals in warm vs. cool microhabitats, or is individual physiological variation masked in the field by variation in other environmental factors such as food availability or by behavior? The simple answer is that many processes contribute to inter-individual variation. Recent experience certainly matters, as documented in question 2. In a separate experiment the investigators found that physiological variation among neighboring individuals, in this case in measures of the ability to resist oxidative stress, was greatest in magnitude when the environmental conditions were closest to the species physiological limits. In other words, intense stress amplifies differences among individuals that might otherwise go undetected. In addition, the investigators found evidence that the environmental conditions experienced by juvenile mussels early in development (when they are first ready to compete for space among larger adults in mussel beds) may set lifelong thermal tolerance.
