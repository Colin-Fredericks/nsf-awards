This  new  cohort  will  build  on  our  six previous  efforts   that  have  not  only  significantly  added to  the UREP  STEM  graduate  enrollment  and  masters  and  doctoral  degrees  but  have  also  led  to  important  changes  in  the  culture  and  practice  of  STEM  education  in  ways  that  not  only  help  UREP  students  but  all  graduate  STEM  students.   \r\nC1. Project Goals and Objectives\r\nThe goals and objectives of the SUNY LSAMP 2013 Bridge to the Doctorate Program at Albany are:\r\nTo recruit 12 LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate students by:\r\n-  Using recruitment pathways that we have developed that target the state and national LSAMP pool and recruit students from a variety of LSAMP institutions and STEM majors.\r\n-  Having a selection process that works with STEM departments and SUNY AGEP to choose talented LSAMP students who will succeed with program support\r\nTo design and implement a program that helps students successfully complete two years of STEM graduate study by:\r\n-  Providing a comprehensive set of services that monitor student progress, builds a strong BD community, builds BD students? academic and professional skills and uses UREP STEM graduate students as mentors and instructors wherever possible\r\n- Collaborating with other NSF and state and federal programs to make the best use of program resources by integrating BD students into the existing network of activities and programs\r\n-  Assessing the success of program services through external evaluation and developing new or modified activities or interventions based on the results of this evaluation  \r\nTo make sure that BD students enter and successfully complete doctoral study and then move into academia and the high technology workplace by:\r\n-  Helping students to successfully gain admission into doctoral programs\r\n-  Preparing BD students to apply for NSF and other graduate fellowships \r\n-  Working with STEM departments, The  Office of Graduate Studies and the Carson Carr Fellowship program to develop plans to provide a formal pathway to PhD programs that include financial support for BD students after the two years of BD NSF support ends\r\n- Working with STEM departments to provide academic support where needed to help students through doctoral study \r\n- Maintaining an effective system for tracking students after they leave the BD program through their educational career and professional work experience\r\nTo promote systemic change in graduate STEM policy and practices in ways that will increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of UREP STEM graduate education by: \r\n-   Using resources from multiple sources to examine broad issues related to UREP STEM graduate education using the BD, AGEP and UREP STEM graduate population\r\nINTELLECTUAL  MERIT  The  project  will  add  to  current  efforts  by  SUNY  LSAMP  to  build  research  capacity  in  STEM  education  in  the  area  of  graduate  education.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  study  of  the  Bridge  to  the  Doctorate  Program  will  be  put  into  the  context  of  broader  issues  of  systemic  change  and  disseminated  to  a  broad  national  audience    \r\nBROADER  IMPACT  Using  the  lessons  learned  from  this  project,  we  expect  to  continue  to  develop  and  refine  strategies  that  will  increase  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  UREP  STEM  graduate students.  This  will increase  the  number  of  UREP  STEM  students  who  successfully  complete  doctoral  degrees  in  STEM  disciplines  and  make  changes  in  STEM  departmental  culture  and  practice.",
