 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this program is to develop memory devices and magnetic tunnel junctions, based on controlling the magnetic state of dilute magnetic III-Nitride semiconductors. These device structures will show that manipulation of spin states is feasible in dilute magnetic GaN. The success of this program will be a step towards the realization of non-volatile memory in dilute magnetic GaN. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The program will utilize controlling magnetism at hetero-structure interfaces to build memory devices and magnetic sensors that manipulate the spin states by an external electric field. The research project will focus on meeting the following goals: i) Establish correlations between mediated carriers and the ferromagnetic properties in magnetically doped GaN. ii) Demonstrate electric field control of ferromagnetism in memory cells. iii) Demonstrate magnetic sensors based on the magneto-resistance properties of magnetic-GaN/p-GaN layered structures.\r\nBroader impacts: Coupling semiconductor devices with spin-electronic applications has the potential for room temperature nitride-based magnetic devices. The structures considered are transformative by the realization of room-temperature non-volatile memory and sensor devices based on III-nitrides. For educational outreach, a study group will work with the School of science on the NCSU Centennial Campus to make exciting new electro-magnetic devices.",
