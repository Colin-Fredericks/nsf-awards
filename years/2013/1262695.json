The PI is requesting partial travel support for participants from the US to attend this international meeting in the field of molecular sieve membranes.  The bulk of the requested funds will support travel expenses for young investigators from the US.  IZMM 2013 is the continuation of a successful series of meetings including the IZMM conferences at Gifu, Japan (1998), Purmerend , The Netherlands (2001), Breckenridge, Colorado (2004), Zaragoza, Spain (2007), and Loutraki , Greece.  In this focused meeting, the scientists and engineers from both academia and industry around the world will present, share, and discuss their recent findings, new ideas, and challenges regarding the synthesis, characterization, and applications of membranes of zeolites and related molecular sieves including metal-organic frameworks, an emerging class of nanoporous materials.  Emerging applications of zeolite films as membrane-, nano- and micro-reactors for applications in the chemical, petrochemical, and biorefinery industries and as components of fuel cells and electronic devices will be discussed.    Broader Impacts: Emphasis will be placed on the technological and scientific challenges that should be overcome for further commercial development of zeolite-film-based products to solve important societal and technological problems.  Participants will identify the future challenges for research in this rapidly evolving field.  The meeting will provide the means for young faculty and graduate students to present their work and establish themselves in the international community with the expectation that it will catalyze the formation of international collaborations.",
