For well-developed flows, certain rheological approaches have been put forward, however these break down in regions of less rapid motion, where a markedly different behavior is observed that has resisted theoretical treatment for years.  To produce a general granular flow model that combines the fast and slow regimes, together with appropriate plasticity relations for transient effects, would constitute a major step forward in the field and a lucrative tool in engineering design and geophysics.  Inspired by recent successes in the study of emulsion flow, this project will investigate a nonlocal constitutive approach, whose direct inclusion of a particle length-scale may provide the missing piece.  With sophisticated and customized finite-element tools, preliminary tests indicate that this strategy leads to quantitatively accurate well-developed flow predictions in multiple flow geometries, including one family of geometries whose flow fields have never previously been described by a continuum model.  Certain additional tests will be performed to clarify potential limitations of the model.  To move beyond well-developed behavior and broaden the model, research will be conducted to merge the technique within a critical-state framework to capture transient dilation/strengthening/softening effects.  Another aim is to build an improved theory for the nonlocal mechanism, and in so doing improve the interpretation of boundary conditions and thin-body effects.  Once dry flows are understood in this way, enhanced finite-element tools shall be taken advantage of yet again to model fluid-saturated grains. The similar foundations of this model and related approaches used for emulsions draw important connections between granular matter and other amorphous materials. The flow-induces-flow mechanism and its ability to reproduce flow and stress fields so accurately suggests a microscopic picture that could solve many open questions in particulate flow problems.  The theoretical investigation will help clarify this basic mechanism to improve generalization to other matter. The finite-element tools developed to implement the nonlocal granular flow model also open the door to modeling multiple coupled effects in particulate systems --- fluid permeability as mentioned, but conceivably a combination of other effects like electric-field interactions, diffusing species effects, and heat conduction.\r\n\r\nOwing to the many fundamental applications of granular flow in industry, science, and engineering, the approach we propose  together with its demonstrated accuracy will provide a key tool for predicting flows in general circumstances.  The work to be carried out also involves a significant and integrated educational component.  The PI has conducted several innovations in online education at MIT and proposes a number of ways to improve residential and public education using online tools.  Presentations will also be made in the MIT Minority Introduction to Science and Engineering program, a six-week summer program encouraging talented minority students to pursue degrees in technical fields.  Moreover, the PI will involve undergraduates in the research process and integrate research problems into his teaching.  Broader impact within the scientific community will be made through continued organization of the New England Workshop on the Mechanics of Materials and Structures, and the APS mini-symposium Continuum Descriptions of Discrete Materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award spurned the development and validation of a general continuum model that predicts granular flows in a variety of circumstances.  The key ingredient of this model is the direct inclusion of the mean grain-size, d, within the flow rule.  This \"size-effect\" makes granular flow modeling distinct from more standard fluids and solids because the material behaves in a non-local way.  That is, the way the material flows under a stress is not just given by the size of the stress at some point but by a state field that is influenced by flow happening everywhere else.  The reason for this effect is the fact that grains having a finite size means that a flow event at a certain position propagates a chain of events that disturbs materials over some characteristic multiple of d away.  The effect is non-trivial and plays a significant role in the development of granular flow fields, but it has been historically difficult to model.\n\nThe succes of our model, which we call the \"Nonlocal Granular Fluidity\" (NGF) model, can be seen in its ability to quantitatively predict flows in many different 2D geometries and over a hundred 3D experiments, each without parameter adjustment. This level of generality and precision is unprescendented in granular flow theory, especially for a model in which only one new material parameter is introduced. There are a number of other manifestations of finite-size effects that have been observed in granular materials and it appears NGF explains these equally well, including the fact that thin zones of grains behave as if they are stronger and the \"secondary rheology\" phenomenon wherein far-away motion effectively erases the yield criterion everywhere. To illustrate the physical consistency of the model we have carried out an in-depth thermomechanical analysis of the system, and have performed a parameter study to understand the basis of our new material parameter, the nonlocal amplitude.  The non-local state field, called the granular fluidity, has also been shown to have a real kinematic meaning, reflecting the particle fluctuations and packing fraction of the material.  A book chapter and review article have recently been written discussing this model.\n\n \n\nIn parallel to nonlocal model development, this award led to the development of a very robust numerical implementation for highly deforming granular flow models, based on the meshfree Material Point Method.  Our approach lets one simulate a bulk of granular media as a continuum that can (and frequently does) change phase --- it can flow like a fluid, solidify into am elastic solid, or separate into a gas-like state --- allowing simulations of complex situations such as impact and penetration.  The approach has been worked into a mixture framework that lets us simulate arbitrary mixtures of granular material and fluid as a two-phase media, each phase (water and solid) coupled to each other.  The approach spans the limits from dense slurries up to dilute suspensions and allows the simulations of multiple geo-mechanical and industrially relevant geometries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth Kamrin"
