 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Proper replication and maintenance of the DNA genome is essential for cell growth, function, and viability. When cells are exposed to environmental stresses that damage DNA, pathways for repairing the DNA damage are induced.  One key player in this damage control is Replication Protein A (RPA), a complex of three proteins that serves as a \"bridge\" between damaged DNA and the machinery needed to repair the damage. In this capacity, RPA has the potential to interact with many proteins, but how specificity of those interactions is determined is not clear.  One idea is that stress-induced phosphorylation of RPA mediates differential interaction between RPA and various proteins involved in DNA repair.  This research will test that hypothesis by identifying which amino acid residues in the RPA proteins are phosphorylated, how phosphorylation affects physical interactions between RPA and different protein partners, and what impact RPA phosphorylation has on the ability of cells to maintain proper growth and viability.  The research will be carried out in baker's yeast, which is amenable to both genetic and biochemical manipulation and is accessible to researchers of all skill levels.  Because RPA is highly conserved (from yeast to human), the research findings will advance understanding of how eukaryotes coordinate DNA repair processes for maintaining genome integrity and cellular viability. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Centered at North Dakota State University, this project will contribute to learning and research opportunities science for college students in rural North Dakota and surrounding states by:  improving molecular biology course content; expanding educational opportunities for non-traditional students through development of distance-learning courses in molecular biology, cell biology, genetics and biochemistry; providing opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct hands-on laboratory research; and providing a pipeline for interested students to obtain master's degrees as prerequisite for entering a new doctoral research program in STEM education. By fostering student literacy in science, this project will enable North Dakota State University to produce graduates with a solid scientific foundation that could positively impact their future contributions to society.",

Subsequently, Rfa2 phosphorylation overcomes the effects of Rfa1 and Rfa2 lysine modifications to release the cells from the checkpoint and allow cell cycle re-entry (Figure 5).

This project addressed the limited resources and opportunities to perform cutting-edge molecular biology research at NDSU. Included in this project was support for improving the only basic molecular biology lab course offered on campus. To this end, the lab has been moved to a larger, recently renovated space, new equipment has been supplied through project funds and through matches by the department, and more current, cutting-edge technologies are now employed. This recombinant DNA technology course has grown from simple DNA amplification and cloning techniques into a semester-long independent research project involving gene mutation/knockout in an organism, as well as genotyping, and gene expression analyses. The technology used for gene manipulation, CRISPR-Cas9, involves both basic and complex recombinant DNA technologies, and this course curriculum has even been presented at a biotechnology symposium (Figure 6). It is the only molecular biology class providing this type of experience to all students pursuing the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) major at NDSU. Furthermore, we are unaware of any other courses offered in the region that provide this type of hands-on experience to all interested students and not just through individual independent research experiences. This project has also been helpful in supporting NDSU's acceptance as one of 84 schools accredited by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). Beyond the classroom, this project has provided training to seven graduate students, two of which have entered the biotechnology workforce, three of which are currently in training, and all of which have presented their work to national and international audiences. With respect to undergraduate training, this project has provided opportunities to nearly twenty students, many who have gone on to postgraduate education in medicine, biomedical and agricultural molecular biology research, and even in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education research, and will become professional STEM members contributing to the community.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stuart&nbsp;J&nbsp;Haring</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253723/1253723_10234395_1564692366056_Figure05-ProjectOutcomesReport-HaringSJ--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253723/1253723_10234395_1564692366056_Figure05-ProjectOutcomesReport-HaringSJ--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5 - Model for RFA modifications regulating both checkpoint entry and exit.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1253723/1253723_10234395_1564692366056_Figure05-ProjectOutcomesReport-HaringSJ--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5 - Model for RFA modifications regulating both checkpoint entry and exit.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Upon DNA damage, Rfa1 modified on lysines is required for full Mec1 (ATR) activity and Rad53 phosphorylation (checkpoint entry).
