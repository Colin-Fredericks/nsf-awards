 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the University of California Merced (UCM) that will provide research training for eight students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The Yosemite Environmental Science Research Training REU program will be based at the Yosemite Field Station in Yosemite National Park (YNP). Students will be involved in research projects with UC Merced faculty mentors and YNP/United States Geological Survey co-mentors that span a range of sub-disciplines, but that all use the \"living laboratory\" of Yosemite to answer key questions in environmental science. These projects examine both the unique ecosystems and organisms found within Yosemite (i.e., montane meadows and the Great Gray Owl), as well as key processes of broad relevance (i.e., fire and hydrology). Many of the projects seek to understand human interactions with and alteration of ecosystems, organisms, and processes; these include quantifying local impacts (e.g., pack stock use and visitation patterns), as well as the effects of global change. Project results will contribute fundamental scientific knowledge to a variety of fields, while also generating information of direct value to natural resource managers. REU student outreach activities will be broad and diverse, including a public presentation of their research open to the Yosemite community and YNP's many visitors. Training will include a session on scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research led by staff from the Office of Research at UC Merced during the first week of the program. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional \"hard copy\" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in the environmental sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of a REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://snri.ucmerced.edu/Yosemite_REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Stephen C. Hart at shart4@ucmerced.edu) or co-PI (Dr. J. Michael Beman at mbeman@ucmerced.edu).",
