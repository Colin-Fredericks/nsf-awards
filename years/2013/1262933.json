 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at East Carolina University.  The focus of the site is on the foundations, tools, and applications of software testing.  Software testing is widely used to ensure the quality of software systems.  Improvements to the foundations, tools, and applications of software testing will help improve the quality of software systems and reduce the cost of software development.  The site will provide undergraduate students with research experience in software testing and give them a solid research foundation by participating in activities, such as developing solutions and algorithms for fundamental issues in software testing, developing tools to improve testing effectiveness and performance, and testing complex real systems.\r\n\r\nThis site will provide the opportunity for 30 undergraduate students over three years to participate in a supportive environment that encourages them to pursue graduate studies in computer science.  The REU project will also provide students an opportunity to collaborate with their faculty mentors and/or student peers after the summer program.",
