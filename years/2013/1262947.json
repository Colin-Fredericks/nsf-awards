 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projects will make immediate and significant contributions to research on the performance of fatty acid methyl esters in automobile engine combustion and emissions. The topic is well suited to undergraduate exploration and focuses on urgent energy problems ranging from energy depletion to global climate change to national security. The program will promote development and application of reformulated biofuels technology with strong potential to advance the current state of research. REU students will work hands-on projects on formulating new biofuels and developing hybrid combustion technologies and they will report their results in scientific papers. The overall REU project will achieve the following transformative objectives: (1) increase fundamental and experimental knowledge of the physical and chemical structure of the pure fatty acids and their methyl esters C16:0-C18:3 as surrogates for biodiesel to optimize fuel formulations; (2) elucidate the chemical influence of pure methyl esters C16:0-C18:3 and their blends on mixture formation, ignition delay, heat release, combustion phasing, and combustion chamber heat transfer; and (3) establish their impact on gas, particulate emissions, and efficiency in diesel engines.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Southern University's Allen E. Paulson Research Laboratory for Renewable Energy and Engines will offer interdisciplinary research experiences for 10 engineering undergraduate students for 10 weeks each summer from 2013 to 2015. The program aims to increase students' interest in conducting research; understanding of interdisciplinary concepts through hands-on-learning; STEM problem-solving skills and ability to apply them to research; independence as well as ability to collaborate effectively as part of a highly diverse team; and communication competence at both the interpersonal and presentational level. They will attend lectures, seminars, workshops, labs, and field trips to develop their knowledge of, and skills in, renewable energy, research methods, and technical writing. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include significantly increasing participation of female, minority, and other students underrepresented in engineering research careers. The program will (a) establish novel collaborations between Georgia Southern University, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and non-PhD institutions in Georgia and across USA; (b) promote undergraduate research; (c) prepare a new generation of scientific leaders from diverse populations; (d) advance cooperation with, and develop the workforce for, the biofuels and automotive industries; and e) develop research-based educational materials. The results of student projects will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, such as Elsevier Energy, Applied Tribology, and Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, and at the professional conferences of the SAE, ASME, DEER, ASEE, and EPA.",
