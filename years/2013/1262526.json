 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the spatial variability of municipal setback policies in major shale gas areas in Texas.  In this case setback distance can be conceptualized as an absolute space between gas wells and homes, as well as the product of negotiations and knowledge transfers among key policy actors.  By examining the processes underlying the way in which setback distances are set, this research will fill a knowledge gap in the understanding of the placement of shale gas wells, contribute to emergent geographical theories on the mobility of policies across institutional landscapes, and provide critical information for analyzing present and future debates surrounding shale gas drilling in populated areas.  The study will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods and will collect data in several municipalities.  First, a geographic Information System (GIS) database will be developed to identify and stratify cities based on setback distances and gas well density.  Second, interviews will be conducted with multiple policy stakeholders to determine their ideas about, understanding of, and role in establishing setback policies.  Interview data will be analyzed to determine how setback ordinances diffuse, mutate, and/or evolve among municipalities.  \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to on-going policy discussions about shale gas drilling and its impact on residential areas throughout the United States.  Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at the University of North Texas and Texas A&M University will be recruited to participate in the research.  These students will be trained through hands-on field research and data preparation, workshops, mentoring, and will be given opportunities to publicly present their research findings.  In addition, the research will become a component of an undergraduate Geography of Energy course that will include a research component.  A third component incorporates the GIS products generated from this study into a module for high school students.  The module will allow students to determine how GIS tools can be used to understand human dimensions of hydrocarbon extraction; it will also become a tangible educational product to foster additional outreach programs at other high schools.  Finally, this study will inform local, regional, national, and international policies on shale gas drilling in populated areas.  A clear understanding of the motives behind gas well ordinances and the goals of setback distances and how policies formulated in one place are applied elsewhere will be relevant for communities around the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe United States is the world?s largest producer of shale gas and petroleum, unconventional forms of hydrocarbons that require hydraulic fracturing.  Rapid increases in shale gas drilling occurred after 2002, particularly in the Barnett, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford plays in Texas. The Barnett is noteworthy because parts of it underlie the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW), which became the site of the world?s largest and longest experiment in urban shale gas drilling, while the Eagle Ford experienced rapid increase in drilling and oil output.\n\nChristian Brannstrom and Matthew Fry investigated several geographical aspects of unconventional oil and gas planning and policies, reaching some novel conclusions and producing notable broader impacts.  They analyzed the origins and purposes of municipal hydrocarbon ordinances in DFW.  They determined that municipalities in DFW created and borrowed new drilling ordinances that aimed to regulate hydraulic fracturing while satisfying competing demands of hydrocarbon firms, property owners, and residents. By 2014, 58 municipalities in DFW had established drilling regulations.  Setback distances, defined as the distance between drilling sites and residences, parks, schools, and health care facilities, were the main way in which municipalities regulated drilling. For example, in Dallas, which increased setback distance in December 2013 from 300 feet to 1,500 feet (457.2 meters), policymakers copied many regulatory provisions from other cities and ceded some political processes to a task force, aiming to make setbacks technical rather than political.\n\nThe investigators determined that ordinances in DFW municipalities varied over time, with an initial period (2002) involving no public involvement, task forces, or borrowing.  Between 2003 and 2008, public involvement increased while industry involvement remained high, and copying of other ordinances was high.  After 2008, municipalities experienced higher public involvement and greater use of task forces, while having far less borrowing than during 2003-2008. \n\nBrannstrom and Fry found that municipal officials understood the objectives of drilling ordinances as primarily protecting public health and safety, but officials repeatedly indicated that the proper setback distance was the balance among several priorities, such as preventing noise complaints, preserving home property value, avoiding industry lawsuits, and encouraging mineral production.  Additionally, officials share the concern that gas wells impede future urban development, although some officials are content to trade increased royalties to their municipality for constraints on future growth.\n\nProject activities also included analysis of spatial aspects of gas well production sites in DFW, finding that sites cover 3000 ha overall.  In some rapidly growing municipalities, nearly 2% of surface areas was covered with drilling operations.  This finding, coupled with concerns over future growth, suggests that municipalities should develop policies for reverse setback distances, which would regulate the proximity between new homes to existing gas wells.  Moreover, notification mandates to property owners within setback distances could help protect health, safety, and welfare of residents.\n\nTurning to the Eagle Ford Shale, Brannstrom and Fry investigated how unconventional petroleum extraction influenced economic development outcomes. Municipal stakeholders approach economic development goals from the perspective of employment, housing, and road quality. These findings were used to update John Gilmore?s models of boomtown development, which had been originally proposed in the mid 1970s.  Investigators also determined that, for one county in the Eagle Ford, 96% of assessed mineral wealth concentrates among energy firms and individuals located in Texas metropolitan regions, while 1.95% of mineral wealth remains local to the county of production.\n\nFinally, Brannstrom and Fry trained two undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;M University in geographical science and policy analysis through hands-on field research and data preparation, workshops, mentoring, and opportunities to publicly present our findings.  One of these students is continuing study at the doctoral level, using some the methods implemented in this project.  Brannstrom and Fry also developed and co-lead a field trip relating to shale gas extraction as part of teaching courses in energy geographies at Texas A&amp;M University and University of North Texas, respectively.  They developed a learning module on the use of geospatial tools to examine human dimensions of hydrocarbon extraction, which investigators used in undergraduate courses and to show high school students an example of geospatial analysis.  Brannstrom and Fry also shared our data with Texas newspapers, while they and their students published op-ed essays reporting findings. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christian Brannstrom"
