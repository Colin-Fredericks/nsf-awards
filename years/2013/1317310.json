 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, \"Graduate 10K+,\" an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), the most common reason for which first-year students withdraw from engineering is failure in freshman calculus courses. To address this barrier to retention, the project is providing a design-based context for learning in the freshman calculus sequence by development and implementation of engineering experiences that target key mathematical concepts with which students typically struggle.  The goal of this project is to decrease failure rates in the redesigned first-year calculus courses by 50 percent, raising first-year retention by 100 students annually to 94 percent, and increasing the number of engineering graduates from the Cockrell School of Engineering at UT Austin by 110 per year.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the transformed recitation sections of the freshman calculus sequence that are being developed based on evidence-based practices.  At full scale-up of the program, a total of 1000 engineering students are enrolled in the transformed recitation sections of freshman calculus classes.  Course modules are being developed through collaborative efforts between engineering and mathematics faculty, while a Fellow in Engineering Education, mathematics teaching assistants, and engineering learning assistants implement the transformed recitations.  The recitation sections, which engage students in solving design-based engineering problems by applying the concepts being taught in the calculus course, are using a combination of self-paced, online instructional materials and active, instructor- and peer-facilitated, team-based activities. Students view online background information about engineering challenges and work basic problems prior to class, then solve additional problems and discuss design implications in their recitation sections.  The design-based engineering problems also are being incorporated into subsequent fundamental engineering courses including Statics, Dynamics, and Transport Phenomena. \r\n\r\nThe project's broader impacts are being realized in the comprehensive dissemination of the transformed freshman calculus model and course material to universities in the University of Texas System, UTeach replication sites, and other institutions.  In addition, the UTeachEngineering program is adopting the material in the curriculum for the year-long high school course \"Engineering Your World,\" which has been adopted by more than 100 schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Texas at Austin STEP project, Improving Retention in Engineering by Incorporating Applications in Freshman Calculus, created 22 modules designed to deepen student understanding of calculus concepts and the application of those concepts in engineering.  The modules were used and evaluated in both first-year calculus courses and General Engineering (GE) courses that primarily serve engineering students at risk of poor performance in calculus.  The goals of developing and implementing the modules were to promote success in freshman calculus and subsequent calculus-based engineering courses, and to improve first-year engineering student retention.\n\nThe modules were developed by a team including mathematicians and engineers from a variety of fields.  The team created a suite of both hands-on and simulated modules that provide students with opportunities to apply the mathematics they are learning in their calculus courses to a variety of engineering contexts with the intention that these applications will maintain or improve student attitudes toward engineering, promote deeper mathematical engagement and learning in calculus, and foster engineering retention.\n\nFrom Spring 2014 through Fall 2016, the modules were used in calculus recitation sections. Starting in Spring 2017, the STEP team began transitioning the engineering modules into General Engineering (GE) courses that serve primarily engineering students at risk of poor performance in calculus. The project team believed a transition into GE courses would facilitate greater, more sustainable impact, as implementation could be standardized across classes and instructors would have greater understanding and promote buy-in. \n\nThe initial modules developed by the team were exclusively hands-on activities.  This created a variety of logistical difficulties in delivering the modules to large numbers of students in diverse classroom settings.  The project team experimented with simulation-based modules that avoided these logistical difficulties, and subsequent evaluation found that the simulation-based modules were as effective as the hands-on modules in settings where the goal is to reach very large numbers of students.  The final collection of modules developed by the team includes hands-on modules, simulation based modules, and modules with the potential for multiple modes of delivery.     \n\nMajor accomplishments of the project team included:\n\nWorking with engineers across multiple disciplines and mathematics faculty to create modules that support mathematics understanding, engineering interest and engineering motivation;\nCreating complete lessons, relevant to high school and college calculus, that were grounded in research from the learning sciences; \nCreating flipped instruction lessons with videos and online assignments to provide more time for in-class exploration; \nIteratively refining modules and lessons based on outcomes from external evaluations, feedback from stakeholders and other faculty, and witnessed implementations;\nIncluding undergraduate students in module creation to improve the likelihood freshmen would find the modules accessible and engaging, and\nProviding module facilitators (e.g., graduate students) with professional development and ongoing support.\n\n\nOn both formative and summative evaluation methods, students regularly reacted positively to the engineering modules. They commented on how the modules improved their learning, their interest and motivation, and their understanding of how engineering is connected to calculus. On post-survey items evaluating student perceptions of the modules and their impacts, the majority of students indicated:\n\nThe modules were valuable activities and deepened their understanding of calculus;\nMath was more relevant and interesting because of the engineering modules;\nThey understood topics coupled with the modules better than those without modules;\nThe modules helped them see how math is used in engineering; and\nThe modules strengthened their commitment to pursue an engineering degree.\n\n\nThe results of most quantitative analyses, where students rated their interest and attitudes toward engineering at the beginning and end of courses in which the modules were implemented, were not statistically significant. This may indicate that the modules neither improved nor hurt the students in terms of their engineering interest, motivation, or persistence. It may also indicate the variables measured were not appropriate for the entire sample, measures used were insufficient for detecting change, or there were too many confounding factors of which the evaluation team and stakeholders were unaware.\n\nStudent retention in engineering increased over the life of the project, however, the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas implemented multiple measures to improve retention over the life of the project.  It was not possible to attribute the portion of the increased retention that was due solely to the impact of the modules.\n\n  \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David T Allen"
