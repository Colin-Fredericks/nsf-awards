 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop novel electric-field-controlled magnetic memory devices, where switching of the nonvolatile memory bits is performed by voltages (i.e. electric fields), rather than spin-polarized currents or magnetic fields, for extremely low energy dissipation applications.   These memory devices will be used in a Magnetoelectric Random Access Memory (MeRAM), providing significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency (up to 100x), density (up to 10x), and scalability (down to <10nm) compared to state-of-the-art magnetic memories (MRAM) such as spin transfer torque (STT-MRAM). The improved energy efficiency results from the suppression of Ohmic losses (heating) since no currents are used. This project will focus on development and optimization of magnetic bit designs for MeRAM. Their performance will be tested and compared to identify the most promising candidates for product development. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in the broad area of advanced low-power electronics. In particular, the high memory density allows for MeRAM to be used as a nonvolatile alternative to replace dynamic random access memory (DRAM, a $37B market), making it nonvolatile and improving its speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, the excellent energy efficiency of MeRAM allows it to be integrated with CMOS, potentially resulting in revolutionary new applications in ultralow-power logic for mobile systems on chip (SoC). This will result in instant-on nonvolatile electronics, which can be powered on/off instantaneously without the loss of information. It allows for an entirely new user experience where traditional boot-up and shut-down times are eliminated, and provides energy savings by eliminating standby power, representing a new paradigm in electronics. MeRAM is the only nonvolatile memory technology that meets all the requirements for such applications.",

Superior performance and economic viability are now associated with the delivery of applications and services directly from the cloud, with ever-increasing demands on the underlying technologies used to store the information.  This trend is unsustainable with existing memory technologies.  On the long term, \"memories for big data\" require radically lower power consumption, higher speed, lower cost per bit, higher density, high reliability, and better scalability to ensure cost-effective storage and reliable retrieval of massive data over the next few decades.  This changing landscape of the data industry offers a major potential for emerging memory technologies that can successfully address these new emerging demands.
