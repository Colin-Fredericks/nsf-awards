 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following injury to the nervous system, the damaged tissue must be replenished with new cells, and the damaged neuronal connections must be re-wired properly for the original function to be restored.  Most adult vertebrates show little if any regeneration after damage to the central nervous system. However, other animal groups, specifically echinoderms, provide excellent examples of fast and complete nervous system regeneration.  This research makes use of a novel echinoderm model organism, the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima that can regenerate their central nervous components following transection.  This project studies the cellular and molecular events that take place in order to undergo successful neural repair. Specifically the contributions of cell death and cell proliferation to central nervous system regeneration and the possible role of several genes that are highly expressed during neural regeneration will be analyzed.  The results will correlate the expression of regeneration-associated genes to the cells and/or processes where they are involved and will help elucidate their possible function. \r\n\r\nThis project provides \"hands-on\" research training to underrepresented Hispanic students at various levels, from high-school to doctoral.  Students will be exposed to competitive research in the field of neural plasticity, an area of research that has an increasingly high profile and that serves to attract students with various interests.  Moreover, the research outreach will extend to science teachers and the general public via web page information, press releases and interviews. Finally, the findings from these experiments explore basic components of regenerative processes that can be used to understand the regenerative limitations in other animal groups, including humans, and that in the future could constitute the basis for applications in biotechnology and medicine.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEchinoderms, such as starfish, have amazing regenerative capacities.  We have used another echinoderm species, a sea cucumber of the species Holothuria glaberrima to study the process of nervous regeneration.  Our results have shown that support cells named radial glia cells, play a key role in the regeneration that follows transection of their nerve cord.  These cell undergo a dedifferentiation process, migrate and give rise to both neurons and glia of the regenerated nerve segment. It is interesting that the radial glia cell type is similar to cells that play a vital role during the development of the vertebrate embryonic nervous system.  We have also described the genes that might be involved in this regenerative process.  Activation of certain genes associated with cells acquiring the potential to become other cell types was observed, in particular the activation of a gene named myc.  We have also developed tools to show that in the event that this gene is downregulated, nervous system regeneration is slowed down.  Our findings have also greatly extended what is known about the echinoderm nervous system.  We have shown that new neurons are continuously formed in adult echinoderms nervous system, a process that greatly differs from most higher vertebrates where only certain regions of the central nervous system have neurogenic capacity.  Cell and fiber types within the main nervous system have been described as well as the nerve components of the digestive tract.  In addition, the regeneration of the neurons and fibers of the intestine were described.\n\nFinally, graduate and undergraduate students participated in the research sponsored by the grant.  These students were trained in cellular and molecular manipulations and techniques.  Many of these students completed their bachelor degree and continued into graduate, medical or pharmacy schools. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jose E Garcia-Arraras"
