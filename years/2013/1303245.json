The main topics of research are on restriction theorems, zero free region for Rankin-Selberg L-functions and equidistributions of horospheres on higher rank groups.\r\n\r\n\t The projects that the PI pursues not only have fundamental theoretical values, but also have important applications.  The research will provide new bridges among analytic number theory, representation theory and ergodic theory.  This introduces interesting subjects for experts in different fields. One would hope the interaction of these three different fields would produce fruitful results in the future.",
