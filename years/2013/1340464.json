The heightened public awareness\r\nof adulterated and contaminated food products has brought increased pressure on governments,\r\nhealth organizations, industry and agriculture from around the world to combat these problems\r\nand ensure the safety and authenticity of our food supply. We propose to convene a symposium\r\non Biosensors for Agriculture to address sensor technologies to confront these issues. The\r\nsymposium will be held in conjunction with the Electrochemical Society?s annual fall meeting\r\nin San Francisco. This one day symposium will consist of 1) Invited Presentations describing\r\nrecent sensor research and organizational roadmaps; 2) a Panel Discussion session to identify\r\ntechnology gaps not being addressed by current efforts; 2) an open forum Research Poster Session;\r\nand 4) a Poster Contest to encourage student research on biosensors. This symposium will lead\r\nto innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure food safety for consumers.",
