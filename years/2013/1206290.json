 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for meetings of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held during 2013-2015 at Portland State University, Stanford University, the University of Oregon Eugene, and the University of Washington Seattle. The first meeting is on May 11-12, 2013 at Portland State University. Invited research talks by leading experts in differential geometry, geometric analysis, symplectic and contact geometry are complemented by discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants assess the state of various areas in geometry, and highlight open problems in these areas. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of very active researchers in geometry scattered throughout the various universities which are involved in the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar. These periodic meetings bring these researchers together for consultation, collaboration, and stimulation of new ideas. A significant number of research programs have been initiated as a result of interactions at these meetings. The PNGS is especially valuable for graduate students in geometry at the various participating universities which have small geometry groups. The PNGS meetings give these students an excellent opportunity to see the broader picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also very valuable for the growing number of geometers working at some of the smaller universities in the region, such as Pacific University, Lewis and Clark, Seattle University, and Idaho State. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the conference website located at www.math.washington.edu/~lee/PNGS",
