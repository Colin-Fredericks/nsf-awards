 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the University of Maine at Machias (the easternmost of the seven campuses in the University of Maine System) examines opportunities to create new marine aquaculture jobs and new wealth in east coastal Maine through shellfish research involving two commercially important species: blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Arctic surfclams (Mactromeris polynyma). Currently, mussels are cultured using juveniles sourced from the wild where spatial and temporal variation in both biotic and abiotic conditions does not allow for consistent annual production schedules. Surfclams are not cultured anywhere at present, and, although present in the Gulf of Maine, are harvested commercially only in the Canadian Maritimes where they are dredged hydraulically at depths greater than 20 meters. The surfclams are flash frozen and only their feet are marketed. The proposed activities advance knowledge and understanding within the field of shellfish aquaculture involving the hatchery, nursery, and growout phases of these two commercial bivalve species that have yet to be produced in shellfish hatcheries in the U.S. The research effort will yield information critical to other researchers and commercial businesses about the parameters that affect growth and survival of each species from early to later life-history stages.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are related to increasing U.S. competitiveness in the seafood industry. For example, since 1990, U.S. mussel imports have increased from 2,600 tons to more than 15,000 tons. Over 90% of the imports come from two countries, New Zealand and Canada, because the domestic supply is inadequate to keep up with consumer demand. Other impacts involve mentoring undergraduate students in teaching, training, and learning through hands-on hatchery and field-based activities that will broaden participation of underrepresented groups (academic and geographic). The academic-small business partnership is fundamental to the shellfish research that creates a stronger, more efficient research infrastructure. As configured, this partnerships will lead to commercialization activities that are sustainable and compatible with the cultural heritage and ecological values of downeast Maine. PI Beal (a Fulbright Scholar) and co-PI Shumway (an Aldo Leopold Fellow) have extensive experience bridging the gap between industry and academia and will be active in the project as well as in outreach activities.\r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution, University of Maine at Machias, a public, undergraduate institution of 1,000 students and 100 employees in eastern Maine; and three primary, small technology-based business partners: AC,  Inc (Beals, ME), the largest wholesale seafood business in eastern Maine with 23 employees; New DHC Inc. (Machiasport, ME), a salmon aquaculture company in eastern Maine with 55 employees; and, Pemaquid Oyster Company, Inc. (Waldoboro, ME), a shellfish aquaculture company with 6 employees. Other academic and governmental partners include the University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences (Avery Point, CT);  Two branches of National Oceanic and Atmoshperic Administration (NOAA): National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Milford, CT; and National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in Charleston, SC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe award focused on both laboratory- and field-based research to examine the potential for culturing two commercial bivalve species:  the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Arctic surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma).  The effort examined the hatchery, nursery, and growout phases of both species in eastern Maine, USA (2013-2015). \n\nMussels are farmed along the Maine coast, and landings in 2015 generated $2.4 million in dockside revenues.  The seed (small juveniles) that ultimately grow to become the adult mussels that are consumed in restaurants and other dining establishments are captured and collected by suspending ropes from floating work platforms with the hope that swimming, microscopic wild mussel larvae find the ropes and settle onto them.  This practice yields high spatial and temporal variation in wild seed numbers, and can only occur when mussels reproduce, which is generally over a short time during spring.  We examined methods in a hatchery setting to produce cultured seed year-round from wild-caught mussel adults and succeeded in all but two months (October and November).  We investigated a variety of microalgal diets on the growth and survival of mussel larvae and juveniles and found that mixed diets consisting of single-celled and small-chain diatoms, haptophytes, and cryptophytes work best.  Also, when larvae transition from the plankton onto ropes or other collector materials that surfaces with the highest structural complexity/greatest surface area elicit the strongest settlement responses.  In the field, cultured mussel juveniles that were attached to ropes suspended vertically in the water column grew fastest between June and August, and became larger more quickly at 5 m vs. 2 m depths.  With time and increasing size, juvenile mussels tended to drop/fall off ropes due to an apparent negative response to high intraspecific densities.  These mussels are lost to any commercial endeavor because they end up on the seafloor where they become prey to lobsters, crabs, and bottom-feeding fish.  The effect of that behavior was minimized by surrounding ropes with small-aperture, flow-through mesh or placing ropes inside small-mesh bags that caught the falling mussels. \n\nArctic surfclams occur along the east coast of North America from Rhode Island to Labrador.  They are not farmed (yet), and are not commercially harvested along the Maine coast due to lack of supply, but are harvested from sandy and muddy-sand bottoms in deep water (20-50 m) in Atlantic Canada where they support a $50 million industry.  They are prized for their purple-colored foot that turns a brilliant orange/reddish color when the animal is processed or cooked.  Although most of the Canadian product fills niche markets in Asian where the foot is used as sushi or sashimi, we conducted a study to assess the market potential for Maine-grown whole Arctic surfclams (1.5- to 2-inches in shell length, SL).   Results of that assessment indicate that there is good potential to sell this size surfclam to restaurants and wholesalers in Maine at a relatively high price.  This was the first-ever attempt to complete the life-cycle of this species in a culture setting.  Larvae were reared from both wild and cultured broodstock during the grant period, and juveniles grew best in submerged, field-based nurseries from 3-12 mm SL during summer months when seawater temperatures ranged between 12-15oC. Cultured juveniles grew and survived well in nursery units without sediments.  Field experiments conducted in the lower intertidal in both sandy and muddy habitats that used animals smaller than 12 mm SL were not successful (survival rates &lt; 5% in plots designed to deter predators with small-mesh netting).  Surfclams &gt; 12 mm SL grew to 38-50 mm (1.5-2-inches) in two years in both habitats. Surfclam larvae and juveniles did not retain saxitoxin from toxic dinoflagellates for extended periods of time in the lab, suggesting that this species is an excellent culture cand..."
