 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale Internet testbeds such as PlanetLab and GENI are widely used by the academic community. Unfortunately, wireless infrastructure to support wireless networking systems research is not as prevalent. Projects such as Orbit and GENI/WiMAX provide a valuable service framework, but these wireless testbeds are limited in scale in terms of geographic footprint as well as in terms of diversity of radio access and device technology. Not only the networking community but also application domain specific research communities such as environmental sensing and intelligent transportation systems require wireless cyberinfrastructure.  Currently the effort required to design and deploy wireless infrastructure to support such research 'in the wild' imposes a significant burden on projects.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project builds and trials a nationwide wireless network that supports the academic research community called the network the Science Wireless Network or SciWiNet. SciWiNet is based on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) model: SciWiNet (a collaboration between Clemson University and Rutgers University) represents the Service Operator; the operator of the NVMO infrastructure represents the Carrier of Record and FCC license holder; the Wireless Network Operator (WNO)owns the underlying spectrum and network infrastructure. The underlying infrastructure  is not under investigation. Instead, this project is developing and evaluating a possible service framework that can support a broad set of academic researchers and which can integrate campus-provided wireless infrastructure. More specifically, the objectives of this project are to: \r\n1. Evaluate the efficacy of an MVNO model to provide a wireless testbed for the academic research community; \r\n2. Integrate and build upon innovations and resources made available from the GENI community; \r\n3. Develop appropriate support for the community of SciWiNet users that are from outside the networking research community; \r\n4. Identify viable paths by which SciWiNet can evolve to become a self-sustaining, national resource.\r\n\r\nThis project will enable research that currently not feasible because of the limited coverage of existing GENI/WiMax base stations, including research in areas such as eHealth, intelligent transportation systems, smart buildings and structures, homeland security, and Internet of Things.   It is expected that the combination of campus provided wireless access and the NVMO will facilitate development and deployment of new applications and will be instrumental in educating students to consider the combination of theory and practice in complex heterogeneous wireless systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Science Wireless Network, or SciWiNet, is experimental infrastructure that was developed and trialed as a part of a collaborative, exploratory NSF project awarded to Clemson University and to Rutgers University.  The project started in August 2013 and ended in December 2016.  The project team, which included Sprint and Arterra,  formed and operated a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO).  SciWiNet services, primarily access to Sprint?s data network which includes a management portal allowing researchers to manage traffic across the set of devices, targeted users in the wireless networking research community. The intent of the project was to assess the community requirements of a large scale cellular data network. Of particular interest was to explore the design space available to an MVNO. The results of the exploratory project could be used in a future proposal to that would fully fund the endeaver.   \n\nProject outcomes that are broadly impactful derive from the project?s community outreach activities related to wireless broadband mapping and engagement with undergraduate students.  Project outcomes that address the core research issues derive primarily from feedback from SciWiNet?s trial participants. The first year of the project focused on getting the network operational.  Once operational, targeted researchers were invited to trial the network.  In the second year, we opened the network to the GENI community.  During peak time periods, we would see 30 or more active devices on the network.   Feedback was obtained through an online survey involving thirty-six researchers representing 20 different universities.  Most of the survey participants were also involved in the trial of SciWiNet.  The questions were designed to learn current wireless needs, to obtain feedback specific to the SciWiNet trial, and to obtain feedback related to several ideas for long term sustainability.  Highlights from the feedback include the following:\n\nUsage of wireless for research and education:  82% WiFi, 50%  50% Cellular data 3G/4G service\nCurrent devices: 70% Android, 36% iPhone, 33% embedded/custom, 50% use more than 2 devices\nProject duration requiring active devices: mean/median:  3.17/3.0 months,  44% &lt;= 1month, expected usage for future projects will be greater than current usage\nCurrent data consumption:  mean/median:  118/2 GBytes, expected usage in future similar \nBiggest complaint with current wireless:  Only answer that was observed &gt;3 times was related to poor coverage, high data costs, or limited plan flexibility.\nSustainability plan options for SciWiNet: 61% for a model that offers reduced wireless access cost if added to research proposal budgets; 42% for a model that offers reduced wireless access cost if agree to contribute devices to a 'shared' pool of devices managed by SciWiNet; 38% for a model that offers reduced wireless access cost if devices can be used by other researchers while in use by your project.\n\n \n\nOur findings suggest that the infrastructure required by the wireless research community includes : 1)customized cellular devices; 2)access to internal wireless information (from the base stations); 3)control of wireless network at least to support experimentation.   While an MVNO could provide access to  monitor and manage the traffic of its customers,  it would take much larger number of customers to obtain the lowest cost wireless access rates and to obtain the attention of Sprint to do anything that they do not already make available to any other of their MVNO customers.  Perhaps the main outcome of this project is the negative result that  an MVNO, based on the information obtained in the 2014-2015 timeframe from Arterra and Sprint, does not provide the level of configurability and accessibility a cellular network required by the wireless network research community.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James J Martin"
