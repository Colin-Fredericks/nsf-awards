 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop DNA nanostructures that can self-assemble into larger one dimensional and two dimensional arrays capable of programmable self-replication and programmable origami folding into complex, predictable three dimensional shapes.  The resulting nanostructured origami will organize embedded non-DNA components into intricate geometries that enable new material properties and device functionalities. This project brings together a team of leading experts and practitioners from the sciences, mathematics, and sculptural arts who will draw upon their diverse expertise and inspirations to tackle collaboratively the technical challenges from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.  The project is also educating a new generation of scientists and students capable of developing new paradigms for functional nanomaterial and communicating the excitement and possibilities of these results to the public at large.\r\n\t\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this project will be to enable the easy and economical self-replication of complex three dimensional nanostructures using mass produced components, through our progress in meeting the challenges of preparing the difficult original template structures. Self-replication will also facilitate the evolution of better materials or devices from generation to generation.  Thus, in the long term, a research group may develop a DNA-organized optical metamaterial, and then  immediately obtain large quantities of the prototype by introducing the initial template into a vat of components routinely ordered from a general foundry; similarly, a medical team may be able to create a complex immunotherapeutic vaccine by evolving a DNA nanostructure which displays a variety of antigens and adjuvants in some optimal, but initially unknown, three dimensional configuration; in the same vein, an environmental cleanup crew may be able to produce rapidly large quantities of a nanodevice tailored for breaking down different water borne pollutants via the solar powered activity of multiple enzymes clustered around light harvesting complexes.  Thus, the capabilities we are developing will facilitate previously unimagined methodologies in the production of useful and valuable new materials.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.",

Seeman and Canary demonstrated that an organic semiconductor could be organized into a 3D crystal and constructed a DNA origami-based electro-optical modulator.  A key development is that such insoluble molecules as organic semiconductors can be solubilized by the attachming DNA strands to their ends.  Seeman and Ellis-Monaghan groups worked out a design formalism for DNA Skeletons, and for scaffolding strand design tools.  Seeman and Chaikin groups collaborated extensively, including working out higher resolution crystals of self-assembled DNA by modifying their sticky ends.  In addition, the Seeman group produced litters of cross-tile origami tiles, chiral colloidal arrangements, and demonstrated sequential self-assembly of DNA-modified droplets.

In addition to the theoretical work with the Ellis-Monaghan group, the Seeman group also collaborated with Nils Baas of Trongheim on the construction of topological links.  They have built a nanomechanical device that works within a 3D crystal.  They also functionalized self-assembled 3D DNA crystals with triple helices.  Seeman built a system to monitor the growth of self-assembled crystals by time-lapse photography.  In addition, Seeman used the tensegrity triangle motif within 3D crystals to gain a 5 &Aring; image of torsionally stressed DNA.  Finally, Seeman developed a signal-passing mechanism for strand exchange that can be used to control the growth of an array.\n\nThe Saint Michael?s group collaborated with the partner labs to devise design strategies for targeted constructs and developed mathematical theory to support future applications. Significant results included determining NP-Hardness for three common design strategies, thus confirming the difficulty of the design problems. She countered this with explicit designs for common targets and with algorithms and software for tractable situations.

These students participated in both the theoretical (mathematical) and pragmatic (implementation) aspects of developing graph theoretical models for various problems arising from applications in self-assembling nanostructures.\n\nFor biological applications, the Goddard and Rossi groups developed a new type of molecular scale logic switch that can regulate gene expression in human cells according to \"if : then\" based logic rules.  These \"conditional small interfering RNAs (Cond-siRNA)\" form the basis for developing revolutionary new drugs whose molecules can tailor their own drug effects to the biological activities occurring within individual cells in the body.  In collaboration with partners at other institutions, Goddard and Rossi are in the process of starting a venture backed company to take this exciting technology into the clinic.  These advances have been fundamentally enabled by rational design of nanostructures using molecular modeling and simulations conducted in the Goddard lab at Caltech. \n\nIn addition to these scientific achievements, the ODISSEI project played an essential role in the PhD students and postdocs.  This included undergraduates that participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program at Caltech.\n\nNumerous summer undergraduate and high school students at Caltech and City of Hope have played important, direct roles in the development of Cond-siRNA technology.
