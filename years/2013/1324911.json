 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study evaluates changes in Calcium (Ca) cycling at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire based on measurements of Ca stable isotope ratios on a unique sample archive dating to as early as 1963. Like other Northeast U.S. forests, the Ca cycle was significantly perturbed by acid deposition beginning in the early 1950's resulting in increased Ca loss from bio-available soil pools and detrimental effects on forest growth. Additionally, several of the first order watersheds at HBEF have been experimentally logged allowing examination of the relationship between harvesting, Ca cycling and forest ecology.  Research will address the following questions: How do the Ca isotope ratios of streamwater and soil change in response to disturbances including acidification and deforestation? What can such data tell us about the mechanisms of Ca loss from forest ecosystems and changes in Ca cycling resulting from disturbance? An isotope-tracer box model indicates that soil and streamwater Ca isotopes reflect the relative magnitudes of important fluxes in the forest Ca cycle (external supply, plant uptake, and recycling to soil), leading to a series of testable hypotheses related to the ecosystem-level response to these perturbations.  The main hypothesis is that forest growth will take up Ca, limiting it's input to streamwater, while deforestation will increase streamwater Ca as runoff from soil.  To address questions and hypotheses, Ca isotope ratios and elemental concentrations will be determined on a carefully selected group of archived soil parent material, precipitation, streamwater, soil, and vegetation samples.\r\n\r\nCa biogeochemistry has important implications for forest sustainability, both in the NE US, Northern Europe, and China. Ca isotopes, like other tracers of Ca cycling, has the potential to resolve some of the uncertainties in the sources of Ca loss from forests that are not apparent from mass balance studies alone. This information is important beyond biogeochemical research, with implications for forest management and regionally important agribusiness, such as maple syrup production.  This project will primarily support a graduate student in Boston University's new Terrestrial Biogeosciences PhD program. The  graduate student and the PI will create modules for use by a future year's cohort of GLACIER graduate students that introduce middle school students to New England biogeochemistry, acid rain, and forest sustainability. The results of this project will further be communicated to the about 300 students at Boston University and Tufts that the PI teaches annually.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was aimed at the development of a new tool to investigate how the nutrient element calcium is taken up from soil into trees, recycled back into soil, and ultimately exported from the forest dissolved in streamwater.  Calcium is particularly important in forests in the Northeast United States, because deposition of acid rain in past decades resulted in significant loss of calcium from forest soils.  Trees that grow without adequate supply of calcium from soils show decreased tolerance to cold and increased susceptibility to disease.  Sugar maples, an important economic resource in the Northeast US, are particularly vulnerable to low calcium stocks. \n\nOur study took place at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, an important site for research on nutrient behavior in forest ecosystems for decades.  A small watershed at Hubbard Brook was clearcut in the 1980?s using commercial logging techniques to evaluate the impact of such logging on soil nutrient stocks.  Work at the time showed significant losses of calcium from the ecosystem, but the details and mechanisms for this loss were poorly understood. \n\nWater, soil, and vegetation samples collected as part of this decades-old study and archived on site at Hubbard Brook were made available for use in this project.  We applied an emerging analytical technique (calcium stable isotope mass spectrometry) that involves not only measuring the concentration of calcium in forest soils, streamwater, and vegetation, but the isotope ratios of calcium, that is, the relative amounts of the naturally occurring light and heavy atoms of calcium.  The isotope ratios allow researchers to distinguish calcium that weathers from bedrock from calcium that has been cycled through trees.  Our work showed that the enhanced loss of calcium from the Hubbard Brook forest in response to clearcutting was calcium that had been cycled through trees and redeposited in soils.  This allowed us to falsify other hypotheses, such as accelerated chemical weathering of underlying bedrock. This calcium isotope approach has applicability to forested ecosystems elsewhere, and to other problems in Earth and Ocean Sciences.\n\nThe project supported the PhD research of Boston University student Ken Takagi, who now works in the environmental remediation sector in New York City.  It further supported three Boston University undergraduate researchers, who learned to conduct analyses on sophisticated analytical instrumentation and to interpret primary data.  Two of these students are now pursuing PhD?s at other US institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew C Kurtz"
