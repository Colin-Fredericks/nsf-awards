 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a study of brightness variations in cataclysmic variables (CVs) seen in data from the Kepler satellite.  Cataclysmic variables are binary stars in which material is flowing from an evolved companion onto a white dwarf; the flow contributes to the maintenance of an accretion disk around the white dwarf.  The Kepler data has unprecedented time sampling and span, which should reveal brightness variations on many different time scales.  The major components of the project are (1) to convert a public domain general purpose hydrodynamical code to an accretion disk simulation code, which will be distributed to the astronomical community; (2) to model the complexity of brightness variations as indicators of the nature of the plasma flow; and (3) to accurately model the radiation hydrodynamics and emergent spectral energy distribution of CV accretion. \r\n\r\nThe work is expected to improve the understanding of gaseous flow around compact objects, which in turn will she light on many astrophysical phenomena including the production of supernovae.  The public release of numerical codes will aid future research in CVs and other areas of study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original NASA Kepler mission field of view included some 40 known cataclysmic variable (CV) binary stars and has returned 4 years of data from these stars of unprecedented quality and quantity. The data have already provided a deeper understanding of the nature of dwarf nova outbursts and\nsuperoutbursts, as well as some unexpected surprises. It is no\nexaggeration to say that the information contained within these data\nhave been transformational in terms of our understanding of the physics\nof accretion disks and the fundamental nature of astrophysical plasma\nviscosity.  Using the Kepler time series from the systems in the field as precision templates against which to judge the quality of numerical simulations, the proposal team believed that their work would substantially improve our understanding of the fundamental dynamics and underlying\nmicrophysics (viscosity) of outburst and superoutburst events, as well\nas positive and negative superhumps.  \n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThrough the analysis of the Kepler data, the PI and collaborators found that the photometric signal in CVs that results from the retrograde precession of a tilted accretion disk varies as a direct result of the changing radial mass distribution in the disk resulting from the interplay of accretion and outburst events.  These results promise to provide a probe of the nature of astrophysical viscosity.  In a series of publications, the PI and collaborators also were able to explore the behavior of a number of individual CVs.\n\nThe PI and one of his Ph.D. students demonstrated that a magnetic field on the primary white dwarf in a CV can provide the torque needed to tilt an accretion disk out of the orbital plane, answering a long-standing question as to the source of the disk tilt.\n\nThe PI and his postdoc Dr. Seung-Hoon Cha worked to produce a next-generation accretion disk modeling code that implemented the Gudunov technique into the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method.  This aspect of the project proved to be more difficult than anticipated.  A smoothed particle hydrodynamics accretion diskk modeling code was released to the public domain through submission to the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ascl:1305.011). \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nA number of undergraduate and graduate students participated in the project, as well as a postdoc.  Two students working in the area of astrophysical hydrodynamics earned their Ph.D. degrees.  The released code will be useful to other researchers in the field, and will be straightforward for others to modify and adapt to their specific purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Wood"
