Three organizations - TERC, the University of California-Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, and the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center - will collaborate to explore and codify practices that enhance the success of efforts to design K-12 science curriculum materials for large-scale implementation. Investigators from these three organizations will conduct and synthesize results from a series of retrospective and live-design practice, broad and 'deep dive' studies, with the goal of articulating a conceptual model of educational design for large-scale use. Of particular concern are the processes and strategies designers employ to address key challenges to producing curricular materials capable of having meaningful impacts on large numbers of learners (e.g., to achieve deep understanding and rich performance, to connect to and leverage diverse social and cultural experiences, and to facilitate implementation in diverse and resource-limited settings). These issues will be explored from a variety of perspectives, including: interviews with designers and document reviews to identify structural project characteristics that appear to be empirically associated with scaling success; retrospective case studies to identify salient features and lessons learned from more and less successful large-scale design initiatives for science education; and deep dives (involving participant-observation, interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis) into sustained design practices over an extended period to explore how design teams address key design challenges while developing educational materials for large-scale use.",

These changes have consequences for both student and teacher learning.  Statistical analyses revealed that teacher supports, rather than student supports, had positive impacts on both student and teacher outcomes. Specifically, positive student outcomes were associated with curriculum materials with a larger scope and with materials that provide teachers with information about students? ideas and recommended instructional strategies.

Our research examining trends in curriculum design helps the field understand how the characteristics of different curriculum materials can shape outcomes for students and teachers.   Our in-depth work examining curriculum design processes will help designers create curriculum materials likely to have lasting impact, by providing guidelines to help new designers engage in the type of iterative work required to design curriculum for scale.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer L Russell"
