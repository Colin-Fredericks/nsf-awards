 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Targeted Infusion Project at Howard University will address the challenge of increasing the number of African-American undergraduates in computer science by establishing a multi-layered program that includes a partnership with Google, Inc. The project includes: a virtual pre-college program for incoming freshmen; a revised and restructured Computer Science course curriculum that includes culturally-relevant content; Googler co-instructors and guest speakers for introductory Computer Science courses; a mentoring program pairing freshmen with Googlers; a Computer Science boot-camp for peer-led tutoring targeting introductory Computer Science courses; faculty professional development; and undergraduate research opportunities in Computer Science. Project activities will provide student participants with a better understanding of Computer Science and the broad opportunities available within the field. Students will establish support systems that include industry mentors, department faculty, and peers to help them not only persist, but succeed in Computer Science. The enhanced curriculum will also help students develop critical thinking skills, including problem solving, algorithm development, and higher-level programming.\r\n\r\nThis project will increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in Computer Science and enhance the educational infrastructure at Howard University. Additionally, the project will directly impact fifteen pre-service teachers and enhance the preparation of future K-12 teachers. The project can serve as a model for Computer Science departments, particularly those at other Historically Black Colleges and Universities that share similar challenges with student enrollment, engagement, and retention. Findings will be broadly disseminated increasing Computer Science literacy.",
