 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of social science?s greatest theoretical puzzles is ?What factors lead individuals to join together collectively to protect a public good, when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk, or otherwise act opportunistically??  We examine this question in a study of poor, rural, indigenous communities to understand how they overcome socioeconomic and geographic barriers to launch new forms of social movements relying on Western science and international collaboration.  In contrast to arguments that environmental issues concern only the relatively affluent, we argue that immediate threats to community livelihoods may provide material incentives for poor communities to come together to mitigate environmental impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe project evaluates determinants of collective action at the individual, community, and transnational levels using survey research in Ecuador, interviews in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Brazil, and archival research at the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.  Understanding changes in indigenous movement strategies - from confrontation to cooperation with government authorities and scientists - should help communities and policymakers better cope with environmental threats.  The project will also help us understand how indigenous leaders draw attention to scarcities they face, while using the climate change frame to help pressure international organizations and governments regarding one of the most vital issues of our time.  Indeed, this project explains how small and apparently powerless groups largely outside of the Western system of justice can leverage judicial institutions to challenge powerful global energy interests.  Finally, the project will train graduate students in Ecuador and the United States, help Ecuadorian scientists launch a social science component to environmental studies in one of Ecuador?s premier universities, and disseminate findings among academics and practitioners.",
