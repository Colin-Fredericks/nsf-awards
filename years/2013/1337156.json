 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Madison is acquiring a modern Electron Microprobe (EMP) to replace a worn 21-year-old instrument. It is the only EMP in Wisconsin and is heavily used by many NSF-funded researchers. No other technique matches the versatility or accuracy for in situ chemical analysis of major to trace elements at the micron-scale. It is non-destructive, permitting chemical data to be correlated with other forms of analysis. A modern EMP will also have new capabilities including enhanced imaging and a more intense LaB6 source that will permit sub-micron analysis. The new capabilities and enhanced reliability of a modern EMP are required by over 116 currently funded federal (74 NSF) grants, valued at $18M in Geoscience (64 federal grants, 47 NSF), >$30M in Materials Science (30 federal grants, 14 NSF) and $19M (22 federal grants, 13 NSF) in other departments (Chemistry, Physics, Limnology, Soils, Pharmacy). Projects supported by NSF-EAR include many studies of deep-crustal processes: petrogenesis of magmatic systems, causes of explosive volcanic eruptions, conditions of granulite and of eclogite facies metamorphism, the genesis of economic deposits of metals and fossil fuels, tectonics of major shear zones, Hadean zircons, and meteoritics. Studies of near surface processes include: astrobiology, paleoclimatology (biogenic carbonates and foraminifera, speleothems), diagenesis and basin evolution, cementation in shallow fault zones, and nano-minerals. In Materials Science, projects include synthesis of new materials and advanced processing methods for materials for new electronic, magnetic and optical devices, renewable energy materials/processes, and high temperature structures. The capabilities of the UW-Madison EMP complement and are essential to the operation of WiscSIMS, an NSF-supported National Facility at UW-Madison for in situ analysis of stable isotope geochemistry. \r\n\r\nThe ability of the EMP Lab at UW-Madison to build on its 47-year record of education, service and research in the public interest will be enhanced by acquisition of a modern electron microprobe. PI and Lab Director Dr. John Fournelle has for over 20 years contributed to advancing the science of electron microprobe analysis. The research that will be facilitated by a modern EMP will address many problems of societal concern, including: paleoclimate, development of natural resources (oil, gas, water, metals, strategic elements), volcanic hazards, environmental remediation, and development of new materials with desirable properties such as electronics, refractories, and ceramics. Research conducted on our current instrument has resulted in > 650 publications. Learning to use the electron microprobe and to evaluate data is a key component to the educational development and maturing of students. Over the past 20 years, more than 200 graduate students in Geoscience and other STEM disciplines critical to our national economic competitiveness, including 66 women (49 in Geoscience) have used our EMP Lab for research. Geoscience faculty from smaller Wisconsin colleges bring their undergraduates to the Madison lab for their first experience running a microbeam analytical instrument.",

Electron microprobes focus electrons onto micron size objects inside a vacuum chamber and then measure the x-rays generated therein, permitting scientists, engineers and other researchers to understand the chemical composition of very small crystals, glasses, metals, ceramics and other materials. Sometimes these are geological, for example, from old volcanic ash, studied to evaluate probability of future volcanic eruptions. Or samples of rocks containing metal or rare earth ores being evaluated for commercial use. At other times they are manmade, such as studying experimental high-temperature alloys for engines or potential super-conductors for more efficient use of electricity in modern equipment. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Cameron Electron Microprobe Lab is the only facility in the state of Wisconsin with this instrument, and is open for use by students, faculty, staff of colleges and universities throughout Wisconsin and the midwest. Occasionally it is used by private inventors, and also by commercial firms evaluating new prospective materials. The specific model of instrument acquired here is the \"field emission\" electron source type, which produces at least a 10 times smaller diameter electron beam than the traditional tungsten wire source. This permits much sharper electron images; however, the purpose of the instrument is to do more than create pictures but rather using the x-rays generated to learn chemical composition. It is well known that the x-rays are generated within the sample from a larger \"interaction volume\", whose size is a product of both the material's density and composition, and the incident electron energy (usually in the range between 5000 and 30,000 electron volts). Traditionally, electron microprobes operate at 15,000-20,000 electron volts. However, the new instrument at UW-Madison is also involved in new \"low voltage\" research dropping the voltage down to 5,000-8,000 electron volts, to decrease the interaction volumes, to be able to study smaller objects down to 0.2-0.4 microns in size (from the normally doable 1-2 micron size). When this happens, however, 'normal' x-ray lines such as for iron (Fe K-alpha) no longer are excited by the lower energy electrons and a different iron x-ray, one from the weaker L family, must be used. As we have learned, however, there are many problems using iron L x-rays -- but using innovative approach, the UW lab has mastered a solution. This knowledge has been disseminated around the world both in publications and at conferences. Additionally, the UW lab is developing innovative hardware for the new electron microprobe, much of it focusing on the longstanding problem of carbon contamination of sample surfaces, which degrade low voltage operation. This includes using cryo-refrigerant cooling (replacing liquid nitrogen) for an anti-contamination plate, use of plasma cleaning, and installing of a residual gas analyzer to study the internal vacuum cleanliness.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;H&nbsp;Fournelle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1337156/1337156_10263973_1443552822565_LunarPacMan--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1337156/1337156_10263973_1443552822565_LunarPacMan--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rock fragment from M...",
