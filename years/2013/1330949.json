 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will leverage the advances we\r\nmade in fabricating flexible polymer surfaces that shed water at low tilt angles while remaining\r\nsuperhydrophobic after abrasion. In Phase I we developed a model which correlated surface\r\nmorphology with mechanical robustness. In Phase II we will apply this model to the\r\ndevelopment of a processes compatible with high speed, large-scale fabrication techniques.\r\nThe roofing industry seeks material that is self-cleaning, anti-fouling and is highly resistant to\r\nweather events over time. A durable, superhydrophobic polymeric roof membrane will meet\r\nthis market need. Commercial success depends on (1) qualifying production speeds up to 100\r\nfeet/min, (2) proving compliance to current product requirements and (3) showing value-add.\r\nPhase II studies will elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the stability of the surfaces\r\nwhen exposed to UV light, allowing us to improve weatherability. Having demonstrated the\r\nself-cleaning properties of our polymer surfaces in Phase I, we will focus on anti-fouling\r\nproperties in Phase II (i.e. low bacterial adhesion and reduced algae growth.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be twofold. Foremost, a direct impact will\r\nbe revenue and job growth in the US manufacturing sector. Secondarily, the technology will\r\nsupport federal policy goals on energy and the environment. Approximately $40 billion is spent\r\nannually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates,\r\nsubstituting a cool roof for a conventional roof can reduce carbon emissions which drive\r\nclimate change. Cool roofs also relieve strain on the electrical grid by reducing peak power\r\ndemand. Widespread use of cool roofs can improve air quality, hence human health, by\r\nslowing the formation of smog. Superhydrophobic polymer membranes fabricated using\r\ntechnology developed in this proposal will help keep roofs clean and better able to reflect heat.\r\nFurthermore, coating of outdoor infrastructure equipment, such as wind turbine blades and offshore\r\nenergy exploration platforms, will enable the safe operation of such facilities during icing\r\nconditions due to the ability of the superhydrophobic surface to prevent ice accretion. Field\r\ntests are underway. Food handling equipment will benefit from reduced adhesion of bacteria \r\nto surfaces, thus improving food safety.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nARL Designs LLC (ARLD) successfully achieved its main goal of demonstrating the economical production of robust superhydrophobic polymer coatings in large volumes and at low costs.   The control of the roughness of a surface was shown to strongly affect the interactions between water and the solid.  Based on the research conducted during this project, a multi-level hierarchical roughness was designed that minimized liquid-solid interactions, such that water forms nearly spherical droplets on the surface that easily roll-off at low tilt angles.  Such mobile droplets are highly effective at carrying away dirt particles, thus leaving the surface clean.  In addition, the hierarchical roughness was designed with length scales up to 100?s of microns, thereby creating a surface that is also highly resistant to abrasion.  Processes were developed to form this hierarchical roughness into a variety of thermoplastic polymers using commercially available equipment that is widely used in the polymer processing industry.   Moreover, the processes that were developed during this project eliminated the use of solvents, thereby further reducing costs as well as minimizing the environmental impact of the manufacturing process. Research and development efforts conducted during this project ultimately led to the production of continuous rolls of polymer substrates with superhydrophobic surfaces. \n\n \n\nARLD initially targeted the high reflectivity roofing membrane market for commercial buildings.  Approximately $40 billion is spent annually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates, substituting a highly reflective roof (also called a \"cool roof\") for a conventional roof can lower energy usage and so reduce carbon emissions which drive climate change.

Other applications for this technology include superhydrophobic dielectric insulators as well as anti-icing coatings for electrical distribution and transmission cables.\n\n \n\nDuring the course of the project, ARLD identified a new technology that could produce robust superhydrophobic coatings that are also optically transparent.  Once again, the research conducted demonstrated that producing a hierarchical roughness results in the creation of a surface that is non-wetting, i.e. a superhydrophobic surface on which droplets of water easily roll off the surface.  By reducing the length-scale of the roughness from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers, the optical properties of the surface were dramatically changed from one that effectively scatters visible light (thereby making the surface appear white) to one that is completely transparent to visible light.  Moreover, the hierarchical roughness creates a graded index of refraction; the index of the material gradually increases from the value of air to the value of the bulk polymer as the surface features merge from nano-fibrils (&lt;150 nm in length) into a continuous polymer coating.  Because of this gradual change in optical properties, more light is transmitted through the coated substrate and less light is reflected away.\n\n \n\nARLD recognized that a transparent superhydrophobic coating, using a low surface energy polymer, could provide the anti-reflective, anti-soiling and anti-icing properties that are needed to increase the electrical output of solar photo-voltaic (PV) panels.
