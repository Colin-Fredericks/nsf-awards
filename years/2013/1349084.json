 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to collect structural damage data that is caused by the EF5 tornado in the city of Moore, Oklahoma on May 20, 2013. The damage path of this tornado overlaps the damage paths of two previous tornadoes of 1999 and 2003. After the 1999 tornado several above ground safe rooms were constructed in residences. It would be beneficial to assess performance of safe rooms subjected to an extreme tornado. Even though there are close to 1,000 tornadoes recorded each year, less than 10 tornadoes are rated EF 4 and EF 5. When an EF5 tornado impacts a city there is a unique opportunity to document building damage and learn from the damage. This tornado damaged two schools, several commercial buildings, few safe rooms and hundreds of residential structures. RAPID funding provides an opportunity to document the damage before damaged buildings are cleared and the debris is moved.\r\n\r\nThe project team will work with other RAPID grantee teams in the field to improve coverage of the damage area and avoid duplication. The team of faculty members and students will travel to the damage site and document failure modes, materials of construction, location of structures with respect to the center of the path, and debris impacts for each documented structure. This team will document performance of safe rooms that are in the path of the tornado in addition to other damage. The RAPID teams will develop contour maps of EF ratings and wind speeds based on observed Degrees of Damage. These maps will be compared with past tornado studies to evaluate the similarities and differences. This comparison will contribute to the understanding of the spatial characteristics of tornado wind forces on structures. Building failure progression will be determined in different wind speed zones. The benefits and challenges of using social media (twitter) to improve disaster assessment will be determined.",

Until this EF5 tornado, springtime in Oklahoma had been relatively quiet, though Moore has been ravaged several times in recent years by tornado outbreaks.\n\nThe research team thoroughly canvassed the tornado path and assessed the condition of 75 residential shelters.\n\nThe fieldwork was augmented with the use of Twitter.  The research team used Twitter to identify content of interest and collect information.\n\nSome 16% of homes in Moore had shelters, and with only 16 minutes of warning, it was very surprising that there were so few fatalities.\n\nMany Moore residents without shelters still had access.  In Moore there is a remarkable informal neighborhood network where residents with shelters welcome others who are without.\n\nWhile considered economically unfeasible to use government funds to build residential shelters in every home, several federal and state programs have helped defray the costs.\n\nOklahoma is a place where government regulations rankle, and no state legislation has been proposed to mandate residential shelters.  A recent legislative movement in Moore was unsuccessful.  The tepid economy is also an issue, and nobody wants to reduce home affordability, even as shelters are known to be smart investments and raise property values in Oklahoma.\n\nThe great majority of shelters performed exceptionally in this tornado, even the unconventional designs.\n\nSeveral homes in Moore had aboveground safe rooms, but the majority of shelters were belowground.  Safe rooms in homes serve daily utility where belowground shelters are largely in disuse in calm times.\n\nThere are concerns with belowground shelters built in garages.  Quick access can be an issue if removal of a vehicle parked above is necessary.  Occupants can be trapped by home collapse, and flash floods and severed pipes can add to the dilemma.  Also, if left open, belowground shelters become hazards to emergency crews.\n\nAboveground shelters are exposed to tremendous wind loads and debris strikes.  The research team discovered an instance where debris missiles punctured a concrete safe room made with a waffle grid system.
