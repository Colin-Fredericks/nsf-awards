 "awd_abstract_narration": "Athletes playing well describe distortions in spatial perception:  basketball hoops appear as large as hula-hoops, golf holes as big as manholes, and baseballs as big as grapefruits. These subjective, anecdotal effects have been confirmed in experiments as psychological reality. However, they are not accounted for by current theories of perception, which consider optical cues and limited cognitive knowledge as the information for perception. In those theories, performance is thought to affect a post-perceptual process that generates the response rather than affecting perception itself. The aim of this proposal is to determine whether  the experience of a larger target when playing well reflects a perceptual or a post-perceptual effect and  to characterize the conditions under which action is most or least likely to influence perception.  \r\n\r\nAction-related factors, such as performance, influencing perception has important implications for our understanding of the perceptual process. In particular, it requires a functional approach in which perception provides information that  is beneficial for planning actions. Strategies could eventually be developed to exploit or compensate for differences in how individuals experience their environments. Such  strategies could elevate skilled performance, enhance rehabilitative strategies, and encourage more active behaviors in sedentary individuals. For example, if a goal is experienced as closer, an elderly or obese adult might be more willing to walk, thereby promoting a healthier lifestyle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCan action influence spatial perception?  When seeing the slant of hills, the distance to objects, and the size and speed of targets, are these perceptions influenced by the perceiver\u00c6s ability to act?  Research says yes, action can influence spatial perception.  This research assessed perception by measuring participants\u00c6 judgments of slant, distance, size, and speed, but these judgments could also reflect any number of post-perceptual processes such as response biases due to being in an experiment for which there can be pressures to respond in a certain way.  The purpose of the funded studies was to disentangle whether perception is prone to action-related biases or whether purported effects are due to non-perceptual influences. \n\nThis question is critical because it speaks to the fundamental nature of the mind.  It speaks to whether various cognitive processes operate independently or work with each other.  It speaks to whether people perceive the environment in a geometrically accurate way or whether people perceive the environment as it relates to the potential for action.  Answering the question is not straightforward, however, because scientists cannot measure perception directly.  Perception is an internal, private experience.  Instead, scientists must measure behaviors and make inferences about perception.  Given that these behaviors can be contaminated by non-perceptual processes, scientists must rely on strategies to disentangle perceptual effects from post-perceptual effects. \n\nThe funded studies used several of these strategies.  One strategy was to use indirect measures.  An indirect measure is when participants are asked about something other than the factor of interest.  For example, participants might be asked about perceived shape even though the experimenters are interested in perceived distance.  Another strategy has been to use action-based measures to assess perception.  Action-based measures have the advantage that they do not even require a judgment.  For example, instead of asking participants to verbally estimate the distance to targets in feet and inches, participants are instead asked to close their eyes and walk the specified extent.  This measure, known as blindwalking, measures perceived distance because if the target appears farther away, participants will walk farther.   A third strategy has been to explicitly measure the extent to which judgments are contaminated by response biases, and use statistics to factor out participants\u00c6 susceptibility to response biases.\n\nAll of these strategies reveal the same pattern: Action influences perception directly.  Action\u00c6s effect on perception was documented in a wide range of tasks.  For example, the ease with which a ball can be successfully blocked influences perceived speed of the ball. Objects that can be easily reached with a reach-extending tool look closer than when the tool is not used.  Distances up a steep hill appear farther away than the same extent on flat ground, presumably because of the increased effort required to walk up the hill.  Distances also appear farther to people who are older and to people who are obese and would have to exert more effort to walk the prescribed extent.\n\nThe funded studies have further advanced our understanding of the mind by determining novel factors that are influential for perception.  These factors include one\u00c6s potential for action, another person\u00c6s potential for action, and the threatening nature of the object.  Even though the environment\u00c6s spatial layout is the same, and so the optical information specifying this layout is the same, the environment can look different depending on a person\u00c6s ability to act. \n\nThe research involved educating 4 graduate students, and nearly 100 undergraduate students on how to conduct theoretically-inspired psychology research.  The findings were disseminated in scientific journals and in popular press media outlets including NPR, Scientific American, and the New York Time..."
