 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a popular approach that reveals internal structures of an object based on its shadows from an x-ray source.  Filling in the performance gap between light and electron microscopies, x-ray nano-CT depicts details as tiny as 50nm (\"resolution\") and has emerged as a powerful tool in various applications. However, a major barrier to realizing its full potential is the inaccuracy encountered when an internal region of interest (ROI) inside a large object is imaged only with x-rays through that region (\"the interior problem\"). Also, nano-CT demands an intensive x-ray beam that may damage biological samples. To overcome these challenges, contemporary mathematical and engineering methods will be used in this project to develop the next-generation nano-CT system.\r\n\r\nThe nano-CT system will accelerate progress in medicine, biology, nanotechnology, materials, and energy. When combined with our existing micro-CT scanners of 0.5-20\u00ecm resolution, the resulting multiscale CT facility will quickly become a regional center serving many users. As the only 50nm resolution CT scanner on the East Coast and the only CT system with narrow beam targeting and accurate interior reconstruction capabilities in the world, this instrument will be invaluable to both institutions and industries in the US. Furthermore, this project will facilitate nanotechnology teaching and training at Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University, benefiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented and diverse groups. Finally, this system will be commercialized in collaboration with the leading nano-CT company Xradia to create job opportunities and maintain US leadership in this area.",
