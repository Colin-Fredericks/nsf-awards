 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program is designed to understand how the prairie grasslands and forests of the Midwest function and how this functioning may be influenced by human activities. The research combines large, well-replicated, long-term experiments with long-term observations in native ecosystems, and uses the results to develop and test theories of ecosystem dynamics and functioning. The experiments focus on how and why the loss of native species, shifts in fire regimes, climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2, and elevated rates of nitrogen deposition affect the productivity, stability and functioning of prairie and forest ecosystems. \r\n\r\nThe results of this research will help to provide solutions to some of the environmental problems the nation and world face as global population approaches 9 or 10 billion people.  Some human actions are decreasing the ability of ecosystems around the world to provide goods and services vital to humanity.  Cedar Creek research addresses how human activities alter the ability of natural and managed grasslands and forests to remove carbon dioxide from the atmospheric and store it in soils and plants, purify groundwater, produce sustainable biofuels, and increate soil fertility; and seeks ways that these abilities can be improved and restored. The program will continue its history of creative dissemination of results to the broader public and of advising government official and agencies. Its signature professional development program trains both K-12 teachers and students, and included 6000 teachers and students in 2011. The site's education program will continue partnerships to train educators of Native American students and strengthen engagement with urban, underserved schools. Diverse undergraduate students from across the country together with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained through this highly integrative program.",

CDR science emphasizes the ways that human-caused environmental changes -- loss of native biodiversity, shifts in species composition and land use, climate change, elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen (N) deposition -- impact the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and their ability to provide the services that support human health and well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p>\n<p><span>CDR's long-term experiments have led to important insights into the long-term effects of global change. For example, a synthesis of results from three grassland experiments showed that chronic N enrichment initially increased plant growth and led to losses of some plant species from the community. These losses reduced the positive effects of N fertilization on plant growth because plant species that were able to use N efficiently to grow were particular vulnerable to being lost (Attachment 1). The interactions between plant diversity and total plant growth were further explored in a study synthesizing data from 12 long-term experiments at CDR that manipulated global change drivers, including biodiversity, N, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, fire, herbivory, and water. Those factors that altered the number of plant species in the community also altered how much plant growth fluctuated across years ? communities with more species fluctuated less in the face of year-to-year changes in climate (Attachment 2).&nbsp;A unique feature of the long-term experiments at CDR is their focus on how different global changes interact. For example, in an experiment that manipulates plant diversity, CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen, and rainfall, plant growth was unchanged by elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;when both water and N were at low supply, but when either water or N were at higher supply levels, plant growth increased with elevated CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(Attachment 3).</span></p>\n<p><span>This award supported the establishment of new experiments at CDR that also have led to novel insights. For example, a new experiment examined the importance of the number of tree species, their evolutionary relatedness, and the diversity of their characteristics for forest ecosystems.

CDR strengthened partnerships to engage Native American students, English Language Learners, and underserved urban schools. Science identity, content knowledge, and career preparedness were assessed following field trips.
