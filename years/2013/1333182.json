 "awd_abstract_narration": "he grant provides funding to develop novel processing techniques for seedless growth of transparent conducting oxide nanowires and selective coating of nanowires with multiple kinds of semiconductor nanoparticles. We will probe to uncover the mechanism responsible for the heterogeneous nucleation of the nanowires on the oxide layer. The composition and thickness of the thin oxide layer will be controlled to facilitate the nucleation and growth of the oxide nanowires. On the surface of the nanowires, semiconductor nanoparticles will be selectively positioned by a modified electrodeposition process. The location of different semiconductor nanoparticle layers will be determined by their light absorption spectrum. Nanoparticles absorbing the light with longer wavelength will be placed to be close to the bottom of the nanowires to harvest all of visible light spectrum. These hybrid nanowire arrays will be characterized using electrical, optical, and chemical methods.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the expected outcomes of this research will lead to inorganic composite arrays that will harvest all visible components of incoming solar light. Multilayer semiconductor nanoparticle arrays will make the light absorption spectrum of the composite arrays much broader than that of current semiconductor materials. Moreover, the proposed research will deliver a comprehensive understanding of carrier loss mechanisms at various surfaces and interfaces for better electronic conduction. A combination of panchromatic light absorption capability and fast carrier transport will contribute to manufacturing high performance photoelectrochemical cells. The broader impact of the research lies in its potential to provide the highly efficient energy conversion and storage devices using a low cost and continuous manufacturing process. This will take us one step closer toward realizing the development of fully integrated complex hybrid, flexible electronic systems for many applications such as healthcare and environmental monitoring.",

Utilization of the appropriate sensitizers plays a vital role toward improvement in the efficiency of PEC devices by photon harvesting in entire part of the visible spectrum. Currently it is very difficult to get desired PEC performance by using only a single layered material because they only absorb a relatively narrow range of the solar spectrum and imperfections in transfer of electrons; therefore multi-layered heteronanostructure appears as a promising way to extending the optical absorption in entire visible region by using complementary materials in their spectral response. Narrow band gap semiconductors have been attracting great attention as panchromatic sensitizers in semiconductor-sensitized photovoltaic cells due to their broad spectra of light absorption. Panchromatic light absorption has been emerging as an alternative approach to specific tuning of light absorption and energetic of semiconductor sensitizers. In this regard, panchromatic device, which is sensitive to wide range of visible colors of the spectrum, appears to be promising solution for efficient photovoltaic devices. The advantage of panchromatic devices exhibition of excellent photovoltaic properties and displaying strikingly strong absorption in broad wavelength region, as well as the spectral response enlarged at longer wavelengths as well as in the shorter wavelength region. Therefore, the co-sensitized device can take advantage of both types of light sensitizers. We compared three electrode configurations in this study. Firstly, single sensitized photoelectrodes with co-sensitized ones, secondly typical cascade structured co-sensitized photoelectrodes with sequentially co-sensitized photoelectrodes, and lastly the effect of Sb doping into SnO<sub>2</sub> photoelectrode to see the change in photocurrent density. The SnO<sub>2</sub> NW<sub>S</sub> are firstly grown on the FTO/glass substrate by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method and finally CdS and CdSe sequentially deposited by electrochemical deposition. Furthermore multilayer engineering of 1D nanostructures approach with sequential sensitization of different band gap of light absorbers, CdS (broader E<sub>g</sub>, <em>blue region</em>) and CdSe (narrower E<sub>g</sub>, <em>red region</em>), is performed in order to benefit from different absorption properties of each material and hence extending the array of light absorption. The cascade heterostructure of CdSe/CdS/SnO<sub>2</sub> helps efficient charge separation (e<sup>-</sup>/h<sup>+</sup>) and efficient electron transport.
