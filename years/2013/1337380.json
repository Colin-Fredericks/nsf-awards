 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing\r\nand debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and\r\ncommunication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture,\r\ncompilers, chips, and systems. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by\r\nobtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA\r\nconference in June, 2013 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Priority will be given to US\r\ncitizens and permanent residents, students from under-represented groups, and students\r\nthat will be presenting their research at ISCA or its joint workshops. \r\nThe ISCA conference will be strengthened as a\r\nresult of the greater attendance that this travel support will enable. Students receiving travel\r\nsupport will personally benefit from the opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as establish\r\nconnections that will help their professional careers.\r\nMore broadly, we expect additional indirect impacts. First, we plan to widely advertise the available\r\nsupport in order to attract women and under-represented minority groups (through postings on computer\r\narchitecture web-sites and mailing lists). Second, by focusing on students, the grant will help foster the\r\nmentoring of subsequent generations of computer architects.",

This was one of the most successful ISCA conferences in recent years with a strong collection of talks, keynotes, workshops, tutorials, and social events that encouraged extensive interactions.\n\nThe NSF funds were used to fund 10 applicants, who each received a grant of $1,500.  All of these recipients currently attend US universities.  Some of the recipients belong to under-represented groups.  For example, the recipients include three females, one Hispanic, one undergraduate, one student from an under-represented school, and a couple of students that would not have the means to attend without a travel grant.\n\nApplications were solicited via the conference web-site and via emails to authors and mailing lists.  Students were asked to provide relevant information along with a confirmatory email from their advisors.  Every applicant received a travel grant from one of the available sources (NSF, IEEE TCCA, ACM SIGARCH, Google, VMWare).  The NSF travel grant awardees were selected with a focus on increasing participation from under-represented groups.  All travel grant awardees were asked to send a few paragraphs summarizing their experiences and observations.
