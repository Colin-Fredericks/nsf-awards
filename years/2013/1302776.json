Additional information can be found on the confernce website: http://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/TORA/TORA4.html\r\n\r\nOver the last century, the theories of automorphic forms and  representations have grown enormously. Important applications impact various fields of research, ranging from number theory, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and topology to Kac-Moody algebras and quantum field theory. The interplay of automorphic forms and representation theory has been especially fruitful, and many surprising and deep results have emerged. The TORA conference series will emphasize the interplay between automorphic forms and representations, both in the classical and adelic languages, and related topics like analytic number theory and harmonic analysis.\r\n\r\nThe TORA mathematics conference series consists of semi-annual meetings hosted by the University of North Texas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma on a rotating basis. This award provides support for three weekend conferences, one at the University of North Texas in Spring 2013 (TORA IV), one at Oklahoma State University in Fall 2013 (TORA V), and another at the University of Oklahoma in Spring 2014 (TORA VI). Each conference will feature two or three prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region, in addition to other participants including students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Regional graduate students and  researchers will also give talks describing their work. These conferences will facilitate collaborations and interactions among the students and researchers in the region who work in the areas of Automorphic Forms, Representation Theory, and Number Theory.",
