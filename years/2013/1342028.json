 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1342028\r\nThere is growing interest in the development of nanocomposites consisting of organic polymers\r\nand various nanomaterials. These new materials can provide unique functionalities as compared\r\nto unmodified polymers in terms of dielectric, magnetic, thermal, mechanical, optical, transport,\r\npermeation and separation properties. Although nanomaterials are considered potentially hazardous,\r\nthey are often considered safe when encapsulated into the matrix. However, systematic research\r\nto confirm the abovementioned paradigm is lacking, despite the potential risks of nanomaterial\r\nrelease to human health and environment.\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nCurrent research on the stability of nanocomposites has focused primarily on short term stability\r\nand performance, whereas the longer term issues have not been properly addressed. This knowledge\r\ngap has the potential to hinder both applications and acceptance of polymers in various industries.\r\nMore specifically, stability of both matrix and nanocomposites are of critical importance.\r\nIt is known that the polymer matrix can undergo degradation when exposed to various environmental\r\nconditions during production, use and disposal. This can lead to nanofiller release, which\r\ncan potentially cause various health and environmental problems. Therefore, it is absolutely\r\ncritical to understand the behavior of nanocomposites under relevant environmental conditions.\r\nMore specifically, evaluation of the amounts and rates of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) release\r\nfrom composites has been a tremendous challenge for the existing analytical techniques so\r\nfar. This project will utilize C-14 labeled CNTs which will allow us to quantify the released\r\nCNTs using a relatively simple analytical technique. This will be of tremendous value for\r\nadvancing our knowledge of various CNTs exposure scenarios by developing accurate metrology\r\ntools. This tool can be also vital for development of accurate life cycle assessments of CNTs\r\nencapsulated into the polymer composites.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThis project can significantly impact nanotoxicology, environmental engineering, materials\r\nscience and green chemistry/engineering areas through evaluation of various strategies for\r\ndelivering functional nanocomposites with reduced health and environmental impacts. These\r\napproaches are designed to make timely contributions to a basic understanding of the environmental\r\nhealth and safety of nanotechnology. During the course of this project, the students will\r\ngain fundamental and applied knowledge in many areas of science and engineering encompassing\r\nenvironmental health and safety of nanotechnology. Our team has already utilized the resources\r\nof a new NSF REU site in Nanotechnology for Health, Energy, and the Environment at Stony Brook\r\nUniversity. We will continue to recruit students through the REU site, which focuses on students\r\nfrom non-research, 4-year institutions with this research project. Through several recruitment\r\nmechanisms already established at the Stony Brook University we will reach underrepresented\r\ngroups, including students from minority and economically disadvantaged communities as well\r\nas females. All these activities will establish a good foundation to achieve notable broader\r\nimpacts of this proposal",
