Now that so much scientific publishing involves data and takes place through a database rather than conventional journals, how is some part of a database to be cited? More generally, how should data stored in a repository that has complex internal structure and that is subject to change be cited?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the increasingly large number of possible citations; the need for citations to be both human and machine readable; and the need for citations to conform to various specifications and standards. A basic assumption is that citations must be generated, on the fly, from the database.  The framework is validated by a prototype system in which citations conforming to pre-specified standards are automatically generated from the data, and tested on operational databases of pharmacological and Earth science data.  The broader impact of this research is on scientists who publish their findings in organized data collections or databases; data centers that publish and preserve data; businesses and government agencies that provide on-line reference works; and on various organizations who formulate data citation principles. The research also tackles the issue of how to enrich linked data so that it can be properly cited.\r\n",

It is used to gauge the trust placed in published information and, for better or for worse, is an important factor in judging academic reputation. Now that so much scientific publishing involves data and takes place through a database rather than conventional journals, the question becomes:  How should data that is retrieved by a query over a database be cited?\n\nA number of scientific databases currently specify what snippets of information to include in citations to certain web-page views of the data. However, this approach has two limitations:  First, the web-page views do not cover all subsets of the database that could be retrieved by queries.  Second, the citations are rarely generated automatically, leaving it to the user to construct them by hand.  Therefore, data citations are often incomplete, difficult to use, or not used at all. \n\nThis research has developed techniques and prototypes to automatically generate citations to data returned by arbitrary queries over a database.  The approach is based on a notion of \"citation views\" which specify how to construct the citation to a small number of frequent queries (e.g. the web-page views), including the snippets of information to be used to construct the citation (e.g. author and title) as well as how they are to be combined to create a citation (e.g. in BibTex or RIS format). To create a citation to a general query (that is, a query which is not a citation view), the system rewrites it in terms of the view queries, and combines the associated citations using policies specified by the database administrator.    The approach can be used to generate \"fine-grained\" citations to arbitrary subsets of the result data by reasoning at the level of individual tuples.\n\nThe citation view framework has been implemented for both relational and RDF datasets, and tested on operational databases of pharmacological (IUPHAR) and Earth science (ES3) information, a resource discovery framework (eagle-i), and the Reactome Pathway database.  \n\nThis research has also provided a connection between data citation and data provenance, which addresses the questions of how, where and why a tuple appears in the query result.  By reasoning over provenance rather than merely using the query and citation views, it is possible to provide citations for a much richer class of queries, including those using aggregate functions (e.g. sum, count, min, max) that frequently appear in statistical queries.\n\nIn addition to identifying the computational challenges involved in data citation and building prototype systems, this research has made fundamental contributions to the field of databases by developing techniques for query rewriting using views in graph databases as well as in \"big data\".  It has also extended the class of queries for which provenance is understood to ones involving aggregate operators, and operations over data that include matrix operations, which are especially important in the context of machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe broader impact of this research is on scientists who publish their findings in organized data collections or databases; data centers that publish and preserve data; businesses and government agencies that provide on-line reference works; and on various organizations who formulate data citation principles.
