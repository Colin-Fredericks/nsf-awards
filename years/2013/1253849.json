 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why there are so many flowering plants is an evolutionary conundrum that has puzzled biologists since Darwin's time. Although the group is evolutionarily quite young, there are over 250,000 species of flowering plants. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that reciprocal adaptation between plants and their pollinators (a process known as coevolution) is responsible for the spectacular number of species of flowering plants, but evidence supporting this idea is circumstantial. This project tests this hypothesis by measuring coevolution between yuccas and yucca moths. The yucca / yucca moth interaction is widely referred to as a model system for studying coevolution, but no study has ever conclusively demonstrated coevolution between them. This project will use experimental manipulations of yuccas and yucca moths to determine whether the plants and their pollinators are adapting to one another. Genomic technologies will identify genetic factors associated with plant and pollinator features and determine whether they are coevolving. Finally, genetic tools will be used to determine whether coevolution was involved in the evolution of new species of yuccas and yucca moths. \r\n\r\nThis project provides one of the first direct tests of the hypothesis that coevolution promotes the evolution of new species, and will significantly advance our understanding of how the diversity of life originated. Integral to the research are three novel educational initiatives: a citizen science program involving the general public in field studies of coevolution, a summer research immersion course for undergraduates, and a program to train a postdoctoral scientist in best practices for integrating teaching and research.",

Unlike almost all other insects, Yucca moths seem to 'intentionally' pollinate the flowers that they visit. The moths use unique, tentacle-like mouthparts to gather pollen and then push it onto the stigma -- the part of the flower that is receptive to pollen. In exchange for pollination, the moths lay their eggs in the yucca flowers, and their larvae eat a portion of the seeds.

In addition, we found evidence that 'genes' associated with flowers seem to be particularly likely to experience natural selection, which might mean that their yucca moth pollinators are indeed exerting natural selection on Joshua trees.

In a region of the desert where both of the yucca moth species and the two Joshua trees that they pollinate co-occur, we experimentally introduced different species of moth onto different species of Joshua tree, and onto trees with variously shaped flowers. The results of this experiment indicate that trees produce fewer fruit (a measure of fitness) when they are pollinated by the 'wrong' moth. In addition, hybrid trees produced fewer fruit than either of 'pure' species, regardless of which moth pollinated them. However, to our surprise, flower shape seemed not to make as big a difference as tree species did.
