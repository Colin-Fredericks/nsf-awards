 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed collaborative research is to develop a plasmonically enhanced optical\r\nring resonator (PEORR) sensor array for unlabelled biomolecule detection at the single molecule level.\r\nThe proposed hybrid sensor synergizes microfabricated ring resonators and nanofabricated plasmonic\r\nnanostructures. It takes advantage of the excellent sensing resolution associated with the ring resonator\r\nand the tremendously enhanced sensitivity arising from the plasmonic nanostructures to achieve single\r\nmolecule detection, and of the carousel effect from the ring resonator for efficient capture and transport of\r\nbiomolecules for sample enrichment and expeditious detection. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Detection and study of biomolecules at the single molecule level allow to probe and\r\ncharacterize molecules in unprecedented detail. Traditional single molecule detection relies primarily on\r\nfluorescence microscopy, which requires sophisticated instruments and complicated dye labeling\r\nprocesses that may adversely affect a molecules functionality.\r\n \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed project will be carried out synergistically by the terms from the University\r\nof Michigan and the Polytechnic Institute at New York University. Graduate students will be\r\ntrained in interdisciplinary science and will work in each of the two labs through an exchange program.\r\nUndergraduate students will be paired with graduate students to obtain hands-on experience. Videos on\r\nYoutube will be jointly created to publicize the research findings. Finally, the PI will work with local non-\r\nPh.D. granting colleges to develop a summer program for their students to conduct research in the PI's\r\nlab at the University of Michigan.",
