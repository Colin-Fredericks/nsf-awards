 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of phased array technology for meteorological applications has been realized recently with the development of research platforms such as the National Weather Radar Testbed and mobile Doppler phased array radars for rapid scanning such as the Rapid-DOW, MWR-05XP, and Atmospheric Imaging Radar. With these and initiatives such as the Multi-mission Phased Array Radar and the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), there is growing interest in the potential for use of phased array radars in weather surveillance and measurement. However, because the operational weather radar networks in the U.S. are now adopting dual polarization, it is anticipated that it will be necessary for future phased-array systems to support polarimetry for improved hydrometeor identification and rainfall estimation, with the same fidelity as is possible with today's reflector antennas.\r\n\r\nThe Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory in collaboration with the CASA Engineering Research Center, has recently developed a mobile, dual-polarization, solid-state, X-band active phased-array weather radar. With this award, experiments will be performed with this active phased-array radar to study its polarization performance, calibration and stability, biases, and other uncertainties particular to phased-array weather radar antennas. This array will be used in specific deployments and experiments of opportunity to gain experience in the practicalities of phased-array radar polarimetry.\r\n\r\nA combination of calibration experiments will be performed locally as well as deployments to the Great Plains. In particular, the radar will be deployed during two successive spring seasons to the Dallas/Fort Worth Urban Testbed, a quasi-operational/research radar network initiated by the CASA Engineering Research Center and primarily sponsored by the North Texas Council of Governments. Here, the phased-array radar will observe severe weather in tandem with other similarly sized, X-band, mechanically scanned dual-polarization radars. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research is experimental investigation of the impacts of polarization imperfections and projection errors and their compensation with a real dual-polarization phased-array radar, as well as characterization of the beam quality (sidelobes, precise matching of H- and V-polarized beams, cross-polarization) with a low-cost phased array. The performance will be benchmarked both via calibration targets and observations of weather with companion mechanically scanned antennas.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research are improved understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of severe storms and their formation, ultimately leading to improved predictions of severe weather events. The incorporation of new technologies in weather observation will also inform users' interpretations and expectations of radar measurements for these purposes. In addition, the project includes strong involvement of graduate students from UMass working with investigators and users of the DFW Testbed. The phased-array radar will also serve as a teaching tool at UMass and at U. of Texas Arlington during deployments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we studied the performance of a phased-array radar for observing weather phenomena.  Phased-arrays are flat-panels consisting of many antennas that allow scanning through electronic means, rather than physically moving or rotating a conventional antenna such as a parabolic dish.  As they have no moving parts, they are not susceptible to mechanical failure, and they can scan rapidly and arbitrarily since there is no inertia to overcome.   They are being considered as a potential future solution for both weather observation and air traffic monitoring and control. \n\nThe particular phased array employed in this study operated at X-band (3 cm wavelength), and employed dual polarization.  It is called the Phase-Tilt Weather Radar (PTWR) as it scans electronically in azimuth, but is mechanically tilted in elevation.  Owing to the peculiar scan characteristics of this radar, there exists the potential for biased observations of weather phenomena, and we performed field studies to test whether such biases were significant.   The PTWR was deployed in Arlington, TX for an 8 week period during Spring 2014.  Observations by the radar of precipitation and severe weather were compared to a nearby mechanically-scanning X-band radar employing a dual-polarized parabolic dish antenna.  At elevation angles below 10 degrees, the two radars' observations differed only slightly, however the differences were not attributable to the aforementioned biases, but appeared primarily due to differences in the beam widths of the two radars.  At higher-elevation tilts, the coupling of the true elevation angle with the array's azimuth scan angle complicated interpretation of features at constant altitude such as the melting layer.\n\nThe PTWR has since been deployed at the UMass campus for further calibration and stability studies.  These have shown the characteristics of the radar to be stable over time.  The project resulted in one Ph.D. and two M.S. degrees for graduate students studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.  This study was somewhat limited as the PTWR array scans electronically only in one dimension.   As such, it could not simulate the arbitrary scan characteristics of 2-D scanning (azimuth and elevation) phased-arrays, where the two polarizations may not be orthogonal.  These will be studied in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen J Frasier"
