 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical models for transpression and extrusion in continental collisional zones have evolved markedly since the original model of Sanderson and Marchini (1984), driven largely by modeling and analysis of real zones of transpression. A zone of mid-crustal transpression and extrusion exhibiting a range of structures that record markedly different states of finite strain suggestive of contraction, wrenching, and extension serves as a natural laboratory to test a fundamental aspect of transpression and extrusion models: testing via precise geochronology whether simultaneous vs. sequential deformation occurred across the system. Mapping and structural analysis at a range of scales demonstrate that the transpression/extrusion system in the northern Appalachian orogen contains elements of classical transpression models, elements proposed for more complex systems of triclinic symmetry, and elements not predicted by models. Linked kinematics along boundaries and lack of overprinting relationships are consistent with some elements being components of a simultaneous partitioned dextral transpression zone, whereas other elements appear to have developed later in the deformation history or outlasted deformation in the other zones. Geochronologic methods applied to strategically selected samples will be used to determine absolute timing of deformation within the transpression/extrusion system. Pseudosection analysis and conventional mineralogic geothermobarometry will be completed in order to obtain temperature constraints for interpreting geochronology and depth constraints for the present level of exposure of the former mid-crustal setting. Strain and vorticity analysis in each element of the system will be performed in order to assess contributions of coaxial vs. simple shear.\r\n\r\nMountain belts such as the Appalachians are the expression of colliding continental plates. As a result of the compressional stresses in collision zones, the crust may be uplifted vertically and/or pushed aside laterally (extruded). Full understanding of the collision history and mechanism of mountain belt formation requires (1) examination of structural and mineralogical features in rocks that are expressed at the map (kilometers to hundreds of kilometers), outcrop (meters to hundreds of meters), hand sample, and the microscopic scale; and (2) determination of the absolute age of geologic events via radiometric dating methods. Our previous research in the northern Appalachians of central Massachusetts identified features suggestive of oblique (glancing blow), rather than orthogonal (head-on) collision, which is the prevailing paradigm. The proposed research will involve field and laboratory studies by a team of geoscientists, including a faculty member, post-doctoral research associate, graduate student, and undergraduate student from the University of Kentucky, working in collaboration with faculty at three other institutions and a secondary earth science educator from the local school system, to collect, measure, and interpret the data necessary to distinguish between the two collision alternatives, and to carry out the geochronology needed to determine precisely when the deformation of the crust occurred. The project activities will further the professional development of the junior geoscientists and the research results will be disseminated at professional meetings and in peer-reviewed journals.",

This section of crust was situated between two blocks of continental crust converging at an angle of 45<sup>o</sup>.&nbsp; This high angle collision resulted in simultaneous compression and shear (&ldquo;transpression&rdquo;). &nbsp;The collision may have also resulted in extrusion of a slice of crust to the north out of the zone of transpression. In order for this to occur, simultaneous right-lateral (i.e., looking across a fault one would see that the opposite side was shifting to the right of the observer) and left-lateral displacement (leftward shifting on opposite side of fault) had to occur along the eastern and western boundaries of the zone of transpression (ZoT), respectively. The research was designed to test the hypothesis that extrusion was accommodated by simultaneous deformation along the western (Mount Dumplin shear zone) and eastern (Conant Brook shear zone) boundaries. This hypothesis is important to test because the study area is an ancient analog for the middle crust beneath major strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas fault. The study area is also an ancient analog for Turkey, which is being extruded laterally &nbsp;toward the Aegean Sea. Testing the hypothesis requires radiometric dating of minerals formed during the transpression process, or by dating igneous rock masses that were deformed in the transpression process.</p>\n<p>We employed the following geochronometers to determine the absolute time of deformation in the bounding shear zones: (1) U-Pb geochronology by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on zircon grains that were separated from deformed granitic rocks; (2) Th-Pb SIMS isotope geochronology on monazite grains separated from deformed metamorphic rocks; (3) and U-Th-Pb monazite chemical age dating via electron probe microanalysis. The primary outcomes are:</p>\n<p>1. All deformed granitic rocks within the zone of transpression are older than approximately 350 million years (Ma). &nbsp;This requires that deformation related to right lateral shear in the ZoT is younger than 350 Ma, but probably commenced close to that time.</p>\n<p>2. Monazite U-Th-Pb chemical ages from sheared metamorphic rocks along the eastern boundary of the ZoT range over 60 m.y. of time starting at ca. 360 Ma but the youngest ages are 330 Ma. With the ages from zircon above, this means that right lateral displacement along the eastern boundary of the ZoT started 350 million years ago (Ma) and continued through 330 Ma. This means that right lateral displacement occurred within the zone of transpression in that same time frame.</p>\n<p>3. Samples from the western boundary of the ZoT that exhibit left lateral displacement yield monazite U-Th-Pb chemical ages that are distinctly younger than the monazite ages from throughout the zone of transpression. These ages range from 330 to 290 Ma. Therefore, the results negate the hypothesis being tested that the right lateral Conant Brook shear zone and left lateral Mount Dumplin shear zone are contemporaneous, conjugate shear zones along which extrusion occurred. The timing of left lateral shear deformation in the Mount Dumplin shear zone is contemporaneous with deformation farther east in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and future work should examine those areas for the conjugate shear zone to the Mount Dumplin shear zone. The difference between the two zones is illustrated in Figure 4.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader (societal) impacts of the research are:</p>\n<p>1. A post-doctoral research associate received scientific training. The post-doc co-managed the research project by overseeing the progress of the students involved in the project. The post-doc is now permanently employed by the Kentucky Geological Survey.</p>\n<p>2. A graduate student received scientific training and completed a M.S. degree at the University of Kentucky. That student is now employed as a petroleum geologist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. An undergraduate student received scientific training and part time employment as a participant. &nbsp;That student will enroll in graduate school at the University of Kentucky in January 2017.</p>\n<p>4. Five high school students from a STEM magnetic school participated in the project, conducting the same analysis as the grad student.

The post-doc and PI prepared a field trip guide for the 2015 New England Intercollegiate Geological Conference.
