It makes use of a new human-in-the-loop smartphone-based crowd-sourcing sensing technology, called TrafficTurk. TrafficTurk is a smartphone application which enables intelligent, human?centric sensing of traffic flows during extreme events.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Sandy represents a rare opportunity to observe transient behavior of a transportation network in response to a significant loss of physical infrastructure (due to flooding and gas shortages) and cyber infrastructure (due to loss of power for traffic control devices). The data gathered by this project, which will be shared with researchers across the country, will enable study of how traffic dynamics evolve after a major disruption to the cyber and physical components of a transportation infrastructure system.  Potential benefits include improved preparedness and response to future disasters.",
