 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this REESE medium empirical research study, being conducted by Education Development Center, Inc.'s Center for Children and Technology (EDC/CCT), the PIs are systematically testing comparative advantages of different design features of digital games in support of science learning.  Their hypothesis is that experience in a domain learners are already familiar with and that is analogous to a targeted science domain can aid learning in the science domain if practice in the analogous domain is aimed towards helping learners better make sense of those aspects of the familiar domain that are difficult to understand in the targeted science domain. They are exploring this representational hypothesis in three science domains: electricity, photosynthesis, and heat transfer. In a first phase, they are comparing practice and experiences in preparation for learning in each domain, comparing, for each, preparation for learning in the context of a game that is mimetic (gives learners a chance to practice making sense of the science domain itself) and one that is non-mimetic (gives learners a chance to make better sense of an analogous domain they are already familiar with). In later phases of the work, they are investigating the role of and best practices for explicit analogy guidance by teachers as they help learners transfer what they are learning in the games to solving real-world problems in the science domain. The aim is to identify good practices for helping middle-grade science learners consolidate and transfer conceptual understanding beyond the problems they are practicing on. In addition to drawing out lessons about how non-mimetic practice can make contributions to students? understanding of difficult science concepts, the study also explores questions about making intuitive experiences in a game world accessible for consolidation and application and the roles of explicit analogical mapping during instruction as a method for supporting sense-making and consolidation of emergent conceptual models of the target science concepts. They are identifying the interrelationship of these features of game play as steps in coming to deep understanding of science concepts.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of electronic games have the potential to provide learners with engaging environments for making sense of and practicing use of new science concepts. Yet there is little known right now about how to design and implement educational games to support deep conceptual understanding of targeted science. This project has the potential to transform approaches to developing games for science learning that support sustained sense making and consolidation around difficult science concepts and that promote transfer of conceptual understanding beyond the problems learners are practicing with. This project is generating critical new knowledge to guide development of learning experiences and pedagogy in support of middle-grade science learning, especially addressing the needs of struggling students who require more engaging and playful approaches in order to deeply learn.",

Many scientific concepts can be counterintuitive, which is why they can be difficult to understand. For example, take the common misconception that plants get food by &ldquo;eating&rdquo; soil rather than making food from carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis. If students use humans as a model, it makes sense to believe that plants would eat solid food, just like humans. Photosynthesis, on the other hand, is difficult to comprehend. How can solid matter be made out of a liquid (water) and a gas (carbon dioxide)? Dismantling incorrect scientific beliefs requires exposing students to models that accurately reflect the processes and relationships underlying difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analogies can be very effective for helping students understand science concepts that are hard to visualize because they enable students to connect a familiar concept (the analogy <em>source</em>) to concepts they are learning (the analogy <em>target</em>). Researchers who study the use of analogies have identified specific ways teachers can integrate analogies into instruction that are particularly effective for learning. For example, certain techniques such as using visuals, comparative gestures, guiding questions, and attending to similarities in processes and relationships can help students explicitly map the relationships between the source and the target analog to build new knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, <em>Digital games as analogical sources for science learning,</em>researchers from Education Development Center, Inc. examined whether digital games could be used as a compelling analogy source to help middle school students learn challenging science concepts. The three digital games that we used in the study took place in imaginary worlds but incorporated images and actions that are analogous to photosynthesis, electricity, and heat transfer, topics that all relate to the larger crosscutting concept of energy transfer. During the first two years of this project, we worked with teachers and students in low-income schools to develop instructional sequences and materials to be used after students play the games, which &ldquo;map&rdquo; the game analogies to the target science concepts. Figures 1-3 present visuals of the materials. Figure 1 displays an image from <em>The Ruby Realm</em> photosynthesis game, in which a robot creates glucose using artificial photosynthesis. Figure 2 presents a slide from the instructional materials that asks students to talk about what they did in the game. Figure 3 presents a slide from the instructional materials that asks students to draw an analogy between what they did in the game and the target science content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the third year of the project we conducted a study that explored whether students who played the games and whose teachers used the analogy mapping instructional materials learned more than students who played the same digital games but whose teachers used a different set of instructional activities that focused on similar science content. Figure 4 shows a teacher using the instructional materials. Figure 5 shows a student using the instructional materials. We discovered that the games and analogy mapping materials supported engaging conversations around science concepts, led treatment teachers to make six times as many references to analogies as teachers in the comparison condition, and led students in the treatment condition to demonstrate a greater understanding of electricity and energy transfer on average than those in the comparison condition, as measured by multiple choice assessments of those concepts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: This study was based on the theory that analogies can be effective for helping students learn novel concepts by connecting those new concepts to ones with which they are familiar, as well as research that identifies specific instructional techniques for mapping analogies using visual materials, gestures, and discussion. The findings from this study provide further support for these theories and approaches by showing that digital games can serve as a source for drawing analogies to science concepts when they are used in conjunction with research-based techniques.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impact: The findings from this study have implications for researchers, educators, and game developers wishing to understand how to integrate digital games effectively into classroom instruction and how to help students in this age group learn challenging science concepts. Analogies can enable students to gain an understanding of new, abstract concepts, but they are more likely to improve learning when students and teachers have conversations during which they explicitly compare the relationships between the source and target, and can see visual depictions of these alignments repeatedly. Digital games can serve as motivating interactive experiences that can be the foundation of a compelling analogy. However, student engagement in and mastery of a game on its own will not necessarily lead to learning. Our study suggests that deliberate, scaffolded discussions, supported by visual materials, about how the game elements map to the analogous science concepts, can solidify student learning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/20/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Wendy&nbsp;Martin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252382/1252382_10281230_1511195928536_BioBotBobglucoseimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252382/1252382_10281230_1511195928536_BioBotBobglucoseimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
