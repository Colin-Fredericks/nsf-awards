 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit.  In order to fit within the small confines of a cell nucleus, DNA molecules need to be compacted through interactions with a number of proteins to form a complex referred to as chromatin.  The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, a particle consisting of DNA wrapped around a disc-like structure composed of histone proteins.  In addition to directing DNA compaction in cells, nucleosomes are also important participants in most of the processes that occur on chromosomes, including the process of gene transcription.  The focus of Dr. Duina's research is to elucidate the mechanisms that control the elongation phase of transcription, the phase during which DNA is copied into RNA molecules, in the context of chromatin.  The project has two aims.  One is to better define how yFACT, a complex with well-defined roles in transcription elongation, interacts with chromatin on transcribed genes. The other aim is to establish whether TORC1, a complex responsible for coordinating nutrient signals with cell growth and division, has a role in promoting transcription elongation across genes.  These experiments will be carried out using biochemical and genetic approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the model system.  Given the high degree of evolutionary conservation between yeast and human cells, the results obtained will provide novel insights into basic biological processes relevant to all eukaryotic organisms.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  This project will provide an exceptional opportunity for undergraduate students to be involved in meaningful scientific research.  Under the guidance of Dr. Duina, undergraduate students will participate in the design and execution of experiments related to this project and will be fully engaged in the critical evaluation of the data generated from their studies.  In addition, students working in Dr. Duina's laboratory will have the opportunity to present the results from their research at regional and national research conferences.  This project will also include the participation of undergraduate students outside the context of Dr. Duina's laboratory, as a subset of the experiments will be carried out by students enrolled in one of the courses taught by Dr. Duina at the college.  Collectively, these experiences will introduce undergraduate students to the wonderful world of scientific research and will undoubtedly play critical roles in shaping their career choices as they progress through college and beyond.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWithin the cell nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA is compacted through the association with protein complexes known as histone octamers, each of which is composed of pairs of four histone proteins referred to as histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B.  In the initial phase of DNA compaction, approximately 147 base-pairs of DNA are wrapped around an histone octamer, forming a particle referred to as the nucleosome.  In addition to guiding DNA compaction, histones play active roles in most processes that occur across chromosomes, including DNA transcription, replication, and repair.  In general, the presence of nucleosomes is inhibitory to these processes and a variety of mechanisms have evolved that allow cells to manipulate nucleosomes in order to achieve fine-tuned regulation.  FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions) is a highly conserved complex that directly interacts and reorganizes nucleosomes to facilitate a variety of chromosomal processes, including gene transcription.  During the elongation phase of transcription, FACT is required for the disassembly of nucleosomes in order to grant the enzyme required for the synthesis of RNA, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), access to the DNA template.  FACT is also required for the reassembly of nucleosomes in the wake of Pol II passage. \n\n \n\nOur laboratory is interested in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate how FACT interacts with genes during transcription using the budding yeast model system.  In past studies, we have identified histone residues required for proper dissociation of yeast FACT (yFACT) from the 3? end of genes following the end of transcription.  In particular, we found that the H3-L61 and H4-R36 residues are critical to this process, as specific mutations at these locations strongly impair yFACT dissociation from genes.  Experiments performed during this grant period have shed further light on how these residues control proper yFACT dissociation form genes.  Our results are consistent with a model in which H3-L61 normally occupies a small hydrophobic pocket near the H4-R36 residue, and that perturbations of this pocket &ndash; for example through artificial introduction of bulky and/or charged residues in place of H3-L61 &ndash; may in turn affect the orientation of H4-R36, which ultimately may prevent H4-R36 from engaging in interactions with other factors (possibly yFACT itself) required for proper yFACT dissociation.\n\n \n\nIn other experiments, we have identified additional residues in the vicinity of H3-L61 and H4-R36 that impair yFACT dissociation from genes.  These studies lead us to propose that a region on the side of the nucleosome that we call the CSGI (Controls Spt16-Gene Interactions) is required for proper FACT dissociation from chromatin at the end of the transcription process.  Furthermore, our results suggest that the charge landscape within this region may be an important contributor to proper Spt16-gene interactions.  Other outcomes stemming from this grant include the publication of a primer article that introduces various aspects of the budding yeast model system to undergraduate students and other investigators new to this organism and a video article in which we describe a methodology for generating targeted genomic mutations in histone genes in yeast.\n\n \n\nThese studies have been carried out in conjunction with a large number of Hendrix College undergraduate students.  Sixteen undergraduate students have carried out the bulk of the experiments associated with this grant in my research laboratory, and six of them have appeared as co-authors in peer-reviewed publications from the lab.  Several more students will be included as co-authors in a manuscript I plan on submitting for publication within the end of this year.  The majority of these students have presented their work at one or more scientific conferences.  Twenty-four additional students have contributed to this research by carrying out experiments in the context of a course I taught during the Fall semester of 2013.  Students involved in this project have had the chance to experience several facets of the scientific research process, including designing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating their results to other scientists.  Based on feedback from students that have been involved in this project, it is evident that in many cases these experiences have had a strong impact on them as they progressed forward in their career paths.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea A Duina"
