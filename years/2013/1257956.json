 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is a critical nutrient for forests, and scarcity of nitrogen often limits forest growth.  Theoretical considerations in ecology indicate that as a forest ages and its growth slows, its uptake of nitrogen from the soil should also slow, leading to increased loss of nitrogen in drainage water.  Long-term measurements of nitrogen in streams draining the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire contradict this expected pattern. This project seeks to understand the discrepancy between the theory and the data by testing the hypothesis that young forests extract nitrogen from deep soils, but as the forest ages, re-accumulation of the nitrogen in the soil delays the loss of nitrogen in drainage water.  The hypothesis will be tested by a field experiment to determine the propensity for nitrogen accumulation in soil beneath forest stands of different ages, and careful accounting of the amount of nitrogen in a sequence of forests ranging from 15 to over 200 years old.  In addition, a computer simulation model of forest ecosystems will be revised to incorporate these new observations. \r\nThis work is important for management of forests to minimize loss of nitrogen, a key plant nutrient. Air pollution adds excess nitrogen to the forest, and if it is lost in drainage water, it can pollute streams and lakes. The project will involve training of two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates, and a teacher training module will help two high school science teachers develop a unit for teaching about forest ecology in their classrooms. \r\n",

The prevailing theory states that accumulation of critical nutrients (such as nitrogen) in a forest ecosystem over the course of ecosystem succession (development from younger to older stages) is directly related to the accumulation of forest biomass.  We hypothesized that biomass and nutrient accumulation can be de-coupled if critical nutrients can be \"mined\" from the deep soil by trees during periods of fast tree growth (such as in a young forest stand), followed re-accumulation of those nutrients later in succession as tree growth slows. Essentially, we hypothesize that the deep soils act as a nitrogen \"bank,\" from which trees can \"borrow\" to support periods of faster growth, but which must be \"repaid\" later on.\n\nWe evaluated this hypothesis using an integrated set of comparative studies, field experiments, and computer modeling focused on a set of eight forest stands in the White Mts. of New Hampshire.  The stands span a range from very young (&lt;25 years old) to old-growth (&gt; 200 years old).   Our results are largely consistent with our hypothesis.  Recently mature stands (approximately 100 years old) had the greatest ability to retain nitrate added to the mineral horizons of the soil, suggesting the capacity for re-accumulation of nitrogen after forest growth has slowed.  In contrast, the soils of old-growth stands exhibited less uptake of nitrate, greater nitrogen recycling by microbes, greater loss of nitrogen to groundwater, and other symptoms of nitrogen \"saturation\".
