 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University is upgrading key components of the campus core network infrastructure, enabling 10-40 Gbps network connections between research units within a Science DMZ, with interconnects via the DYNES network and Internet2 to external research partners such as XSEDE and iPlant. The upgrades include the campus core aggregation switch, two key data centers and six major data generating laboratories and facilities. Monitoring and optimization of overall network services within the upgraded DMZ includes implementation of perfSONAR for on- and off-campus performance monitoring. The DMZ creates a platform capable of integrating into Internet2 and utilizing DYNES and Software Defined Networking for the dynamic establishment of dedicated research network resources. \r\n\r\nThe upgrades transform research in a wide diversity of disciplines at Oregon State University (OSU) that generate and analyze massive data sets that are produced, analyzed and disseminated on- and off-campus. The disciplines affected include genomics and computational biology, image processing and recognition, earthquake and ocean wave physics, landscape remote sensing, pharmacy, clinical veterinary medicine, and earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences. OSU is a land grant, sea grant and sun grant institution. The network upgrades enhance its capability for providing solutions to society's problems in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, fisheries and wildlife management, marine resource management, water quality management, environmental preservation and restoration, and animal and human health. Furthermore, the improved training and education environment that will be created by the upgrades positively impacts the professional development of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and undergraduate researchers.",
