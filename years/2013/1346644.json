 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal supports a workshop for early career and doctoral student researchers in the learning sciences, in conjunction with the 11th International Conference for the Learning Sciences, to: (1) define productive programs of research; (2) develop strong evidence-based arguments in research projects; and (3) identify approaches for creating strong partnerships with practitioners and education leaders.\r\n\r\nIn a prior funded 2010 ICLS workshop for post-doctoral and early career researchers, on-line surveys were developed.  The surveys will be administered to this set of workshop participants as well, to compare outcomes across workshops and gain a sense of how the workshop affects learning and community building.  The workshop includes a small number of international participants.\r\n\r\nThe workshop builds research expertise of the participants and enables young researchers to participate in networks with mentors in ways that will be productive for their careers and for the field of the learning sciences.",
