 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the spatial variability of municipal setback policies in major shale gas areas in Texas.  In this case setback distance can be conceptualized as an absolute space between gas wells and homes, as well as the product of negotiations and knowledge transfers among key policy actors.  By examining the processes underlying the way in which setback distances are set, this research will fill a knowledge gap in the understanding of the placement of shale gas wells, contribute to emergent geographical theories on the mobility of policies across institutional landscapes, and provide critical information for analyzing present and future debates surrounding shale gas drilling in populated areas.  The study will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods and will collect data in several municipalities.  First, a geographic Information System (GIS) database will be developed to identify and stratify cities based on setback distances and gas well density.  Second, interviews will be conducted with multiple policy stakeholders to determine their ideas about, understanding of, and role in establishing setback policies.  Interview data will be analyzed to determine how setback ordinances diffuse, mutate, and/or evolve among municipalities.  \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to on-going policy discussions about shale gas drilling and its impact on residential areas throughout the United States.  Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at the University of North Texas and Texas A&M University will be recruited to participate in the research.  These students will be trained through hands-on field research and data preparation, workshops, mentoring, and will be given opportunities to publicly present their research findings.  In addition, the research will become a component of an undergraduate Geography of Energy course that will include a research component.  A third component incorporates the GIS products generated from this study into a module for high school students.  The module will allow students to determine how GIS tools can be used to understand human dimensions of hydrocarbon extraction; it will also become a tangible educational product to foster additional outreach programs at other high schools.  Finally, this study will inform local, regional, national, and international policies on shale gas drilling in populated areas.  A clear understanding of the motives behind gas well ordinances and the goals of setback distances and how policies formulated in one place are applied elsewhere will be relevant for communities around the world.",
