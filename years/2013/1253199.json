They have recently, for the first time, developed an ultrasound-switchable fluorescence (USF) technique that is fundamentally different from current imaging methods. In this project, they will develop a USF technique for deep tumor (~2-3 cm) microscopic imaging (<100 \u00ecm). The technique will be evaluated and optimized in tissue phantoms, ex vivo tissue samples, and live animals. The research will also be locally and globally integrated with educations of students, high school teachers and the general public. \r\n\r\nThis USF technique will have high spatial resolution (<100 \u00ecm, like high-frequency ultrasound), and relatively large imaging depth (~2-3 cm like low-frequency ultrasound. The proposed USF imaging technique can be potentially used to visualize microscopic structural, functional and molecular information of a small but centimeter deep tumor. It can greatly benefit many types of cancer imaging, such as breast or prostate cancer.",
