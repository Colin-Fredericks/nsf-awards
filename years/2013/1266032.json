 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Timothy K. Minton (Montana State University) is supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) as the Principal Investigator of joint USA-UK team of investigators who represent a unique combination of established expertise in the chemical synthesis and catalytic applications of ionic liquids (ILs) and liquid-crystalline materials (Dr. John M. Slattery and Prof. Duncan W. Bruce; York, UK), experimental measurements of scattering dynamics using laser-based (Prof. Kenneth G. McKendrick and Dr. Matthew L. Costen; Heriot-Watt, UK) or molecular-beam scattering (Minton) methods, and theoretical modeling of gas-liquid interactions (Prof. George C. Schatz; Northwestern, USA).  The UK researchers are supported through a parallel grant issued by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Prof. Schatz is an unfunded collaborator.  This proposal aims to enhance the fundamental understanding of IL surface structure and to relate this new insight to key sustainable applications of ILs.  Inelastic and reactive scattering of atoms and molecules from liquid surfaces will be developed as a new, chemically specific analytical probe.  Two distinct and complementary experimental approaches will be pursued, based on laser-photolysis, laser-spectroscopic probing and molecular-beam scattering.  The laser-based method is well matched to higher-throughput screening of surface composition of a range of samples, while molecular-beam scattering will provide additional information on surface structure for selected liquids.  In combination, they will probe the degree of surface segregation in custom-synthesized, high-purity ILs of recognized practical interest.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental new insight that will be generated is most likely to be exploited for societal benefit through its enabling role in the design and optimization of IL materials for numerous environmentally friendly applications.  The most direct impact will be on processes involving transport through the gas-liquid interface, including various forms of catalysis.  The students and post-docs involved will receive diverse training in modern research methods.  They will have ample opportunities to develop broader, transferable skills and enjoy the cultural benefits of international exchange, equipping them to contribute to the future growth or creation of high-technology companies.  Outreach will be actively promoted through the creation of a new website and associated YouTube channels.  These new resources will promote both the results of the proposed research on ILs and their broader uses in general.  Downloadable objects will be suitable for tutorials and other teaching tools, with the goal of enriching researchers, teachers, students, and the lay public.",

Minton (Montana State University) was supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemical Sciences Division as the Principal Investigator of joint USA-UK team of investigators who represented a unique combination of established expertise in the chemical synthesis and catalytic applications of ionic liquids (ILs) and liquid-crystalline materials (Dr. John M.

The UK researchers were supported through a parallel grant issued by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Prof. Schatz was an unfunded collaborator.  \n\n \nThe gas&ndash;liquid interface remains one of the least explored, but nevertheless most practically important, environments in which molecular collisions take place. These molecular-level processes underlie many bulk phenomena of fundamental and applied interest, spanning evaporation, respiration, multiphase catalysis, and atmospheric chemistry.  The key aims of the project were to pioneer the development of reactive atom scattering as a way to study the chemical structure of a liquid surface and to use this method to enhance the fundamental understanding of the structure of room temperature ionic liquid surfaces, where the composition of the surface layer is crucial for important applications such as supported ionic liquid phase catalysis, gas separation, and CO2 sequestration.  Two distinct and complementary experimental approaches were pursued, based on laser-photolysis&ndash;laser-spectroscopic probing (Heriot-Watt) and molecular-beam scattering (Montana State).  The laser-based method is well matched to higher-throughput screening of surface composition of a range of samples, while molecular-beam scattering provides additional information on surface structure for selected liquids.  In combination, these methods were effective at probing various aspects of chemical structure at ionic liquid surfaces.  The overarching goal of demonstrating the use of reactive atom scattering as a surface-specific probe with high chemical selectivity was clearly accomplished.  This makes the reactive scattering technique unique and complementary to other techniques for investigating liquid surfaces.  Furthermore, significant new knowledge was gained about the nature of ionic liquid surfaces, including the surface segregation of different chemical functional groups, the relative smoothness of different surfaces, behavior of the surface of liquid crystals made from ionic liquids, and the ability to tailor an ionic liquid surface by using mixtures of such liquids.\n\n This project involved 6 senior faculty and supported three post-doctoral scholars and three graduate students.  Project outputs were seven refereed publications, 31 conference presentations, and one Ph.D. dissertation.  During the project period, related spin-off work led to the development of a hybrid organic/inorganic polymer blend and the demonstration of the atomic-oxygen resistance of this new material. There are many indications that this material would be an ideal drop-in replacement for the ubiquitous Kapton polyimide, which is used frequently on spacecraft in low Earth orbit but which is highly susceptible to degradation by atomic oxygen in the residual atmosphere of the Earth.  The success of the project provided the foundation for follow-on research in the UK and at Montana State University that is being funded independently in the two countries.  This ongoing research is refining reactive atom scattering as a liquid surface probe and is investigating gas uptake and catalysis at the ionic liquid-gas interface.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy K Minton"
