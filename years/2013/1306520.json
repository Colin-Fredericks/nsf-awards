 "awd_abstract_narration": "First-principles investigations of neutron and nuclear matter are at the forefront of research activities in nuclear physics and take ample advantage of the recent advances in high-performance computing. This project will lay the groundwork for finite-temperature studies of nuclear physics by pursuing the systematic study of strongly-coupled Fermi systems and by testing this approach with related few- and many-body problems in atomic physics. The numerical methods developed here focus on nonperturbative aspects of the nuclear many-body problem and the results are expected to impact other fields such as atomic and condensed matter physics, high-energy physics and astrophysics. The group will establish a database of Monte Carlo configurations that will serve the scientific community in the USA and abroad.\r\n\r\nThis project will promote an interdisciplinary study employing advanced first-principles calculations in several fields, ranging from nuclear physics to condensed matter and atomic physics. This will present unique opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to develop a broad understanding of various physical systems and perform creative multidisciplinary research. The database developed here will provide hands-on tools useful for teaching nonperturbative numerical methods for students worldwide. Education at the undergraduate level will benefit the local Computational Astronomy and Physics Research Experience for Undergraduates (CAP-REU) program.",

This kind of matter is special because interactions among particles play a crucial role, and because it is generically found in a wide range of situations in Nature. Those situations cover the very small (like quarks inside protons and neutrons, or in the lab-prepared ultracold atomic gases) to the very large (neutron matter in the high densities found inside certain stars).

This project studied matter constrained to 1D and 2D (comparing directly with ultracold atom experiments in the latter case and predicting the equation of state in the former), in the presence of spin polarization (in 1D and 3D) and mass imbalance (in 3D), in external traps (e.g. harmonic potentials and hard-wall containers), and for multicomponent systems (in 1D and 2D).

In many cases, those methods needed to be developed from scratch or imported from other areas [such as from the theory of strong interactions, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD)]. In particular, novel approaches for external trapping potentials were developed as part of this project (e.g. using non-uniform lattices for harmonic traps and Fourier acceleration for hard-wall potentials).
