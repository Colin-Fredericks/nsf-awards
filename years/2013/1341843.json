 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds travel for undergraduate students to present their reserach at the annual winter Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) and Mathematical Association of America (MAA) summer MathFest meeting for a five-year period beginning in 2014.  In 2014, the JMM will be held in Baltimore, MD from January 15 - January 18, and the MathFest meeting will be held in Portland, OR from August 7 - August 9.  A dramatic increase in the number of undergraduates participating in research in mathematics has occurred over the past twenty-five years. Consequently, contributed talks and poster presentations by undergraduates have become an integral part of the MAA summer MathFest and the winter JMM, organized by the MAA and the American Mathematical Society. Participation in such settings offers undergraduates the opportunity to become part of the mathematical community at a national level while interacting with both practicing mathematicians and peers. Learning new mathematics and sharing experiences with others can provide strong motivation for continued study of mathematics. Despite the positive effects of the experience, lack of travel funding remains a significant barrier to participation in national meetings for many students, particularly at institutions with large populations of underrepresented students. The proposed project will provide travel grants to nearly 1400 undergraduates over a five-year period, affording them the opportunity to present their work at MAA MathFest or the JMM, with priority in funding given to students from underrepresented groups and institutions with less funding.\r\n\r\nThe value of involving undergraduates in research is well documented and the potential benefits are numerous. Indeed, a growing body of literature suggests that participation in undergraduate research increases retention rates and student engagement and is beneficial for students from many backgrounds. Moreover, several studies have indicated that students who participate in undergraduate research are significantly more likely to attend graduate school than those who do not. Research has also shown, however, that the communication of results through oral or written presentations is an essential feature of an effective undergraduate research experience. The MAA, with its focus on advancing mathematics at the undergraduate level, provides a mathematically rich and diverse program at its annual meetings, making the JMM and MAA MathFest ideal venues for undergraduates to disseminate their research results while interacting with both peers who are similarly engaged in research and practicing mathematicians. The experience of participating in a national meeting, particularly the largest annual mathematics meeting in the world (JMM) and the largest summertime annual gathering of mathematicians (MAA MathFest), can help students identify with becoming a professional mathematician and may motivate them to continue the study of mathematics.  The proposed project will support increased engagement with mathematics and is expected to ultimately increase the number of students who pursue graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. Project results will be widely disseminated.",
