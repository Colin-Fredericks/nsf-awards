 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although many virtual organizations (VO) are quite effective, not all VO practitioners are effective in each area, and there is no organized body of knowledge or set of ?best practices? among VOs to draw upon for key issues. Therefore centers are likely not as effective as they could be. This proposal involves the creation of an online knowledge exchange.  This Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) would provide leaders of virtual organizations with resources about running virtual organizations and access to relevant organizational scientists. VORTEX is intended to aid in building a community among virtual organization leaders so that they can collaborate, share, and learn with and from each other. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives of the work include development, evaluation, and improvement of an online Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) environment to aid scientists and engineers to more effectively lead virtual organizations. This type of environment is necessary in order to: \r\n(1) Connect leaders of virtual organizations with appropriate organization scientists; \r\n(2) Provide online educational and reference materials for issues associated with managing virtual organizations; and\r\n(3) Establish a center for leaders of virtual organization to share and collaborate with each other.",
