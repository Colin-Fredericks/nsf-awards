 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe is made of unknown particles. Understanding the nature and properties of dark matter is fundamental for furthering the fields of cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics and for shaping our understanding of the makeup of the Universe. A leading theoretical candidate for this dark matter is a class of particles known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which would have been produced at the time of the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to detect these particles via their scattering from atomic nuclei have significantly matured and are possibly within a few years of making a definitive detection. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare WIMP interactions and distinguish them from backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide support for the continuation of the University of Florida's efforts in terms of supporting the operation and data analysis of the SuperCDMS Soudan experiment, performing detailed R&D into detector response to electron recoil backgrounds, both empirically and via simulation, and supporting the detector characterization and testing program for devices intended to be deployed in the proposed SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment at SNOLAB. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment has had a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical development will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry. This work will contribute to the training of graduate students, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies.",
