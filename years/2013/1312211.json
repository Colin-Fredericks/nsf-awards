 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating previously developed fundamental science to coat orthopedic implants made out of polymers with bioactive coatings. With the increasing clinical acceptance of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants, there is an urgent need in the industry to develop low-temperature coating processes. The translated biomimetic coating technology has several distinctive features. First, being a low temperature benign process, it is eminently suitable for coating polymeric substrates such as PEEK implants. Second, the process has the ability to produce carbonated-calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), similar in composition to bone mineral and a bioactive variation of inert hydroxyapatite. Third, unlike conventional biomimetic processes spanning over several weeks, the deposition of the coating takes place within a relatively short time frame of less than an hour, thus providing the ability for large scale industrial production. All of these features taken together make the technology more versatile than conventional coating processes. This project accomplishes the broad objective of fabricating the coatings and evaluating them for their physical, mechanical, and biomedical properties in vitro and in vivo; data essential to obtain approval from the various regulatory agencies, like the FDA. \r\n\r\nThis effort is a \"Win-Win\" situation for both the partners:  The University of Toledo and Orchid Bio-coat (Orchid) will work with the University of Toledo's Technology Transfer Office to bring the technology to market. The partnership engages Orchid to provide guidance to UT in the overall manufacturing, translation, distribution and further commercialization aspects that will introduce to the market a new generation of bioactive orthopedic implants made out of PEEK.  Orchid is one of the nation's largest providers of plasma sprayed coatings on titanium implants with their distribution network all across the globe.  However, with the switch from metallic to polymeric implants, UT will be able to provide the \"turn-key\" technology. The potential economic impact is expected to be felt within next three years' time frame, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this orthopedic implant space.\r\n\r\nThis project has a significant societal impact on the ageing \"Baby Boomers\" and an increasingly active general population.  These segments of the society, which are growing at a very fast rate, experience the most musculoskeletal diseases and injuries. This population is expected to require a wide variety of implants.  In the U.S., the orthopedic reconstructive device/implant market is presently experiencing an annual growth rate of 12 to 14%, which is even higher than that of the spinal implant market, growing at 10%.  This proposal will address this demand by developing improved and novel products with enhanced integration of the implant with the adjoining boney surfaces.  The effort will also train qualified manpower and will cater to the needs of implant manufacturers.",
