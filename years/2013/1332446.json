 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Tianbo Liu of Lehigh University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry for an International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) grant to develop rational methods for the synthesis of new type of nanoporous molecular capsules and investigate their complex interaction with counterions.  Polyoxometalate clusters with specific surface functionalities of the crown-ether type and a variety of porous Keplerate nanocapsules with tunable pore sizes and charges will be synthesized.  The new capsules will be used as model systems to explore their interactions with small counter-ions, counter-ion exchange and replacement, counter-ion transport over the membranes of Keplerate assemblies, and the nature of the surface water ligands on the capsules.  This work includes an international collaboration with Professor Achim M\u00fcller of the University of Bielefeld (Germany).  Professor M\u00fcller's work is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft German Research Foundation (DFG) of Germany.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide important knowledge for the design and preparation of new materials with catalytic, electronic, and magnetic properties.   The capsules synthesized may also serve as models for biological and bio-mimetic processes.  This project will, therefore, impact diverse areas (including chemistry, biological science, and materials science).  Furthermore, this international collaboration provides unique research environments for training students and postdoctoral researchers.",
