 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports the \"Conference on integrable systems, random matrix theory, and combinatorics\", which will take place at the University of Arizona, October 23-27, 2013. The goal of the conference is to foster interaction between researchers in integrable partial differential equations and researchers working in random matrix theory and combinatorics. The event is timely because integrable methods are now ready to have an impact on problems of graphical enumeration and newly discovered combinatorial identities make the rigorous proof of the full expansion of partition functions a reachable goal. The conference will include morning lectures on the most recent developments in random matrix theory and integrable systems, followed by afternoon workshops to investigate new research directions and collaborations in these areas. The majority of the participants will consist of junior researchers and graduate students. Information about the conference can be found at the conference website http://math.arizona.edu/mcl/CombConf.htm.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the conference is to promote research and education in the areas of partial differential equations and random matrix theory and combinatorics, and to bring together senior researchers, junior researchers and graduate students from two exciting active areas in mathematics with potential applications to mathematical biology and theoretical physics.",
