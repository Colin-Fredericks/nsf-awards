The conference is being held in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 2013.  PACT is a leading conference on parallel architectures, compilers, languages, algorithms, and applications.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.",
