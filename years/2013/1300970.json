Wind energy, an important source of clean and renewable energy, is becoming a major component of the U.S. energy portfolio.  The interest in large capacity wind turbines as an economical way to harvest wind energy has significantly increased in recent years.  Wind turbine blades are over 100m in length and the trend of increasing the size of the blades continues.  However, increases in the size of wind turbine blades means that aerodynamic vibrations need to be managed to prevent catastrophic failures.  The collaborative project team takes an innovative perspective to advance the smart turbine blade technology. The hypothesis of this research is that aerodynamic vibrations in wind turbine blades can be effectively mitigated with bio-inspired strategies for flow sensing, surface morphological change and fluid-structure interactions.  The specific goals of this research project are 1) to understand blade vibration dynamics with advanced modeling of fluid-structure interactions; 2) to study the mechanism of bio-sensing for flow turbulence determination and to implement a feasible sensor design strategy; and 3) to understand and emulate the functions of \"smart fins\" and \"smart denticles\" for aerodynamic vibration reductions. A systematic approach will be undertaken by combining modeling, sensing and actuation strategies. The smart blade system performance will also be validated via simulation-based virtual testing and reduced-scale model experiments. All of these aim to advance the state of art in the smart wind turbine blades.\r\n\r\nThis project presents a great opportunity to advance smart blade technologies, which include intelligent components for blade vibration reduction.  A unique bio-inspired strategy will be pursued to prevent catastrophic failures of wind turbine blades by effectively mitigating the aerodynamic vibrations.  The strategy will also improve the operational efficiency of the wind energy system.   All of these advances will have important impacts on the safe and efficient production of wind energy.",

The hypothesis of this research is that aerodynamic vibrations in wind turbine blades can be effectively mitigated with bio-inspired strategies for flow sensing, surface morphological change and fluid-structure interactions. The research work at Michigan Tech aims to design several types of aerodynamic control devices using smart material actuators to reduce the vibration fatigue load of wind turbine blades. The concepts of piezo stack actuator based smart external and internal flaps were detailed, including the basic flap layout, the operating range, the settings, etc. In addition, the Macro-Fiber composite based serrated microflap was also designed. In order to compensate the aerodynamic force, centrifugal force and gravitational force acting on the flap under the wind turbine&rsquo;s normal operational conditions, the required energy output from the actuators was calculated. To meet the energy requirements, the configuration of actuator array was determined. Amplification systems were designed to enhance the displacement output at the expense of the force output. In the meanwhile, a computational fluid mechanics-based numerical method was developed to evaluate aerodynamic characteristics of airfoil sections specifically intended for wind turbine applications, with attached modular flow-control. Numerical results provide the effects of slotted flaps applied to two airfoil sections, the NACA 643&minus; 618 and the DU 93-W-210, which are currently used on the NREL-5MWreference wind turbine. These analysis showed these modular devices could be appended to an existing blade design, providing a cost-effective method of active control with low energy of actuation. Following actuator design and aerodynamic characteristic studies, a universal flap control scheme was developed using the multiblade coordinate transformation, the gain scheduling technique and the proportional integral- derivative controller. A series of aeroelastic-aerodynamic time marching simulations were performed on the NREL 5MW wind turbine with the designed flap systems and control scheme in order to obtain the time responses. The time domain data was analyzed from a fatigue perspective. The result shows there are significant reductions in the vibration fluctuation and the damage equivalent loads, with respect to the blade out of-plane deflection and the blade root flapwise bending moment. To further investigate the effects of flap on the natural frequency of the wind turbine, the operational modal analysis was used to extract the modal parameters from the operating wind turbine. However, the operational modal analysis cannot be directly applied to the time series, which is because the assumptions are violated for the operating wind turbine and the harmonic frequencies raised from the rotational motion mask quantities of natural frequencies of the structural modes. In order to overcome this problem, a cepstral harmonic removal method was developed based on a mathematic development of a modified notch lifter. After the linearization direct eigenvalue analysis and the operational modal analysis were applied, both results show that the flap system slightly reduces the resonance frequencies.</p>\n<p>This project presents a great opportunity to advance smart blade technologies, which include intelligent components for blade vibration reduction.
