 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological conversion of cellulosic biomass into fuels and commodity chemicals is a sustainable alternative to present petroleum-based production platforms. Economic analyses indicate that substantial cost reductions can be achieved by integrating all required biological functions into a single bioreactor (termed consolidated bioprocessing). As a proof of concept, the PI has demonstrated direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol, a promising next-generation biofuel. Due to its efficiency, modularity, and robustness, the proposed microbial coculture technology platform has great commercial potential for cost-effective production of many other biofuels and valuable biochemicals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed platform could reduce processing costs for potential customers/partners by decreasing the number of reactors required and/or eliminating to the need to purchase hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the proposed system could enable customers/partners to transition from food-based to more abundant, sustainable, and lower-cost lignocellulose feedstocks.",

Through extensive market research and customer discovery, it was concluded that the technology has tremendous commercial potential due to its transformative power in reducing costs and tremendous flexibility which renders new products. Additionally, it was found that high-value biochemicals are promising market entry points for this technology. We further identified a biopolymer that can be synthesized cost-effectively through our microbial co-culture concept and has great potential in a wide variety of applications due to its unique properties such as super water absorbance.
