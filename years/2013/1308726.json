 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Weile Yan and Moira K. Ridley both at Texas Tech University who will investigate the surface chemistry of iron-enriched silica and alumina surfaces and their catalytic reactivity towards model contaminants in water. The researchers will take a multi-pronged approach to examine the surface and material chemistry of iron-enriched mineral surfaces using a suite of surface and solid characterization techniques, including HR-XPS, ATR-FTIR, TEM, AFM, and XRD. Additionally, solid-solution potentiometric titrations and surface complexation modeling (SCM) will be performed. This combination will establish an understanding of the surface coverage, nature of dispersion, chemical state, and coordination environment of iron attached to alumina and silica surfaces. Oxidative transformations of model contaminants mediated by these iron-enriched surfaces will be investigated. Findings from this study will provide fundamental insights into the relationship between surface chemistry and the reactivity of iron-impregnated alumina and silica surfaces and the role of these reactive interfaces in contaminant degradation and redox cycling.\r\n\r\nThe team will integrate research and education in two closely related disciplines, Environmental Engineering and Geosciences, by involving students in cross-disciplinary research and by introducing the topic of interfacial aqueous geochemistry in formal courses. Students will be trained in both experimental and computational techniques, thereby building a well-rounded foundation critically needed by the next generation of environmental professionals and educators. Additionally, outreach activities will extend to supporting university-sponsored summer science camps for girls in 5th through 11th grades, and providing students at Angelo State University (ASU), a minority-serving institution in the TTU system, an early exposure to ENVE and Geosciences trainings.",
