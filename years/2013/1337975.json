 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor K. Travis Holman and colleagues from Georgetown University will acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer without a detector since a state-of-the-art detector is currently available. The project is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of metal-organic and metal-organometallic framework (MOFs) materials; (b) molecular materials for gas separation and storage; (c) self-assembly and encapsulation chemistry, (d) crystal polymorphism; (e) pathogenic crystal growth; (f) crystalline explosives; (g) optically-switchable magnetic materials; (h) single-molecule magnets; (i) molecular materials catalytic intermediates for C-H bond functionalization; (j) bioinorganic modeling; (k) frustrated Lewis pair and NO-activation chemistry; (l) stereodynamic sensors; and (m) and asymmetric catalysis.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training and will contribute to educate students participating in activities such as the ACS project SEED and an NSF-supported REU program as well as undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal funding the purchase of an \"all-but-detector\" single crystal X-ray diffractometer to supplant--except for the detector and low temperature device--the formerly installed 1997 vintage Siemens SMART single crystal X-ray diffractometer at Georgetown University, which was already equipped with a state-of-the-art APEX-II detector (2008).\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The instrument secures the continued operation of the research programs of Holman (PI), Swift, Stoll, Warren, and Wolf in the department of Chemistry and enables important new, natural directions of these funded and impactful programs. This instrument supports the well-establish, largely NSF-funded, contemporary research, training, and teaching programs of these faculty and significantly enhances regional X-ray diffraction infrastructure.  Single crystal (and powder) X-ray diffraction is a primary, indispensable chemical/materials characterization technique and is of paramount importance for the advancement of research in many chemical and materials disciplines.  Thus, the funded instrument is employed in a variety of chemical/materials research projects, including novel synthetic organic, organometallic and materials chemistries, catalysis, porous material chemistry, inorganic materials science, nanoscience,  .  The scientific findings and results are diverse and there will be a myriad of impacts, and are outlined in the recent Products (e.g., publications, dissertations, conference presentations, patents) of these groups, and the research that will unfold for years to come. \n\nBroader Impacts:  Over 25 local Departmental Users (graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, staff) have been trained in the use of the funded instrument, spanning 6 different research groups.  The University has hired a full-time technical staff person to maintain the instrument and train and support Users of the instrument.  The instrument constitutes an integral component of the \"X-ray diffraction\" graduate (and undergraduate Honors) course slated that is now taught annually.  It is incorporated into our upper level undergraduate \"Chem-228: Synthesis\" class, offered annually.  With the aid of the supported instrument, we are developing the next generation of scientists with competence in materials-related techniques such as X-ray diffraction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: K.
