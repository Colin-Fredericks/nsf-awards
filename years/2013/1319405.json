 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research and development in cloud-based distributed systems is currently\r\nhindered due to the incredible difficulty of running such systems at\r\nscale. The Wisconsin Pocket Datacenter (PoD) project directly addresses this\r\ndilemma by enabling researchers and developers to run large-scale distributed\r\nsystems on modest hardware resources. The key novel idea behind PoD is data\r\nelision, which removes actual application data from the underlying disks,\r\nmemories, and network transfers of the distributed system under test. PoD thus\r\nenables many virtual instances of such a system to be run upon just a few\r\nphysical machines, thus making testing, debugging, and in general development\r\nsimpler, faster, and less resource-intensive.\r\n\r\nCloud-based distributed systems represent a critically-important piece of\r\nmodern computing infrastructure. As users and corporations migrate their data\r\nand computation into such facilities, it is increasingly important to ensure\r\nthat such systems operate correctly and efficiently. PoD enables developers to\r\ndebug existing systems and test new designs without excessive hardware\r\nresources; with such a tool in their workbench, system developers will be able\r\nto more readily build and test the next generation of cloud-based systems to\r\nsupport the needs of a growing percentage of society.\r\n",
