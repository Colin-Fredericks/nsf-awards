 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mathematics research project by Matthew Blair deals with Fourier analysis and its applications to partial differential equations.  Of particular interest here are space-time integrability bounds of Strichartz and local smoothing type for the wave and Schr\u00f6dinger equations.  The proposal also concerns closely related estimates on eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold.  These problems actually stem from those in classical Fourier analysis, such as the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem, and the relevant techniques involve closely related oscillatory integral estimates.  While basic formulations of these inequalities exist for these equations when they are posed over Euclidean space and even Riemannian manifolds without boundary, less is known about their validity for initial boundary value problems.  Here one considers a domain or more generally a Riemannian manifold with boundary, and the imposition of homogeneous boundary conditions affects the flow of energy in significant ways, sometimes even inhibiting dispersion.  Consequently, the proofs of these estimates typically involve microlocal or phase space analysis, which provide avenues for understanding this phenomena.  For smooth boundaries, Blair and his collaborators have achieved a great deal of success by realizing solutions as a superposition of wave packets, then showing that the resulting oscillatory integrals yield the desired inequalities.  On domains with corners, even less is known about the validity of these estimates, but Blair and his collaborators have been able to obtain some results for polygonal domains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mathematics research project by Matthew Blair is in the area of Fourier analysis: this is a branch of mathematics that plays an important role in the development of mathematical and physical theories.  The research pursued in this project provides the mathematical foundation for the study of light and sound waves. Fourier analysis continues to play a significant role in deepening our understanding of the equations which model this behavior.  In particular, these investigations yield further insight as to how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves.  For example, if one listens to the symphony in an auditorium, the sounds heard are affected by the manner in which the acoustic waves reflect off the walls.  In this sense, it can be important to understand how the shape of the hall influences its acoustics.  While this is of course a classical problem, there is more to be understood in terms of how these interactions influence dispersive properties.  Moreover, this line of work is important in the analysis of closely related nonlinear equations arising from fiber optics and water waves, where there is much to be done in understanding and limiting the various types of instabilities which can occur.",

Indeed, Fourier analysis  continues to play a significant role in deepening our understanding of  the equations which model wave behavior.  In particular, these  investigations yield further insight as to how the presence of a hard  boundary surface influences the development of waves.  For example, if  one listens to the symphony in an auditorium, the sounds heard are  affected by the manner in which the acoustic waves reflect off the  walls.

Moreover, this line of  work is important in the analysis of closely related nonlinear equations  arising from fiber optics and water waves, where there is much to be  done in understanding and limiting the various types of instabilities  which can occur. \n\nOther lines of research pursued here have close connections to  discplines such as quantum mechanics and quantum chaos.  In the analysis  of the time-independent Schrodinger equation, there has been interest  in \"scarring\" phenomena.  Scarring can loosely be described as the  tendency of a solution to concentrate its mass along a lower dimensional  set and hence has implications for the probabilistic interpretation of  the wave function.  The investigations of the PI have contributed  towards an understanding of when scarring can occur and a better  characterization of this sort of mass concentration.\n\n\nThe PI has been active in mentoring the diverse  student population at the University of New Mexico.  Under this grant, the PI's honors student, Stephen Pietromonaco, successfully defended his thesis.  The PI is currently mentoring a Ph.D. student, Chamsol  Park, and will be the advisor for his dissertation.  Prior to this grant, the PI advised two other graduate students.  All four students have worked on problems closely related to the PI's research.   Continued NSF funding has been vital in inspiring this research  program.\n\nThe PI has also developed graduate courses also related to his  research designed strengthen the graduate curriculum in mathematics at the University of New Mexico.   He also uses his base of mathematical experience obtained through  research to inspire the undergraduates in his courses to pursue  mathematics at higher levels.\n\nThe PI was also active in organizing conferences which educate and  inspire students in mathematical research.  This includes his activity  as a co-organizer of the New Mexico Analysis Seminar, which has  attracted a significant amount of interest within the analysis community  and deepens the connections between UNM and other institutions in the  state such as New Mexico State University.  In particular, the PI was  the lead organizer of the 2016 New Mexico Analysis Seminar, taking the  bulk of the organizing responsibilities from the scientific program to  arranging reimbursements for participants and working with the  accountants.  The PI has also co-organized special sessions at sectional  AMS meetings which have been successful.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Blair"
