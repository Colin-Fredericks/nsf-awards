 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this award is to support students/fellows and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) to attend the 2013 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference, to be held in Waimea, Hawaii from January 2 to 5, 2013. CMBE was recently created as a special interest group (SIG) within the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and represents a merger of the Society for Physical Regulation in Biology and Medicine (SPRBM) with BMES. This will be the first time that this conference is held as the primary meeting for the CMBE SIG, and BMES will provide enhanced exposure and membership. The specific theme of 2013 conference will be ?Gradient, Interfacial and Spatiotemporal Control of Cells and Tissues?. Within this central theme, a broad spectrum of isolated groups have converged from disparate disciplines, but without any sense of community. The need for this conference lies in the unique opportunity to bring these scientists together in one room for the first time to exchange ideas and brainstorm new spatiotemporal strategies for moving the field of regenerative medicine forward. This travel support opportunity will be advertised though emails to be sent out by BMES and CMBE as well as on the conference website. The application process will require a short abstract, an extended abstract and a resume/biosketch submitted via email sent to a specially created BMES email address. The selection committee will consider scientific merit, and previous accomplishments with special emphasis on promoting individuals from underrepresented groups and women scientists in the field. The selected students/fellows and Rising Stars will be expected to present during the conference. The Rising Stars will all present in a special session held on the first day of the conference.\r\nThe specific objectives of this award are two-fold. The first is to provide support to junior investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The meeting will thus provide a platform for the development of long-term interdisciplinary interactions, and expose researchers in bioengineering, biology and medicine to the latest ideas and opportunities at the confluence of CMBE. The second objective of this award is to foster the emergence and growth of the burgeoning sub-field of CMBE. \r\nThe outcomes of the conference will be published in a special issue of the journal of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering.\r\n",
