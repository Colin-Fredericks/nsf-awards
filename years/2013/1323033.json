 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is taking advantage of the previously-untapped synergy between extremely rapid microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) techniques and new pedagogical approaches to develop and evaluate a student-centered instructional approach for the sophomore-level organic laboratory. With the laboratory time gained through the use of MAOS, students now use a laboratory period for experimental design, analysis, debriefing, troubleshooting, and optimization, allowing for inquiry cycles that are both reflective of typical scientific practice and effective in promoting desirable cognitive outcomes. This approach has transformed organic laboratory instruction at Allegheny College, St. Mary's College, and Queensborough Community College, shifting the focus from verification to experimental design and collaborative construction of knowledge. Laboratory modules being developed and refined include an array of content designed for easy adoption and implementation, including student lab companion materials, pre-lab activities, and case studies; reagent and instrument prep sheets; instructor's guides; spectra of relevant compounds; and assessment rubrics. The project team is evaluating student thinking during lab, content learning, and attitudes toward science associated with the new instructional approach via analyses of pre- and post-treatment survey responses, classroom observations, student and faculty interviews, and student laboratory reports.",

QCC?s Goal in the Development of New Curriculum\n\nQCC has its advanced instrumentation (FT-NMR, FT-IR, UV-VIS spectrophotometers, SEM, HPLC) limited only for research (and not teaching) labs due to the expensive service contracts. Consequently organic lab students conduct standard experiments that involve no critical thinking. Microwave reactions reduce the reaction time and allow the development of an upgraded curriculum of experiments whereby students explore experimental concepts constructively while enhancing their lecture performance.\n\n \n\nTraditional Curriculum (before the project)\n\n\nThe Organic Chemistry lab syllabus consists of four standard technique and eight synthetic (Organic Chemistry I) and twelve synthetic experiments (Organic Chemistry II). The lab period starts with a pre-lab lecture/recitation on the chemistry, techniques and procedure loopholes and the students continue by following the pre-lab procedure. Thus, the students do not need to think constructively resulting in routine and limited outcomes.\n\n \n\n3.  Revised / Modified New Curriculum\n\nSome of the traditional curriculum experiments were modified to microwave-assisted labs which reduce reaction time while allowing the discussion of the important experimental concepts and expanding the students? conceptual approach of their obtained findings. Thus, in the \"Synthesis of Phenacetin\" (CH-251) and \"Synthesis of Acetanilide\" (CH-252) microwave modification procedures, students spend time to discuss (with partners first, then with other students) the details and provide their answers to the pre-lab.

This curriculum update allows the students to revisit and experience the concept application of thermodynamics in the lab which is normally assumed to be common knowledge to the students.\n\n \n\n4.  Result of New Curriculum\n\nIn the two revised synthesis lab experiments, each pair of students is assigned a set of reaction conditions (reaction temperature and time) and follow the procedure using a microwave reactor. Since the reaction temperature in the new curriculum is much higher than that employed in the traditional reflux reaction temperature, a much shorter reaction time is required for the revised lab compared to the traditional lab (five minutes instead of one hour), and students can execute several reactions using multiple reaction conditions. The obtained results of the reactions are compared to other students? findings, and this process provides them with a clear understanding of the effect of different reaction temperature and time needed to reach equilibrium. The revised \"thermodynamic study\" lab expands the student?s experience beyond the typical organic lab procedure.

Impact on the Community\n\nThe two microwave workshops at AC and SMCM over the last two years attracted the interest of several researchers. In addition, it was also found that the microwave technique was enhanced the interest of several academic scientists in various disciplines and institutions. In addition the newly formed \"Microwave Chemistry\" topical group of the ACS New York section (2016) will be a leading source of establishing the infrastructure in the area.
