 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop the next generation broadband millimeter-wave circulators integrated in CMOS using nano- and micro-hexaferrite materials operating in the 10 GHz to 100 GHz range. The proposed research objectives will be revolutionary in the emerging area of a low-cost, miniaturized millimeter wave devices and technology. The approach is based on micro- and nano-sized hexagonal ferrite crystalline with strong internal anisotropic magnetic field which can provide strong ferromagnetic resonance in the millimeter wave length without strong external magnetic field. The post-processing compatible with the standard state-of-art commercial CMOS process will be developed. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is the development of novel microstrip circulators and the innovative post-processing methods for complete system on-chip millimeter-wave integrated circuits in CMOS using micro- and nano-ferrite materials. A comprehensive characterization study will be performed to analyze the dielectric and magnetic properties of nano- and micro-ferrite. The study will expand the current body of knowledge on fundamental characteristic properties of micro- nano-size ferrites, and techniques to assemble unidirectional field ferrite layers on CMOS substrates. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this program include: (i) developing the high-frequency millimeter-wave circuits in low-cost silicon CMOS processes with ferrite materials which enable the realization of high-performance components for critical applications ranging from phased-array radar to wireless transceivers for military as well as for satellite communications; (ii) providing interdisciplinary training to students in ferrite material science, electromagnetic waves, millimeter wave circuits, semiconductor processing, as well as in application areas such as wireless network and radar, with a particular focus on inclusion of members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering; and (iii) enabling outreach by communicating to a wider audience,  the exciting interdisciplinary nature of the proposed device development and the research it will enable, through public lectures, websites, magazine articles, and undergraduate course material.",
