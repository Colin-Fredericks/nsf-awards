 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry and Chemical Measurement and Imaging Programs jointly support Professor Reginald M. Penner of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Irvine to investigate chemical sensors based upon metal nanowires. Three new modes for detecting molecules using metal nanowires are being developed in this project, which coincide with three objectives:  1) the use of surface electron scattering to detect gas phase molecules using noble metal nanowires. A specific example is a single gold nanowire that is capable of rapidly detecting 1 ppm NO2 and NO in air at elevated temperatures. 2) To exploit the heat of molecular chemisorption as means for detecting adsorbates in the gas phase using arrays of suspended metal nanowires. These investigations focus on ethylene on platinum and ethanol on palladium. 3) To create a family of nanoscopic chemical sensors based upon nanogaps in metal nanowires that are modified by the insertion of an affinity medium, such as a conductive organic polymer imprinted for the analyte molecule of interest, as well as a conductive polymer with incorporated antibodies during polymerization from solution. A broader impact of this research activity is a project involving outreach to economically disadvantaged high school students in the Santa Ana, California school district.  Each year this provides a student from Santa Ana High School ten weeks of full-time paid summer research in Professor Penner's laboratory.\r\n\r\nAs a chemical sensor is made progressively smaller, it responds more rapidly to changing concentrations of the molecule that is being measured.  In this project, a family of highly miniaturized chemical sensors are created using metal nanowires.  These nanowires are prepared using a process that is closely related to those used in the semiconductor industry to prepare integrated circuits.  The resulting nanowires, composed of gold, palladium, or platinum, are approximately 1/100th the diameter of a human hair, but of similar lengths on the order of millimeters or centimeters.  The electrical resistance of these diminutive wires increases when molecules attach to the surfaces of the wire, and this process provides a means for detecting these molecules very rapidly, within a few seconds.  The molecules that are being detected in these studies are nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons like methane and ethane.  In addition to a rapid response, a second advantage of these nanowire-based chemical sensors is their simplicity:  A chemical sensor consists of a single metal nanowire, two electrical contacts to this nanowire, and an instrument for measuring its electrical resistance.  Consequently, these sensors can be very inexpensive.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow does miniaturization down to the nanometer-scale influence the function and performance of chemical sensors?  This is the question we have attempted to answer in this NSF-funded project.  The key lessons we have learned from investigations on three types of chemical sensors are summarized below:\n\nCatalyze Hydrogen Sensors to Make Them Faster:  Because hydrogen gas (H2) is colorless, odorless, and highly flammable, sensitive and fast H2sensors are essential to the safe use of H2 in fuel-cell powered vehicles and other applications.  We have pioneered the use of nanowires composed of palladium (Pd) for the electrical detection of hydrogen.  When Pd nanowires are exposed to H2, the electrical resistance of the nanowires rapidly increases, and this resistance change can be used to reliably measure the H2 concentration across a huge range, from 5 parts-per-million to 1 percent.\n\nHydrogen sensors must be able to respond in seconds so it is extremely important to understand what attributes of a metal nanowire control its ability to respond rapidly to H2. H2 reacts with the Pd nanowires, and the rate of this reaction limits the rate at which a nanowire can detect the presence of H2. This understanding leads immediately to a new strategy for making them faster:  Put a thin layer of a catalyst for the H2 adsorption reaction on the surface of the Pd nanowire.  This works:  When we coat Pd nanowires with a layer of platinum metal just one atom in thickness, both the response to H2 and the recovery from H2 exposure are significantly accelerated.  This result shows very clearly that while small sensors, such as those based upon metal nanowires, can be faster than macroscopic sensors for gas sensing, the dimension of the sensor is not the whole story.  Accelerating the chemical reaction of the gas with the sensor surface is also critically important, and the use of catalysts can significantly accelerate response even at nanoscopic sensor surfaces.\n\nDetecting Cancer using Virus-Enabled Sensors:  In 2014, cancer surpassed heart disease to become the #1 cause of death in the U.S.  For all types of cancer - early detection dramatically improves the ability of doctors to effectively treat and potentially cure it.  We have been working to develop a disposable biosensor for the rapid detection of cancer in urine.  To accomplish this, we are developing sensors that can detect \"cancer markers\" - molecules that signal the presence of cancer &ndash; in urine.  Our technology exploits virus particles that function like hooks to recognize and attach to these cancer markers.  When they hook onto cancer markers, we use an electrical measurement to detection this process, allowing us to determine the concentration of the cancer marker in the urine and potentially, to more rapidly identify people who have cancer at their annual physical examinations.\n\nDuring the last three years, we have demonstrated that we can chemically modify virus particles to increase their affinity for cancer markers, enabling them to detection cancer markers that are present in urine at lower concentrations.  Using this new strategy, we have developed a biosensor that can detection prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a new and promising cancer marker for prostate cancer, directly in urine at a concentration of 1 nanomolar (nM).  This result has not been matched by any competing biosensor technology &ndash; to our knowledge.  These new results move us closer to the development of biosensors capable of using urinalysis to detect not only prostate cancer, but also cancers of the bladder and kidneys.\n\nPlastic Nanowires for Detecting Iron:  Molecules able to bind metal ions &ndash; called chelators &ndash; were discovered by the Swiss scientist Alfred Werner in the early 1900\u00c6s. We have asked the question:  How can chelators be exploited to build sensors capable of detecting metal ions?\n\nA new strategy is to prepare porous nanowires that are also able to conduct electricity.  ..."
