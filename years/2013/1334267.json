 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop and maintain an interactive web portal, TheDesignExchange, to facilitate the capture, analysis and widespread use of methods for conducting design research. The study of design has been shown to have high impact on the quality and success of engineered products. However, design research does not fall into a single disciplinary body of knowledge, and TheDesignExchange fills a need to organize disparate design research methods, develop a community of design educators and practitioners to evaluate those methods, and educate the next generation of design innovators. TheDesignExchange provides a structure to collect the many design methods in use today, their origins, and use.  It also will match design methods to design problems and help designers make informed decisions about when to apply these methods.  The portal supports the entire design process, providing educators and practitioners alike with a versatile library of proven tools. \r\n\r\nTheDesignExchange aims to be the largest public library of design research methods. The methods cover a wide range of communities and applications, including, for example, methods most effective for design for under-served communities. Faculty, undergraduates and graduate students of diverse backgrounds and heritage participate in this research, as well as practitioners and leaders from industry, non-profit and government design groups. The researchers leverage knowledge gained from TheDesignExchange to identify and teach the underlying skills associated with the various methods, providing recent graduates a more fluid understanding of how, why, and when to apply specific design research methods.",

A myriad of methods for design have been developed from both practice and academia for every stage of the design process, from understanding the needs of users to generating ideas to evaluating design concepts.

TheDesignExchange was created to serve as an online portal for students, practitioners, and the general public to learn about this broader set of design methods and how to best apply them to problems.

We found that users favor a variety of content to enable them to learn new methods, including text, short videos, and case examples that illustrate how the method has been applied in other contexts. Based on this understanding, we created new, appropriate content for teaching design methods. To understand how users engage with the portal, we observed and interviewed users in a laboratory setting as they engaged in pre-defined tasks on theDesignExchange, as well applied design methods on their own. Results showed that design students had been previously exposed to only a few key design methods, and were not at all familiar with many of the methods available on theDesignExchange. They were able to successfully apply several unfamiliar design methods to a variety of design problems without difficulty. More importantly, they valued the opportunity to learn new strategies for designing and expand their skillset in design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maria&nbsp;C&nbsp;Yang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
