 "awd_abstract_narration": "All known clams of the Lucinidae family harbor chemosymbiotic bacteria that fix carbon and supply it to their hosts in the absence of sunlight. Because lucinids are very abundant in shallow marine sediments, their effects on porewater composition, nutrient suspension, sediment biogeochemistry and vegetation productivity are considerable. However, their roles in sediment N and methane cycling are unknown, especially compared to other chemosymbiotic systems in deep-marine settings. Moreover, it is unclear how a decline in lucinid populations and/or functional diversity may impact coastal biome and ecosystem services, or even what could lead to lucinid population declines overall. This project will investigate the underexplored genetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity of lucinid chemosymbioses in shallow marine environments ranging from pristine to highly altered. Sampling will take place in Florida, California, and The Bahamas. The investigators will also test for ways to characterize lucinid-bacteria biodiversity in the geologic past. This research is expected to fill gaps in our understanding of lucinid chemosymbiotic systems, including how gene expression is altered for lucinids and their endosymbionts in changing ecosystem conditions, particularly due to anthropogenic impact.\r\n\r\nThis research will fill a major gap in understanding lucinid biodiversity loss that may occur in habitats sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances and will be important for coastal resource management decisions. The researchers will provide interdisciplinary training in geochemistry, microbiology, and paleobiology to graduate and undergraduate students, including field studies in The Bahamas, training in museum collection standards, laboratory research, and computational bioinformatics. Students from underrepresented STEM groups will be involved on the project, and involvement with university outreach and mentoring programs will target symbiosis and biodiversity topics through formal and informal classroom, public speaking opportunities, and museum activities.",

Chemosymbiosis is when a host animal is intimately dependent on microbial symbionts, which live in host tissues, for nutrients and potentially habitat detoxification. Lucinids are the most taxonomically diverse group of chemosymbiotic bivalves, and all lucinids examined to date have chemosymbiotic bacteria that are acquired from the environment. Because lucinids can be extremely abundant in sediments (up to 1000 per cubic meter), they affect porewater composition, nutrient suspension, sediment biogeochemistry and vegetation productivity. Their roles in sediment carbon, including methane, and nitrogen cycling are poorly understood. Moreover, the genetic underpinnings of lucinid and chemosymbiotic bacterial diversity in shallow marine ecosystems have remained largely unexplored for many coastal marine habitats and have been limited to only a few hosts worldwide. As such, it is unclear how a decline in lucinid populations and/or functional diversity may impact coastal biome and ecosystem services, or even what could lead to lucinid population declines within a system.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Lucinid-bacteria chemosymbiotic associations are an ideal system to unify the dimensions of biodiversity. The main goals of this project were to uncover the genetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity of modern lucinid chemosymbiosis and to test for ways to characterize lucinid chemosymbiosis biodiversity in the geologic past. Because lucinids have an extensive fossil record, geologic time is a \"4th dimension\" of biodiversity that can reveal more about the evolutionary history of lucinid chemosymbiosis. The research objectives were to determine (1) how lucinid taxonomy, habitat, and biogeography influence endosymbiont genetic diversity, (2) how the microbial diversity and ecology of the lucinid habitat affect symbiont diversity, distribution, and biogeochemical cycling, (3) how lucinid host morphology may serve as a proxy for the presence of endosymbionts and/or degree or type of symbiotic dependence in fossil taxa, and (4) how disturbances (e.g., anthropogenic activities) within the coastal biome affect the nature and type of lucinid chemosymbiotic association.</p>\n<p>Lucinid populations were sampled in the Western Atlantic and Caribbean. Examined habitats included organic-rich sediments from seagrass beds and mangroves from shoals and estuaries, respectively, as well as from algae-dominated sediment and anchialine systems. Thus far, the following conclusions can be drawn from this research: (1) lucinid endosymbionts are genetically and taxonomically more diverse than previously considered; (2) lucinid-symbiont associations are not species-specific and taxonomically heterogeneous; (3) lucinid endosymbiont function is not limited to chemosynthesis based on solely cycling sulfur compounds; and (4) novel lucinid populations record a dynamic evolutionary history through time. Specifically, a genetically distinct endosymbiont genus and species was identified from the lucinid host <em>Phacoides pectinatus</em>, which extends the previously known diversity of endosymbionts. This host?s microbiome was also found to be more diverse than previously known, and comprised of bacteria from the order Oceanospirillales and the phylum Spirochaetes whose functional capabilities are still being explored. From another lucinid host, <em>Ctena orbiculata</em>, endosymbionts expressed genes capable of one-carbon oxidation, which had been unrecognized and undescribed in lucinids previously. Lastly, 11 distinct lucinid host species from the Lucininae, Leucosphaerinae and Codakiinae subfamilies were examined and the possibility exists, although this is still an area of active research, that new species of lucinids were discovered from a unique, previously unexplored habitat, specifically anchialine systems that formed in the geologic past and have been functionally isolated from the open ocean for thousands of years. Lucinids living in these relict habitats provide important information about how gene expression is altered for lucinids and their endosymbionts in changing ecosystem conditions.</p>\n<p>The project provided interdisciplinary training in geochemistry, microbiology, marine ecology, molecular genetics, and paleobiology to Masters- and PhD-level graduate and undergraduate students, and included field studies in The Bahamas and training in museum collection standards, laboratory research, and computational bioinformatics. Students had the opportunity to conduct fieldwork, to learn key experimental design and field sampling approaches, and to gain professional development experience by giving research presentations and from scientific writing. More than half of the students involved on the project, from all the collaborating institutions belong to first-generation and/or underrepresented STEM groups. Outreach and mentoring programs targeted symbiosis and biodiversity topics through formal and informal classroom, public speaking, and museum opportunities.
