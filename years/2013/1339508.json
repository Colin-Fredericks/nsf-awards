 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in an expanding number of scientific disciplines, ranging from astronomy to medicine and from economics, to botany, would like to move large volumes of data across institutional and national boundaries. Placing data at different locations expands data processing capacity, facilitates collaborative analysis and accelerates translation of gained insight into scientific discoveries. Yet, we have little understanding of how a complex ensemble of interrelated factors affect the cost, performance, and resource consumption of these data movements. Factors include the number and size distributions of files in a data set, performance characteristics of the source and destination file/storage systems, time-of-day/week fluctuations of the network carrying capacity between sites, availability of IPv6 paths.  This  project will explore models that capture both the characteristics and interplay of facets that are involved in placing data at locations separated by local, national, or international networks. Exploratory work will take place to establish organizational and functional foundations for an international data placement laboratory (iDPL) to support at-scale end-to-end data placement experiments.\r\n\r\nThe iDPL will be constructed with international partners and is intended to be an extensible facility.  The UCSD and UW-Madison team bring together extensive experience in software tools (HTCondor, Open Science Grid, Rocks Clustering), high-performance campus-area networks (Quartzite and Prism@UCSD), storage systems (Data Oasis), and engaged science communities.  The iDPL core software architecture is to treat data placement experiments as workflows and then use HTCondor?s DAGMan and Metronome continuous testing framework to author, instantiate and manage experiments.   Synthetic data sets will be offered to facilitate diagnostics.  Whenever possible, international networking providers will be engaged to correlate infrastructure view of the network with user experiences.\r\n\r\nThe broad and long term impact is to lay the groundwork for a persistent, data and information sharing vehicle that can be easily expanded beyond the initial international group of institutions",

Ideally, one would like to be able to predict how much time each of the three steps will consume.\n\nThe international data placement laboratory (iDPL) represents a prototype for regular measurement and understanding of data placement using a variety of data transfer technologies and algorithms.  The approach for iDPL was to enable a system that could test both raw network performance (like perfSONAR) and easily incorporate different algorithms for disk-to-remote-disk copy performance. Over years of measurement, some data placement is limited by raw network performance, while other placement is limited by disk performance.  Routine tests among  four anchor institutions of the iDPL: University of California, San Diego, University of Wisconsin Madison, Chinese Academy of sciences, Beijing and Beihang University, Beijing could capture limitations due to distance, firewall traversal problems, and periodic (regular) performance degradation all withiin the context of national and international networks. iDPL has also been extended for routine tests to two commercial cloud providers: Amazon AWS and Google Compute Engine.\n\niDPL is open source and uses the widely-deployed HTCondor system for orchestration of repeated tests.  Internally, a data placement is an abstraction that moves data from a source to a destination.  The data may be \"in memory\", which allows iDPL to easily handle network-only tests.  Data can also be disk-resident, but the protocol utilized to effect the transfer can change. iDPL supports so-called \"data movers\" that include: raw socket (netcat), secure copy (SCP), explicitly parallel (FDT from the Monalisa project and GridFTP from Globus), and udp-only (UDT).   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.  iDPL provides the mechanics to set up server processes (like a user-space secure shell daemon) for the duration of a single test event and then tear it down.
