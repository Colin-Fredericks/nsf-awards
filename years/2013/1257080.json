 "awd_abstract_narration": "The order Zingiberales is a diverse group of economically and ecologically important tropical plants including banana, gingers, bird-of-paradise, and canna. This project examines the genetic, morphological, and ecological evolution of Zingiberales over geologic time scales. Morphological data from living and fossil species will be combined with DNA data to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among species and the timing of important evolutionary events. The geographical distribution of living and fossil species and changes in their ecology through time will then be examined to understand how these plants have adapted to different regions and climates through time. \r\n\r\nThe integration of multiple lines of evidence from fossil and modern data is needed in order to understand evolutionary drivers and responses, current and historic biodiversity, and how modern ecosystems have been formed; all of which give us insight to the current patterns of biodiversity and the ability to predict future evolutionary patterns and ecosystem processes. The Zingiberales serve as a model for this type of study due to their ecological importance today and the presence of an extensive fossil record. In addition, because they are tropical and subtropical plants, they will help us understand the biology of a warming world.",

Zingiberales are a diverse group of primarily tropical plants, including several economically important edible (e.g., ginger, cardamom, bananas) and ornamental species (e.g., canna, bird-of-paradise, prayer plants). The integrative analysis and synthesis of deep-time and recent data was important to understand evolutionary drivers and responses in the group and assembly of ecosystems over time. We were able to resolve the affinities of eight species of fossil leaves and 10 species of fossil seeds better using a comprehensive dataset of &gt;200 species each of leaf and seed structure for modern Zingiberales and their closest related group, Commelinales. Seed anatomy was studied using the novel application of X-ray tomography data, which permitted acquisition of a large comparative dataset and demonstrated that these are some of the most diverse and complicated seeds in all of flowering plants. While there has been uncertainty in the affinities of these fossils, we were able to place them confidently in the true gingers, family Zingiberaceae, and to recognize that they are more similar to each other than to certain living species, and thus represent an extinct lineage. Using these fossils in analyses to date the family tree for Zingiberales, we demonstrated that the family is older than previously thought. In addition, our new dataset better resolves the relationships between families and highlights that there was rapid early evolution in the group. The work we produced shows the value of incorporating morphology and fossils into phylogenetic analyses and not using fossils just as age constraints for specific parts of a phylogeny. The dated phylogeny that is produced will be used to evaluate drivers of evolution within the group. Further, compilation of the fossil record shows that most fossils belong to Zingiberaceae, and families have an ancient distribution that includes mid- and high-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia ? further north and including different regions than would be reconstructed if using only today?s primarily pan-tropical distributions of the group.
