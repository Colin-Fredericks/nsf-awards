The requested new generation FACSAria III is capable of sorting four different types of cells and analyzing nine fluorescence markers simultaneously. Its rates of analysis and sorting are 75,000 events/second and 25,000 cells/second, respectively, with 98% of purity. This rapid sorting capability will significantly improve cell survival rate and reduce the chances of cell contamination. Access to this state-of-the-art flow cytometer and cell sorter will have an immediate and tremendous impact on UA researchers and students. Since flow cytometric analysis of cell types and further sorting them based on their properties are absolute pre-requisites for performing high-quality life science and biomedical research, FACSAria will propel UA?s recent health research initiative, boost faculty research capabilities in the newly-formed biomedical engineering department, and help more individuals on campus obtain preliminary results to seek NSF or NIH funding.",
