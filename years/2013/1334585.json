Scholarship on the demographic composition of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math workforce (STEM) tends to focus only on gender, asking why women are underrepresented in STEM fields. Women's low participation in these fields is often conceptualized as a failure of the fields to attract women, either due to the subject matter or difficulty in balancing work and family life. Using only a gendered lens obscures the complicated racial and global demographic dynamics of the STEM workforce, particularly in IT. This research uses an intersectional framework to analyze gender, race, and migration together, shedding new light not just on women's representation but more broadly on how gender, race and migration operate in a high-tech field with global markets for both labor and goods. Using a mixed-method approach, this study examines the consequences of race, gender and migration status for IT workers' workplace experiences and wages. It asks the following questions: 1) What is the magnitude of unequal representation in IT when considering the intersections of gender, race, and migration? 2) Is the unequal representation by demographic group accompanied by unequal wages? 3) What differences exist in the experiences of workers across race, gender, and migration status? Descriptive demographic analysis shows the magnitude of unequal representation by gender, race, and migration status. Wage decomposition provides a quantitative analysis of differences in earnings across demographic groups and shows how much of those differences results from unequal treatment. Qualitative analysis of single gender, race, and migration status focus groups and interviews examines differences in workers? experiences to understand the causes and consequences of wage and representational inequalities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project makes significant contributions in three important areas: 1) It advances sociological understandings of how inequality persists and operates when discrimination has been disavowed and creating opportunities for historically underrepresented groups is a spoken goal 2) It corrects misunderstandings about the demographics of the IT workforce that have resulted from a nearly exclusive focus on gender 3) It offers a new approach to understanding the challenges of broadening participation initiatives in STEM, which will generate new strategies for recruiting a diverse STEM workforce.",

I conducted interviews with tech workers, observations from tech conferences and &ldquo;hack-a-thons,&rdquo; and nationally representative quantitative workforce data from the American Community Survey to examine the consequences of race, gender, and immigration for tech workers&rsquo; experiences and wages. While previous research shows a decrease in the proportion of women in tech work, these conclusions are somewhat misleading as they do not consider the intersections of race and migration with gender. I find only modest change in the absolute numbers of women. Rather, as the field grew, male migrant workers have primarily filled the new positions. Using only a gendered lens obscures the complicated racial and global dynamics of the tech workforce. Women&rsquo;s declining representation presents a puzzle that must be understood in the context of the field, where work is highly mobile, teams may be made up of members from around the world, certain specialized skills are in high demand, and notions of flexibility and innovation loom large for both workers and companies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I empirically examine three aspects of tech worker&rsquo;s experience. First, I look at differences in wages by gender, race, and immigration status using decomposition techniques. I find that, despite the investment in recruiting women, there is a considerable wage gap that reflects the intersecting race, gender, and immigration inequalities. These wage gaps persist even after controlling for demographic, human capital, and job-related variables. Second, I explore the kinds of work that tech workers do. Drawing from 45 interviews, I find that even women with advanced technical training tend to do work that emphasizes stereotypically feminine skills, such as communication. Many of the mid-career women I interviewed hold positions that I call &ldquo;translational&rdquo; as they are expected to translate technical information to management and business directives to technical teams. Finally, I examine what tech workers value in their jobs. Many workers emphasized aspects of autonomy and independence, including scheduling their own time, avoiding micro-managers, or feeling free to take a new job if a better opportunity arose.
