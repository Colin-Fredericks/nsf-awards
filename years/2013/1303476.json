 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this research is to study and develop a novel high-power (watt-level), widely tunable, compact 3.5-4 micron laser source. The approach is based on a novel intra-cavity collinear type-II difference frequency generation (DFG) in a two-chip T-cavity vertical external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL). Wavelength tuning of each chip around the gain maxima will result in high power wide wavelength tuning in the mid-IR band. The proposed high quality factor doubly-resonant laser cavity will open doors to a new class of high power semiconductor-based mid- to far-IR lasers and will have a transformative effect in various fields of science. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research is to develop a new class of high-power, compact, widely-tunable mid-IR laser sources. Significant research and technical advancement will be made in areas such as: semiconductor laser and cavity design, nonlinear optical materials, thermal management, and difference frequency conversion. The proposed intra-cavity DFG in a two-color doubly-resonant VECSEL cavity will open doors to a new class of high power semiconductor-based mid- to far-IR lasers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed mid-IR source will have significant future scientific impact on various fields of science and engineering and multi-disciplinary education and outreach. In addition to the application-rich mid-IR, the proposed concept can be extended to the untapped spectral regions in the far-IR providing even more research opportunities in the future. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will provide powerful and unique educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate and underrepresented minority students.",
