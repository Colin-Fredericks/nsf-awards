 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and dynamics of the lowermost 400-km depths of the mantle are believed to have strong influences on the chemical evolution of our planet.  Deep subducting slabs appear to transport materials formed at the surface of the Earth to this deepest part of the mantle and hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, may have their roots in this deepest part of the mantle.  Seismologists have documented a discontinuous increase in shear wave velocity at 400-km above the base of the mantle.  Recent studies have proposed that this seismic discontinuity may be related to a phase transition in the dominant mantle silicate perovskite (post-perovskite transition), implying that the lowermost mantle has the same composition as the shallower mantle layers.  Yet, studies to date have focused on simplified systems.  Our recent study incorporating the effects of iron and aluminum [Catalli et al., 2009, Nature], which is more realistic for the mantle, showed that the post-perovskite transition cannot explain the seismic discontinuity if the lowermost mantle has the same composition as the shallower mantle layers.  \r\n\r\nUnder this grant, we will conduct measurements on the seismic detectability of the post-perovskite transition in rocks that may constitute the mantle, i.e., pyrolite, harzburgite, and basalt, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell at in situ high pressure-temperature conditions related to the lowermost mantle.  The aim of the proposed research is to explore compositions which may have a seismically detectable post-perovskite transition.  Our proposed study will therefore provide important constraints on the chemical composition and mineralogy of the lowermost mantle.  One of the most important improvements in the proposed research over previous measurements is the focus on understanding the effects of other mantle phases, such as ferropericlase, silica, CaSiO3 perovskite, and the calcium-ferrite-type phase, on the seismic detectability of the post-perovskite transition through the partitioning of iron and aluminum. Our preliminary work on pyrolite, basalt, and San Carlos olivine reveal that the multi-phase effects can change the detectability of the post-perovskite transition significantly and the post-perovskite transition may be more detectable in differentiated compositions (harzburgite and basalt) than homogenized mantle composition (pyrolite).  Therefore, the proposed measurements will allow us to investigate the possible existence of differentiated recycled materials at the lowermost mantle.  This would have significant impacts on the geochemistry and dynamics of the lowermost mantle and geochemical signatures of the root of hot spot volcanoes which have been attributed to the lowermost mantle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt 3000-km depth from the surface of the Earth, solid rocks in the mantle are in direct contact with liquid iron in the outer core (core-mantle boundary).  Geophysicists and geochemists have believed that a lowermost 400-600 km region above the core-mantle boundary may play important roles in mantle dynamics which strongly couples with geological processes on the surface of the Earth, such as earthquakes and volcanic activities.  Indeed, seismic studies for more than 3 decades have revealed complex structures in the lowermost mantle region.  The complexity of the lowermost mantle region has often compared with the complexity found near surface, and may be the greatest in the whole mantle.  Two very large-scale low shear velocity provinces in the lowermost mantle region may be responsible for the hot spot volcanism, such as Hawaii and Iceland, and contain the oldest materials preserved since the formation of the solid mantle about 4 billion years ago.  Very thin small scale structures found in the region have extremely low velocity, suggesting possible melting of mantle materials in the region and reaction of mantle materials with liquid iron in the outer core.  Such processes could affect the dynamics of the core and possibly the magnetism from the core.  Yet, the origins of the complex structures are still under intense debate. \n\nIn the lowermost mantle region, seismologists have found an abrupt increase in seismic velocities (D\" discontinuity).  Not only the depth of the discontinuity varies laterally, but also it develops into multiples of discontinuities in some regions in the lowermost mantle.  The discontinuity and its behavior have been explained by a phase transition in the dominant mineral in the lower mantle (post-perovskite transition).  However, it has been debated if the post-perovskite transition would be observed as an abrupt change (discontinuity), as found in seismology, or as a gradual change (gradient), unlike the seismic observations.  Through a series of high pressure experiments at synchrotron facilities, we showed that the velocity change of the post-perovskite transition can be abrupt enough for seismic detection if the transition occurs in the composition related to basalt which is transported from the surface to the lowermost mantle.  In addition, we found that some complex behaviors may not be entirely explained by the post-perovskite transition.  Instead, we found that the basaltic materials transported from the surface to the lowermost mantle can have two phase transitions in the region, i.e., the post-perovskite transition and the silica phase transition.  We collaborated with seismologists to explore the evidence of such discontinuity structures in the region.  The most notable contribution we made through this project is to demonstrate that the compositional variation may be an important factor to consider for the origins of the complexity in the lowermost mantle.  Our laboratory results will impact future studies in seismology, geophysics, and geochemistry of the dynamically critical region in the mantle.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sang-Heon Shim"
