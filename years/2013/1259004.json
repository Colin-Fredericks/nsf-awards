 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is part of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime, characteristic cross-lake fetch and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this sub-group will focus on \"short-fetch\" events in which prevailing low-level winds are oriented at large angles relative to Lake Ontario's long axis.  These investigators will seek to advance process-oriented understanding of atmospheric boundary-layer circulations over adjacent complex land cover, factors controlling the location and downwind persistence/spatial extent of lake-effect circulations and associated bands of heavy snowfall, as well as those precipitation events associated with smaller bodies of water as are found in the Finger Lakes region.  Observational assets to be deployed during OWLeS will include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other surface measurement systems.  The intellectual merit of this sub-group's activities is centered upon determination of (1) how upwind land-surface and atmospheric factors determine the three-dimensional structure of the short-fetch convective LeS PBL that develop over a relatively-warm, open water surface; (2) how organized, initially convective cloud and precipitation structures under short-fetch conditions persist far downstream over land, long after leaving the buoyancy source (i.e., the ice-free waters of Lake Ontario); and (3) factors controlling the development of, and interactions between, complex atmospheric stratifications embodying a internal planetary boundary layer and residual layers resulting from airmass advection over multiple mesoscale bodies of water and intervening land.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of OWLeS will include improved physical understanding and model-based representations of conditions that impact populations and associated major transportation corridors along the shores of the Great Lakes region, as well as extensive opportunities for enhanced classroom and hands-on field project based educational opportunities for a large number of students who will be actively engaged in field campaign planning, instrument preparation, data collection and analysis.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.",

Forecasts of lake-effect storms in the Great Lakes region has improved, but predicting snow amounts, wind circulations leading to specific types of storms, and the movement of the storms over time is difficult. Such forecast weaknesses are due in part to a lack of over-lake observations of lake-effect storms needed to develop, evaluate, and improve the mathematical models used to produce forecasts.</p>\n<p>The Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field project was conducted to collect detailed observations of the structure and evolution of Lake Ontario lake-effect storms, both over the lake and in surrounding regions. These observations were collected by water surface, airborne, balloon, and remote sensing instruments. OWLeS was headed by the University of Illinois in close collaboration with nine other universities/research institutions. OWLeS was funded through three collaborative grants, each with separate scientific objectives. The grant described in this document was designed to determine how the lowest portions of the atmosphere (the atmospheric boundary layer) change as the air moves over alternating land and water surfaces and, in turn, how these changes affect lake-effect snow.</p>\n<p>Using the unique observations available in OWLeS, we were able to document how wintertime lake-effect processes over Lake Erie can greatly increase the intensity of the lake-effect snows over Lake Ontario. On January 28, 2014, lake-effect clouds and snow developed over a nearly ice-covered Lake Erie. As the clouds and snow crossed over a portion of New York State and then neared the southwestern shoreline of Lake Ontario, they suddenly weakened, creating a zone of cloud-free air. This zone was caused by a region of air forced down by increasing near-surface wind speeds as the air moved from land to the flatter water surface.</p>\n<p>OWLeS observations show that the atmospheric boundary layer that filled with clouds and snow over Lake Erie intensified the lake-effect snow over Lake Ontario, despite the clear-air zone between them. Lake-effect clouds over Lake Ontario within the plume of air modified by Lake Erie were larger, the snowfall rates were much greater, and the strength of the turbulent updrafts and downdrafts was greater than outside of the plume. Our interpretation is that weak upward and downward air motions that crossed the Lake Ontario coast persisted, but became smaller, followed by subsequent rapid increases in their strength over the open waters of the lake. The combination of these strengthened motions and persistent snow particles allowed the Lake Ontario lake-effect system to strengthen much more quickly.</p>\n<p>A follow-up graduate-designed study used the University of Illinois Halo Doppler Lidar system to examine variations of the atmospheric boundary layer at the Lake Michigan western coast during a lake-effect snowstorm. We observed considerable variations in the depth and strength of the air motions, depending on the time of day, characteristics of the land surface upwind of the coast, wind speed, and atmospheric stability. The link between these differences and lake-effect snowfall intensity is being investigated.</p>\n<p>The OWLeS observational data provided valuable insights into how lake-effect storms evolve and are influenced by upwind land and water surfaces. The work emphasizes the need to better understand how the ?clear-air? zone and upwind atmospheric boundary layer influence the intensity of lake-effect snow. Our research and those of the other OWLeS participants identified several surprising characteristics of lake-effect snowstorms. This information has been used to evaluate and improve the ability of mathematical atmospheric models used to forecast lake-effect storms. In addition, OWLeS provided a greater understanding of the rapid changes in the atmospheric boundary layer over uneven surfaces. These changes influence the spread of pollutants and plant materials. Finally, the project contributed to educational materials and experience for undergraduate and graduate students, adding to their excitement and understanding of the scientific process.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/22/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kristovich</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259004/1259004_10234682_1563816243838_ProjectOutcomesReport-firstfigure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259004/1259004_10234682_1563816243838_ProjectOutcomesReport-firstfigure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lake-effect Snowstorm Conditions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259004/1259004_10234682_1563816243838_ProjectOutcomesReport-firstfigure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lake-effect Snowstorm Conditions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo illustrating dangerous road conditions during OWLeS.
