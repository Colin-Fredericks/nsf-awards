 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project will be to study theoretically and computationally quasilinear dispersive partial differential equations related to Hamiltonian models in mathematical physics from nonlinear optics, water waves, many body quantum systems and plasma physics.  The equations of interest come from families of Schr\u00f6dinger, Dirac, Korteweg-de Vries, and gravity-capillary wave equations.  In addition, the PI hopes to continue to explore the strongly nonlinear effects relating to frequency cascades in Hamiltonian models on compact domains.  The bulk of the project will focus on understanding theoretically the existence and regularity of solutions to strongly nonlinear models, as well as studying local and global dynamics of special solutions within these complex models.  However, a component will also consist of using modern functional analytic techniques to study convergence of numerical methods and to study validity of discrete approximations to these models.  Such analysis can serve as motivation for dynamics, as well as a means of testing asymptotic limits where direct analysis may no longer predict precise dynamics.  In addition, the PI will work to develop a functional analytic framework for studying stability under stochastic perturbations of quasilinear models and computational approximations.\r\n \r\n \r\nQuasilinear partial differential equations arise in models where curvature has a strong influence on the underlying physics.  Hence, surface tension in fluids, surface energy in crystals or relativistic effects in optics can introduce interaction terms that strongly depend upon higher order derivatives of the solution.  It is the aim of this project to shed light on in what sense these models have solutions and in particular understand precise asymptotic descriptions of the solutions when possible.  Capillary waves might be useful for measuring the surface signature of internal water waves, crystal relaxation plays a role in semiconductor fabrication and ultra-short pulse lasers have appeared in many recent physics applications and plasma generation.  From a human resources standpoint, quasilinear problems provide a large pool of problems that can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  In particular, undergraduates can learn some of the innate difficulties in quasilinear equations by numerically analyzing simple 1,2-dimensional toy-model systems, graduate students can learn the functional analysis framework and develop the techniques through applications to reduced models or critical equations, and postdocs can collaborate on projects to fully explore the models, develop techniques and work towards optimal results in stability theory and phenomenology.  Such approaches give trainees and the PI a broad class of analytic and computational tools to use for solving many interesting problems, allowing them to work towards a full enough understanding to consider complex nonlinear inverse problems and a large set of open nonlinear scattering problems to work on well into their careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded research on nonlinear wave equations from fluid mechanics and optics from August 2013 to December 2017.  The funds were used to support graduate student research, undergraduate research, collaborative visitors and summer support for the PI during that time. \n\nA large part of the budget for this project was developed for collaborative visits.  The PI hosted a variety of collaborators and funded visits to conferences or collaborators, some of which turned into very new and exciting projects.  For instance, the PI invited Pierre Germain and Ben Harrop-Griffiths to visit, which has resulted in new and fundamental results for nonlinear and degenerate models in fluids and weak turbulence.  The techniques developed in the process have provided a blue-print for future work tackling various challenging problems from wetting of fluid interfaces to hydrodynamic limits in quantum mechanics.  In addition, with Dmitry Pelinovsky the PI developed new tools in nolinear analysis on quantum graphs that are proving quite fruitful.  In addition, the PI was able to collaborate repeatedly with Graham Cox on emerging ideas related to use of the Maslov Index in elliptic PDE and spectral theory, and with Dean Baskin with whom the PI has made significant progress on problems related to diffraction.  In With Braxton Osting we looked at spectral optimization on point set configurations that is leading to more and more interesting questions both in spectral theory and in applied optimization.  This is just a small sub-set of the exciting and new research the PI has been able to undertake due to this Applied Math grant.  Collaborations were sustained with applied probabilists on crystal models and physicists on topological lattice models that are also providing new and exciting results as this grant ends.  Each of these projects has led to fruitful collaborations, and provided the PI with countless offshoot projects for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs.  \n\nThe PI was able to support several graduate students, notably Quentin Robinson studying the free surface for fluid flow over obstacles, as well as Yuan Gao studying large ensemble spin systems.  \n\nThe PI has been able to collaborate with three UNC undergraduates on problems related to viscous flow through cylindrical domains, thermodynamic fluctuations in crystal surfaces stemming from broken bond models and numerical analysis of advection-diffusion statistics through pipes with various cross-sections.  These studies allowed for both publications and undergraduate honors theses to be written.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy L Marzuola"
