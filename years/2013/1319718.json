 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to improve the quality of service and lifetime of real-time\r\nembedded systems, particularly those implemented on multi-core platforms. In\r\ncontrast with many other quality metrics, such as performance and power\r\nconsumption, reliability is difficult to accurately estimate because it is\r\ninfluenced by design decisions, environmental conditions, and process variation\r\nduring integrated circuit fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three main technical tasks.  (1) Develop a reliability\r\nmodeling and analysis framework that can efficiently and accurately determine\r\nthe impact of design and runtime management decisions on reliability.  (2)\r\nDevelop a reliability-driven resource management framework, which includes\r\nruntime algorithms for assignment and scheduling of real-time tasks to maximize\r\nsystem lifetime while keeping soft error rates low, and a lightweight technique\r\nto adaptively adjust the activation frequency of the algorithms (i.e.,\r\noverhead).  (3) Develop wear state monitoring techniques and data collection\r\ninfrastructure to enable the runtime refinement and validation of system-level\r\nreliability models that require long-term in-field system deployment.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will support the production of more\r\nreliable and/or less expensive electronic devices, enabling integrated\r\ncircuits, which are susceptible to wear due to lifetime fault processes to be\r\nused in special-purpose computers with strict reliability and performance\r\nrequirements.  In particular, this project aims to ease the use of multicore\r\nprocessors in high-reliability computing applications with deadlines, such as\r\nautomotive, multimedia, and health care applications.  These applications have\r\nhistorically seen slow adoption of multicore processors, despite their price,\r\nperformance, and power consumption benefits.  We believe this is partially due\r\nto gaps in knowledge of how to control and optimize reliability on such\r\nsystems, some of which this project will fill. The involvement of both industry\r\nresearchers and university students at the undergraduate and graduate level\r\nwill result in a broad dissemination of the research results.",
