 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research is to address several main challenges in the realization of practical phononic crystal (PnC)-based devices for wireless signal processing at RF frequencies by 1) relaxing the extreme geometry and fabrication constrains, 2) developing practical PnC devices based on surface acoustic-waves that eliminate the need for thin film and undercutting, and with the broad impact of 3) developing efficient low-impedance electro-statically tunable PnC crystals devices that can potentially eliminate the need for piezoelectric materials. To achieve these goals we will develop a new PnC material platform based on an array of pillar structure on a thin slab material or on an infinite substrate (for surface waves) that also constitute the intellectual merits of this effort. The proposed material platform will be used to demonstrate chip-scale spectral analysis at the L band (i.e., 1 -2 GHz) frequencies.",
