 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the  Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this INSPIRE project is to understand the earliest steps in prebiotic evolution. A longstanding grand-challenge question is how living systems arose from physico-chemical interactions. How did chemistry become biology? When did undirected chemical reactions begin to capitalize on fitness, become self-serving, start competing with others, and undergo Darwinian evolution?  If successful, this project will provide a plausible hypothesis for how random chain sequences could have led to information-transmitting chains, as chemistry becomes biology and potentially to new polymeric materials that are not just self-organizing, but are actually self-evolving.  An integrated approach of theory and experiment will be used to carry out this challenging and risky project. This is a potentially transformative  project because very little is understood about  how sequence-specific polymers, such as proteins and peptoid foldamers, could arise through stochastic processes from random monomer sequences. Questions of how life arose from chemistry are among the most compelling and longstanding in science. Much has been hypothesized about origins of life in the RNA world, membrane world, by metabolism-first or code-first mechanisms, for example, but very little of this discussion focuses on the central question of how Darwinian self-serving bio-like behavior arose from non-Darwinian chemistry. This is a long-standing fundamental question and this project is high-risk because it is in the nature of the origins-of-life field that any particular mechanism proposed for the origin of life from chemistry will be met with skepticism. The complexity of identifying functional domains in polymer sequence space is so vast, both theory and experiment must work very closely together to address this problem.  The tools to approach this problem experimentally have only just recently been developed. Advances in polymer synthesis have reached an exciting point for the first time: one can now synthesize non-natural polymers with exact control of monomer sequence and length, and assemble these chains into protein-like architectures. This capability allows one to test the most fundamental questions about how information content in polymer chains impacts their structure and function.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn important puzzle is how life originated; namely how simple chemicals that undergo physical and chemical reactions could spontaneously start creating copies of themselves in runaway reactions that became self-sustaining.   Among the most interesting and mysterious processes in chemistry is how the spontaneous transition occurred, more than 3 billion years ago, from a soup of prebiotic molecules to living systems. What was the mechanism of the Chemistry-to-Biology (CTB) transition?  We have developed a model to explore what prebiotic polymerization processes might have produced long chains of protein-like molecules.  What polymerization processes could become runaway, producing chains that grow longer and become informational and self-serving?\n\nWe developed a proposed mechanism for this chemistry-to-biology transition.   Using the HP lattice model of polymer sequence spaces leads to the prediction that random sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) monomers can collapse into relatively compact structures, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, acting as primitive versions of today's protein catalysts, elongating other such HP polymers, as ribosomes would now do.  In short, simple known polymerizations of amino acids into peptide chains can randomly create some chains that fold back over on themselves.  This action provides surface sites that can catalyze the polymerization of other such polymers, leading to longer chains that carry information that encodes further runaway reactions that can improve.  This hypothesis can be tested by experiments, and now leads to further questions about how the genetic code arose, involving two types of polymers (functional, like proteins; and informational, like DNA).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ken A Dill"
