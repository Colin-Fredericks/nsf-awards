 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last several decades, Arctic Ocean ice cover has become substantially thinner and more prone to melting, extending the period of open water. Associated with the loss of sea ice has been an increase in light penetration and a dramatic rise in the productivity of phytoplankton. The PIs? primary objectives are to determine the spatial distribution of large under-ice phytoplankton blooms on the Chukchi Shelf and the physical mechanisms that control them. The project proposed herein will utilize new data obtained from both remote instrumentation (e.g. moorings and satellites) and an interdisciplinary ship-based field program to gain a better understanding of the physical/chemical conditions that favor under-ice bloom development as well as the physiological adaptations that allow phytoplankton to flourish beneath sea ice. Outreach and education components of this project include participation in Stanford?s Summer Program for Professional Development for Science Teachers and Stanford?s School of Earth Sciences high school internship program, a compilation of professionally written short stories in the website by WHOI group, and incorporation of results by CRREL.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe long-standing paradigm of the Arctic Ocean is one in which phytoplankton (single-celled plant-like organisms) do not begin to grow until the winter sea ice begins to melt in the late spring, exposing surface waters to the light from the sun.  Phytoplankton then proliferate at the ice edge (called the marginal ice zone or MIZ), supplying a substantial fraction of the food that feeds the rest of the Arctic marine ecosystem.  However, data from the SUBICE (Study of Under-ice Blooms In the Chukchi Ecosystem) project suggest that this paradigm needs to be revised for areas of the Arctic Ocean like the Chukchi Sea, where phytoplankton have been shown to thrive in the relatively low light environment that exists beneath the extensive sea ice cover.\n\nPhytoplankton growth under the ice in the nutrient-rich Chukchi Sea likely begins soon after the snow cover melts, surface melt ponds form, and light transmission through the ice to the water column increases. Whether this early stage of the phytoplankton bloom is initiated by the release of algae from the sea ice is not known.  As phytoplankton continue to grow under the ice, they consume nutrients at the ocean surface.  Eventually, a subsurface layer of phytoplankton develops as nutrients are consumed in the upper water column beneath the ice. When the sea ice finally melts, nutrient-poor surface waters become isolated from nutrient-rich waters below, preventing the development of the classic MIZ bloom that has been observed so frequently in the past.

In addition, Arctic sea ice is retreating 2.4 days earlier each year, accelerating the development of open water phytoplankton blooms.  The implications of this marked shift in the timing and location of peak biological productivity in Arctic waters are unclear but potentially profound. \n\nMany organisms time their migrations and reproduction cycle to coincide with peak phytoplankton abundance in the Arctic so altering the location and timing of the spring bloom could disrupt life cycle strategies that have evolved over millenia.  Furthermore, because these under-ice blooms develop in such cold water, zooplankton grazers cannot grow fast enough to keep pace.  As a result, much of the phytoplankton under the ice go uneaten, ultimately sinking to the bottom in a region already distinguished by tremendous concentrations of bottom-dwelling animals while at the same time decreasing the food available to fish, birds, and mammals that feed in the water column.\n\nThe SUBICE project supported the training and intellectual development of five female Ph.D. students.
