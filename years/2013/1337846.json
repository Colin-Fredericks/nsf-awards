 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Northern Kentucky University (NKU) for the acquisition of field-portable x- ray fluorescence (XRF) technology for undergraduate research and education. XRF technology will advance and broaden socio-ecological teaching and research at NKU. Specifically, XRF will be used to analyze soil lead concentrations in Cincinnati, OH in order to better understand potential tradeoffs with urban gardening activities and learn how information about the landscape can be used to predict areas of elevated lead. Understanding the distribution of a critical urban pollutant will improve our understanding of the important link between urban structure and function, advancing urban ecological theory. In addition, data and predictive models of lead distribution will be shared with community partners and local health agencies to inform the design of safe urban gardens and protect human populations from lead exposure. XRF will advance ongoing projects on plant and microbe community effects on ecosystem processes. This research will deepen our understanding of ecosystem processes by examining linked biogeochemical cycles, specifically the role of heavy metal dynamics in structuring aquatic ecosystems.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental data, including heavy metal and nutrient content of soil and sediment samples will be collected, analyzed, and archived by undergraduate students through existing and newly developed courses in NKU's Environmental Science Program. Data will be used in introductory courses to teach basic concepts of data analysis and in upper level courses to teach concepts of sample design and data collection. XRF technology enhances infrastructure for mentoring students in both education and research. Acquisition of XRF technology strengthens NKU's mission to provide undergraduate students with valuable research experience that expands future career options. Undergraduate students and the surrounding community will benefit from a greater understanding of coupled human-environment interactions that drive the spatial distribution of heavy metals in urban soils.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe acquisition of field-portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology has advanced and broadened undergraduate research and teaching efforts at Northern Kentucky University (NKU).  Undergraduate researchers have used XRF technology in two active and ongoing research projects.  The XRF has been used by PI Schwarz to quantify the amount of lead in soil in several urban communities, including a neighborhood adjacent to a former lead smelter.  A total of 48 properties have been intensively sampled for soil lead, representing over 1,300 soil samples.  The XRF has also been used by PI Hopfensperger to measure redox active species in soil to bridge geophysical electrical conductivity data and plant community metrics.  This project has allowed for collaboration among faculty and students at NKU and The University of Kansas.  A total of 600 samples have been analyzed using the XRF.\n\nBoth projects have engaged undergraduate researchers and a total of 11 undergraduate students have been trained in radiation safety and XRF operation.  Students have presented their research at regional and national conferences - one such presentation highlighted the transdisciplinary nature of the soil lead project which involved both the environmental science and journalism programs at NKU.  NKU undergraduate students have also shared their research with local non-profits, area summer camps, and NKU?s High School STEM Days where approximately 150 local high school students learned about our research.  These experiences not only disseminate our work to broad audiences, they also provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to refine essential skills in science communication.  Results of the research have also been shared in several NKU classes including introductory environmental science, science communication, urban ecology, and ecosystem ecology, as well as guest lectures at undergraduate and graduate institutions addressing concepts of data analysis, sample design, data collection, and spatial heterogeneity.\n\nProducts from the funded proposal include a growing spatially explicit soil lead dataset for the Cincinnati metropolitan area, a wetland soil dataset, one published undergraduate research journal article and one submitted, one peer-reviewed publication, several undergraduate and PI presentations at regional and national conferences, advancement of NKU?s mission to provide undergraduate students with valuable research experience, an expanding network of local non-profit groups interested in legacy pollutants and urban gardening, and an improved understanding of coupled human-environment interactions that drive the spatial distribution of heavy metals in urban soils.
