 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the practice of medicine by the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian genocide. Genocide includes two very different approaches, including the well-known and well-documented policies and practices designed to eliminate unwanted individuals but also lesser-known policies and practices designed to help those individuals believed to be worthy of life. Drawing on insights from political geography and health geography, this project constitutes an in-depth study of the production and distribution of medicine during the genocide as well as the daily medical practices during the genocide. Currently it is not known how the Khmer Rouge intended to develop a health system within Democratic Kampuchea; nor is it well-documented how medicine was actually practiced during the genocide. This project therefore constitutes an effort to enlarge basic theoretical and empirical understanding of the geographies of health within genocide. The project will consist of two components. First, the investigators will document the spatial organization of the Khmer Rouge's planned health system. This will be accomplished through three analyses: a detailed reconstruction and mapping of the spatial organization of the distribution of medicine; a reconstruction and mapping of the production and distribution of pharmaceutical factories and pharmaceuticals; and the documentation and mapping of hospitals that were established during the genocide. Second, they will reconstruct the day-to-day activities of the practice of medicine during the genocide.\r\n \r\nThrough the specific study of the Cambodian genocide, detailed and empirical knowledge of specific practices that led to genocide will be identified. This information will enhance efforts by both scholars of genocide and those involved in legal proceedings related to activities of former Khmer Rouge leaders. This project therefore will facilitate the on-going and long-term process of truth and reconciliation. Documentary evidence and interpretive findings of this project will be disseminated via interactive web-sites linked to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Two U.S. graduate students and one undergraduate student will gain valuable research and education opportunities, and the project will facilitate cross-cultural collaborative efforts among researchers in the United States and Cambodia.",
