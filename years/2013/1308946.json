 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Tunable optical components, ones where their properties can be altered to realize different physical and optical behavior, are of widespread interest for diverse applications ranging from spectroscopy to imaging.  Most of these components sacrifice optical performance for tunability and they are manufactured using structures and processes that are difficult to miniaturize.  In this collaborative project, researchers from the University of Central Florida, Pennsylvania State University, and Lockheed Martin are optimizing infrared chalcogenide materials and nanostructures that exhibit reversible amorphous-to-crystalline phase transitions to have tailored refractive index values and dispersive properties that are continuously tunable.  The availability of such chalcogenide phase change materials will enable the development of new compact, tunable optical components by exploiting the exceptionally large refractive index change associated with the phase transition.  The chalcogenide materials and processes being developed in this project are broadly available through the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Optical materials with compositionally tailored properties that are spectrally tunable and reversible are attractive for producing optical components with unique functionalities.  Chalcogenide phase change materials (PCMs) exhibit rapid and reversible amorphous-to-crystalline phase transitions in response to pulsed thermal, optical, or electrical stimuli.  However, current optical devices based on chalcogenide PCMs have only exploited the large change in optical reflectance associated with the transition between the pure amorphous and the pure crystalline states of the material.  In this collaborative project, researchers from the University of Central Florida, Pennsylvania State University, and Lockheed Martin are conducting experimental studies to identify a chalcogenide composition that enables controlled nucleation and growth of spatially dispersed nanocrystals, which will produce a continuously tunable and reproducible change in the infrared refractive index and dispersion of the composite glass ceramic material.  For each composition, bulk, thin film, and nanopatterned films are being characterized to understand the role of device-relevant boundary conditions on the nucleation and growth process induced by external optical or thermal excitation.  Complementary techniques are being applied to understand the fundamental relationship between the intrinsic material response and the tailored optical performance, including thermal, structural, and optical measurement and analysis.  The structure-property data being collected during this project will provide the critical input needed to design fully tunable optical components using chalcogenide PCMs.  A new mentoring team program, which links university and industry partnered researchers, trains graduate and undergraduate students to have globally-relevant workforce skills.  The chalcogenide phase change materials and processes being developed in this project are available to the broader external academic and industrial community through the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) located at Pennsylvania State University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis summary highlights the research activities and findings, along with the key accomplishments realized in years 1-2 of the funded DMR program.  Contained within the summary is a brief review of the background and motivation, as well as the key areas where the team has modified the program\u00c6s approach based on a desire to show the materials can be manufactured into realistic, photonic structures.\n\nRESULTS and OUTCOMES\n\nThe objectives of the current DMR program aimed to evaluate candidate Ge2Sb2Te5 materials (GST), their process-ability, and resulting properties suitable for further optimization in photonic structures based on phase change materials (PCMs).  Active tuning of a proposed photonic device platform, envisioned by the UCF/Penn State (PSU)/Lockheed Martin (LMCO) team members in partnership with collaborators at MIT, University of Delaware and Clemson University as part of non-NSF (DoE and DTRA) funding, incorporated the (PSU-LMCO) team\u00c6s recently developed Si CMOS and ChG PCM-compatible micro-hotplate circuitry.  This platform, demonstrated in the present program with candidate GST coatings, provides accurate temperature control of the PCM from room temperature up to 800&deg;C using a pulsed bias voltage. The multi-material on-chip structure shown in Figure 1, would be further enhanced by integration of alternative (candidate) phase change materials (PCMs) that could be tuned for their phase change behavior to realize intermediate (partial glass and crystal) form, that allows an intermediate effective refractive index, neff.   GAP-Se chalcogenide glasses were investigated.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the platform, where alternate PCMs, were they to be found to be compatible with fabrication protocols and resulting optical quality, could be employed to realize tailorable, intermediate phase change (IPC) materials (Figure 2) that would enable tunable index structures.  This demonstration illustrated a key component of the YR 1 progress of our team.\n\nThe YR 2 effort has been used to extend alternative PCM material identification for use on the reference structure that will allow a novel in-depth study of reconfigurable PCM\u00c6s for integrated photonics, using states that are intermediate between fully amorphous and fully crystalline (Figure 2). The micro-hotplate employed to \u00e6SET\u00c6 the ChG PCM film in a predefined intermediate amorphous-nanocrystalline phase by heating for a specific time and temperature below Tg. The PCM will be \u00e6RESET\u00c6 to the amorphous phase by increasing its temperature above Tm and then rapidly quenching its temperature below Tg. This locks the PCM in the amorphous state by removing heat quickly. The active area of the proposed planar photonic devices is significantly larger than previous memory devices (10\u00c6s of mm versus 100\u00c6s of nm). \n\nWith the underlying platform for switching demonstrated, the follow on (YR2) effort has aimed to identify other candidate materials to be integrated in the proposed architecture.  \n\n\n\nFigure 3 (top) shows a cross-sectional schematic of one of our electrically driven micro-hotplates used to tune/switch large-area GST PCM films.  A doped-Si resistor was selected over a more conventional serpentine metal heater because it provides excellent thermal stability and significantly lower IR loss. The underlying SiO2 layer, which is a relatively poor thermal conductor, was used to optimize thermal dissipation to the Si substrate for rapid heating and cooling of the GST film. This hotplate design formed the platform on which a candidate ChG would be evaluated.\n\nAs a proof-of-concept carried out during the YR2 program, the optical microscope images in Figure 3 (bottom) show that an initally crystalline GST could be fully and uniformly amorphized by applying a msec-voltage pulse to the Si micro-hotplate. Re-crystallization of the entire GST layer was obtained by applying either a series of 100 msec voltage pulses or a single 1 ms voltage pulse to the micro-hotplate. No degradation was ob..."
