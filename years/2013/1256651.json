This view has permeated scientific literature and practice, precipitating a new field of basic science and capturing public attention. Drawing on in-depth interviews with scientists working in this area, fieldwork in basic science settings, and a content analysis of scientific literature and popular media coverage, this research examines this scientific development. \r\n\r\nAs scientific debates and public conversations about genetics continue, a fuller understanding of the ascendant epigenetic paradigm will assist broader understandings of determinants of health and disease. With growing concern about the prevalence of chronic diseases, this emergent science engages pressing health concerns.\r\n",
