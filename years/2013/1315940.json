 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Miles Becker of University of Nevada, Reno to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang, China.  The project title is \"Warming Temperatures and the Density of a Forest Defoliating Insect in northeastern China.\" The host scientist is Professor YANG Jian.\r\n\r\nBoreal forests comprise 32% of the world's forests and they are an important global carbon sink and provider of timber and forest products.  Milder winters and drought stress in trees from climate change may facilitate insect pest outbreaks that lead to high rates of tree mortality.  The role of temperatures in insect outbreaks is relatively unknown in the northeastern forests of China, and a remote sensing system to monitor and predict outbreaks there is largely undeveloped.  This study is exploring the relationship between temperature, insect abundance, and tree health to validate a regional pest monitoring program for long-term forest management and conservation.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the student and host researcher will co-author a publication on forest disturbances in an international journal and present the results of the project at a forest ecology conference to help managers protect a valuable natural resource.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBoreal forests are an important global ecological and economic resource. Insect pests are one of the primary threats to boreal forest productivity.  The management of pest disturbance requires a better understanding of the effects of warming northern latitudes on pest population cycles. We studied the potential for two insect pests to increase in abundance in response to warming regional temperatures under various forest management strategies.  We sampled larch caterpillar and gypsy moth densities in 67 forest stands in the Da Xing\u00c6an Mountains of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China.  Freezing winter temperatures across sites ranged from -34.9 &deg;C to -28.2 &deg;C and represented the biological impact of the few degrees increase forecasted by the end of the century.  Larch caterpillar (Dendrolimus superans) and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar asiatica) abundance was up to 16 times higher in sampled plots at sites with warmer winter temperatures.  Forest stand structure did not affect larch caterpillar abundance but gypsy moth abundance was highest in warmer sites that also had more trees, younger trees, and fewer larch.  Our results suggest that some of the negative effects of climate change on forest health may be possible to compensate with proper forestry practices.  These data will be useful for projecting forest dynamics in models of global change.  Future studies should investigate the mechanisms for temperature effects on over wintering survival of larch caterpillar larvae and gypsy moth eggs in different habitats. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miles E Becker"
