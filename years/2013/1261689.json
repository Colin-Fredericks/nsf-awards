 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the measurement of a wide range of organic trace gases collected from the HAIS Advanced Whole Air Sampler (AWAS) on the NCAR GV aircraft as part of the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) experiment proposed to take place during January and February 2014 from the island of Guam.  CONTRAST is designed to measure the chemistry and transport of reactive chemical species into the tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the Western Pacific warm pool area.  The trace gases to be measured consist of a range of organic molecules, including a both short-lived and long-lived halocarbon compounds, as well as non-methane hydrocarbons, organic nitrates, and selected sulfur species. These gases will provide information to diagnose halogen transformations and budget of the TTL, to estimate relative age of air in the UT/LS, and to distinguish air mass sources in the region.\r\n\r\nThe sources, chemistry, and transport of trace gases and their degradation products into the lower stratosphere in the tropical Pacific during the boreal winter season can substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere.  This project will improve process-oriented chemistry/climate models and their validation by providing a unique suite of benchmark measurements, especially in the characterization of active halogen chemistry.",

Furthermore, the tropical atmosphere as a whole is the heart of the atmospheric photochemical engine that determines the global fate of many climate relevant trace gases.

A long-standing scientific challenge has been to quantify the chemical composition of the remote tropical atmosphere, from sea surface to the stratosphere, to determine the impact of chemical transformations and transport on reactive chemistry of ozone and other oxidants in that region.  The role of reactive ocean emissions of halocarbons compounds has been especially identified as a critical process that can effect stratospheric ozone levels when tropical convection rapidly moves these reactive compounds from the surface to the upper troposphere.  Obtaining detailed information on the re-distribution of chemically active compounds that are emitted from the sea surface and subsequently transported to the upper troposphere by the region?s massive deep convection has been recognized as a significant scientific challenge for quantifying an important coupling between atmospheric chemistry and climate. The Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) campaign was designed to address this challenge.  Using the GV aircraft, the CONTRAST experiment investigated the vertical distribution of active species over the TWP in Jan-Feb 2014.  Together with the NASA project ATTREX (using the UAS Global Hawk) and the UK project CAST (using BAe146 aircraft), the collaborative experiments obtained unprecedented chemical, dynamical and microphysical information from the sea surface to the stratosphere over TWP.\n\nIn addition to planning and design of the overall CONTRAST mission, this project focused on measurements of organic trace gases from samples obtained on the GV aircraft.  The trace gas measurements included the range of reactive organic halogen gases that were one major focus of this study.  The measurements, combined with computer models, identified the role of local convection as well as long range transport in controlling the vertical distribution of these compounds.  The measurements clearly confirmed the significant contribution of marine halocarbon emissions to the remote atmosphere and to the lower stratosphere. \n\nWhile the role of convection was a major emphasis of the mission, the comprehensive chemical measurements identified other significant modes of transport that had an impact on the chemistry of the remote atmosphere.  For example, pollution from East Asian sources was identified in the remote Pacific region boundary layer.  Analysis indicates that the meteorological conditions associated with cold surge outbreaks are responsible for adding pollutant gases from East Asia to the pristine tropical atmosphere.  Similarly, complex transport pathways of biomass burning emissions from Africa were seen to contribute to pervasive layers of dry, high ozone air in mid-troposphere.   The observations from CONTRAST demonstrated the variety of short and long range atmospheric connections that can influence chemical composition even in the remote atmosphere.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elliot Atlas"
