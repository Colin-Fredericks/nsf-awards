Plasma production in liquid water produces a host of advanced oxidation agents that have the capacity to rapidly decompose organic contaminants. The proposed effort investigates a novel method of producing plasma in bubbles immersed in water by driving them at resonance in the presence of an electric field. This effort studies the ignition physics of resonantly driven bubbles, the time evolution of plasma formation in such bubbles, and the chemistry of the active interfacial layer separating the plasma bubble and the liquid water.  The understanding gained from these studies will be used to design and build a plasma reactor for the purpose of water purification. As part of the educational outreach thrust of this effort, lab tours and demonstrations will be given to visiting grade school students from programs such as the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program and those sponsored by Women in Science and Engineering, using in-house fabricated plasma demonstration experiments.  In addition to sponsoring a student from the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), a program aimed at encouraging underrepresented students to attend graduate school, we will also integrate plasma demonstrations into the existing educational outreach effort led by the National Society of Black Engineers, which involves actually visiting at risk schools in the area for the purpose of inspiring students with hands on experiments, mini-lessons, and mentorship.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEntrained-flow gasifiers are an important technology to achieve cleaner utilization of abundant coal resources.  The design of these gasifiers is dictated by char gasification kinetics, yet few fundamental experimental data exist regarding the rate-limiting process &ndash; the diffusion of gas-phase species within the internal pores of char particles. The goal of this program was to develop optical diagnostics to characterize the temperature and species concentrations in the core of a coal gasifier, and to use the gasifier and diagnostic information to study char gasification kinetics in the diffusion-limited regime.  The outcomes of the optical diagnostics development will be the subject of this project outcomes report.  The char gasification kinetics outcomes will be the subject of a separate project outcomes report from this collaborative grant.\n\nFrom an intellectual merit standpoint, this grant funded the development of a water vapor absorption database and the first application of frequency comb laser sensing in a high-pressure combustion environment (a coal gasifier).  Absorption databases are necessary for interpretation of optical sensing data, thus the database (and associated parameters) developed for this project will be of interest to many high-temperature water-vapor absorption-based measurements.  The database was developed using a new high temperature optical cell facility built at the University of Colorado under this grant.  The absorption of water vapor near 1.3 micron wavelengths was measured under carefully controlled temperatures and pressures using frequency comb laser light from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The fundamental spectral absorption parameters that describe the absorption strength, shape, and wavelength for over 1000 individual water vapor features in this wavelength region were extracted from the measurements.  These parameters can be used to simulate the expected absorption of water vapor at any combination of temperature and pressure, and can therefore be used to interpret absorption measurements from unknown environments.  For this project, the absorption database was used to interpret the frequency comb laser absorption measurements in a coal gasifier in order to determine the temperature and water vapor concentration at pressure up to 20 atmospheres and temperatures up to 1500 degrees C. \n\nUnder a separate NSF grant to this lab, and in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, we built the world?s first mobile dual-frequency-comb spectrometer for making high resolution absorption measurements over a very broad wavelength range outside of the lab.  Under the grant described here, we applied this technology to the coal gasifier at the Colorado School of Mines to measure the unknown temperature and water concentration inside the gasifier at different operating conditions.  The measurements provided critical data on the operating conditions for the char gasification kinetics studies at the Colorado School of Mines (reported in the other project outcomes report). \n\nOur portion of the collaborative grant resulted in four peer-reviewed archival journal articles that have been submitted or are in preparation as of the writing of this report.  This work also contributed to 14 conference presentations and posters.  Additional publications are expected from the kinetics portion of the collaborative grant. \n\nFrom a broader impacts standpoint, this grant funded most of the PhD research for one graduate student, and a two-semester undergraduate research experience for each of two underrepresented minority undergraduate students. Overall, the products of this project contribute to the cleaner usage of coal resources.  Developing knowledge about char gasification kinetics in the diffusion-limited regime improves our ability to design lower emissions and higher efficiency high-pressure gasification reactors.  In addition, the high-pressure, high-temperature sensor technology and spectral database developed here can be extended to other combustion systems for process characterization and control, with the goal of improving efficiency and reducing emissions in these systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory B Rieker"
