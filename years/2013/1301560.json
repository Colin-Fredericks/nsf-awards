 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Metin Akay\r\nProposal ID: 1301560\r\n\r\nNeural engineering is an emerging discipline that combines multiple engineering disciplines, including electronic and photonic technologies, computer science, physics, chemistry, mathematics with cellular, molecular, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience to understand the organizational principles and underlying mechanisms of the biology of neural systems and the behavioral dynamics and complexity of neural systems in nature. To highlight this emerging discipline, the 6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering will be held in San Diego, CA from November 3 through November 6, 2013.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The objective of this conference is to highlight progress in Neural and Cognitive Engineering, an emerging field bridging molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience with engineering, physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. We strongly believe that the neural engineering conference further stimulates neural engineering research and education among neuroscientists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to the keynote, plenary, platform and poster sessions, we will also have a panel to focus on the challenges of making a career in the rapidly growing, interdisciplinary fields of neural engineering, from being hired as part of a team and finding\r\nexciting new research opportunities, to becoming a team leader and what to look for when organizing that team and choosing its members. Options will be discussed for graduate studies and research both internationally and within the U.S., as well as the potential for collaboration among researchers and students internationally.",
