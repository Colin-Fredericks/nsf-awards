Reno and Smith College, a non-Ph.D. granting institution..  The instruments will build on capabilities at the  Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs) and expand capabilities for research and education at Smith College.  New higher resolution capable DTS systems now offer the ability to measure temperature with precisions of 0.1 degree C at centimeter scale spatial resolution and temporal resolution of seconds over several kilometers of a fiber optic strand which can be deployed in lakes, rivers, snow pack, trenched in soil, run down boreholes or strung up trees or along civil structures.  The capability promises continued advances in understanding of watershed hydrology, limnology, physical oceanography, cryosphere dynamics, soil science and terrestrial ecology.  \r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe temperature of water, air and soil across the landscape and through time represents a fundamental measurement of environmental processes.  Historically, temperature observations were made at \"a point in space\", such as an individual weather station, or at \"a point in time\", as with a satellite-based thermal image.  Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) can now provide simultaneous measurement of temperature along fiber-optic cables at spatial resolutions as fine as 0.25 m, and at temporal resolutions of 1 second over a total range of up to 8 kilometers.  The ability to measure water, soil and air temperatures at very high spatial and temporal scales, and across large spatial domains, has allowed insights into near-surface earth processes including current work applied to glacial melt, snow distribution, deep borehole thermal profiles, hyporheic and groundwater emergences in streams, turbulent atmospheric mixing, soil moisture distribution, and lake heat exchange.\n\n \n\nThrough this NSF MRI grant, four DTS instruments were acquired, and they have been incorporated with the Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs).  This instrument-leasing program enables PIs to take advantage of emerging sensing technologies at low cost and with low overhead.  This grant also enabled the establishment of a base of operations for CTEMPs at Smith College, the largest all-women?s college in the United States.  This has facilitated instrument access for east-coast PIs and has engaged undergraduate women in ecological and geoscience research.  Students and faculty at Smith have used the instruments to locate groundwater inputs to a woodland stream and to inform a moss transplantation and salamander movement study at the Ada and Archibald MacLeish Field Station.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Guswa"
