 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monoterpenoid alcohols are synthesized and used in forest insect pest management strategies as pheromone components in traps and lures. In addition, they are important components of consumer products as scents, flavorants, or therapeutic agents. Current production methods rely on organic syntheses or isolation from plant essential oils, with associated costs and limitations. For example, many syntheses require multiple steps, hazardous solvents and/or protocols, and reduced yields. In contrast, enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylations and other modifications occur in single steps, safely in aqueous buffer and often with comparatively high fidelity. Researchers have cloned and characterized pine bark beetle enzymes that modify monoterpenes, including cytochromes P450 and oxidoreductases. In many cases they catalyze specific reactions for different substrates, resulting in single products, sometimes with extreme enantiomeric excess. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to expand the results of prior research on enzymatic monoterpene modification into useful applications and produce monoterpenoid alcohols in a faster, safer and less costly method than current methods. If successfully completed, researchers will be able to show enzymatic conversion of monoterpenes to monoterpenoid alcohols including a specific type suitable for use in bark beetle lures or traps, in amounts approaching 1 gram per run. Additionally, researchers plan to incorporate methods used during this project into undergraduate studies.",

Producing them by organic chemistry can be expensive or hazardous, but producing them using enzymes should be comparatively cheaper and safer. \n\n \n\nThe researchers investigated the potential commercial space for our process and determined that the pest management portion, while small, is sufficient to permit the technology to engage other market segments, including scents and flavorants and pharmaceutical precursors.  They developed a scaled-up process to purify monoterpenoid products and showed it functions in gram-quantity amounts.  They also addressed issues associated with scaling up enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\n\n \n\nThis work led to the establishment of EscaZyme Biochemicals, LLC., (EZB) a start-up company that will extend the efforts initiated by the award.  This company secured seed funding in the form of two business plan competition wins, the direct result of partnering the research/scientific expertise of the P.I. and Entrepreneurial Lead with the business expertise of the Business Mentor.  EZB and its associated efforts have played a role as university administration works to refine its efforts to commercialize results of academic research.  Local media reports on the project and its associated business plan competition success helped publicize local biotechnology efforts.\n\n \n\nThe project engaged six individuals, three of whom were female and two of whom were undergraduate students who worked on biochemical/biotechnological aspects.
