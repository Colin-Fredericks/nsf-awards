 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a workshop entitled \"EarthCube Domain End-User Workshop: Integrating Real-time Data into the EarthCube Framework\" to be held in June 2013 in Boulder, Colorado.  The primary objective of this meeting is to bring together users and providers of real-time data across geosciences disciplines to address community needs for effectively and efficiently handling and applying this type of data. Through oral presentations and in breakout sessions, attendees from universities, federal agencies and industry will develop example cases and explore issues related to gathering and quality control of real-time data that can be used to inform the cyber-infrastructure development within EarthCube.\r\n\r\n \r\nReal-time geoscientific data has the potential to revolutionize the application of scientific data in contexts of importance to a broader audience. Such data streams are key inputs, for example, to operational forecast models and warning systems that inform the general public of impending hazardous weather. This workshop will have a broader impact by helping to build capacity among the community of real-time technologists and researchers whose work affects a wide range of users, including water resource managers, energy planners, farmers, school districts, disaster mitigation and relief planners, urban managers, utilities, cities, etc.",
