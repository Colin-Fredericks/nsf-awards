 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Jared Kaplan at Johns Hopkins University.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few decades, a velvet revolution has changed the way we think about spacetime, gravity, and the fundamental laws of nature.  The most crucial breakthrough was the discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which describes gravity in d + 1 dimensions using a d-dimensional, \"holographic\" theory. The purpose of this project is to understand the robust features of a correspondence between gravitational theories in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetimes and non-gravitational theories with conformal symmetries, and to generalize this so-called \"AdS/CFT\" correspondence to other spacetimes. This will make it possible to understand the generic features of quantum gravity.  Professor Kaplan will also expand on a nascent program characterizing general holographic dualities in terms of bulk effective field theories, and will study various possible generalizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence to situations in which conformal symmetry is broken.\r\n\r\nThis project also has several broader impacts.  The proposed research will be an excellent training ground for postdocs and graduate students, with its wide variety of challenging problems that connect holography to phenomenology and experiment.  Both the theoretical and phenomenological side of high-energy physics inspire others by addressing the simplest questions in profound and beautiful ways, thereby drawing students into important STEM careers while providing them with rigorous quantitative skills.  Professor Kaplan will also be actively engaged in teaching and mentoring at Johns Hopkins University.  Finally, Professor Kaplan will be involved in the Hopkins QuarkNet program, through which he will connect Baltimore high-school teachers and students with cutting-edge ideas in theoretical physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Throughout scientific history, from Dalton to the Large Hadron Collider, a central line of inquiry has been the reductionist program, probing nature at ever smaller distances in order to discover the universe?s elemental constituents.  This program led to the development of quantum mechanics, which now forms the fundamental basis of our understanding of ordinary matter.  However, a long-standing challenge has been to develop a quantum mechanical theory of gravity.  It has recently become clear that to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity, reductionism must be replaced with something new.\n Just as the wavelength of light limits the resolution of a microscope, due to the uncertainty principle, physicists can only look to shorter distances by using higher energy probes.  This process terminates at a fundamental gravitational length (or energy) scale, termed the ?Planck scale?, where the energy density of any probe particles becomes so high that black holes form.  Adding energy beyond this scale does not resolve shorter distances, but only makes the black holes larger.  But how can we understand gravity if not by taking spacetime apart?\n In the same way that the three-dimensional images in a child's pop-up book roughly illustrate the story encoded in its narrative text, we now suspect that the laws of physics in our three-dimensional universe must emerge as the approximate embodiment of a more fundamental theory formulated in only two dimensions.  Or, in a more physical analogy, just as a hologram is a 3D image projected from information encoded on a flat slide, our physical laws may be ?holographic projections? from the lower-dimensional theory.  This means for example that one of the dimensions that we experience is what is termed an emergent approximation, and is not a fundamental aspect of physical law.  There is an irreducible fuzziness to these holographic projections, which captures the breakdown of reductionism at the Planck scale. \n This idea may seem extremely exotic, but it appears that a class of scale-invariant quantum mechanical models called Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) may provide such a holographic description of gravity. This correspondence is generally referred to as the AdS/CFT duality (Anti-deSitter space (AdS) is a spacetime with a natural boundary where the CFT can reside). Indeed, we have seen this at work in concrete models derived from string theory. Unfortunately, the examples that come from string theory are rather contrived, having a very special pattern of forces and little resemblance to our world. \n In my recent work supported by the NSF, by approaching the problem from a radically different angle, I have developed new methods that can describe quantum gravity in a universal manner, and therefore enable a new line of inquiry into the fundamental physical description of the universe.   Our main accomplishments have been to understand how classical spacetimes, and in particular the classical gravitational field of a black hole, can be understood directly using the holographic CFT.  This also enabled us to derive some of the basic features of black hole thermodynamics, including the radiative temperature first discovered by Steven Hawking.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jared Kaplan"
