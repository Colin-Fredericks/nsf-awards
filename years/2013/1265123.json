 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is motivated by the need for robust and intelligent clinical procedure of 'catheterization' which is widely used in medical communities. In this research, the fundamental framework to develop active catheters using an electro-active polymer called Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC). The research work includes the design and fabrication methodologies of robotically controlled IPMC catheters as well as shape controls needed for use in complex passages. The research results will be disseminated in technical conferences and workshops as well as prototype demonstration. Knowing that the catheter based medical therapy/diagnosis is one of important medical technologies and all existing catheters in the market are based upon human operations, this active catheter technology will pave the way to a new biorobotic medical tool that can significantly contribute to improving quality of life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMedical robotics made important changes during the past decade.  The leading edges of the changes include numerous and consistent innovations in robotic devices applied for surgery, diagnostics, drug delivery, rehabilitation, etc. \"Catheterization\" is becoming one of the important medical practices since it engages minimally invasive medical procedures/tooling to administrate diversified and complex medical procedures and surgeries.  The current catheter technology in most clinical practices relies on surgeon-operated and manually driven \"push/pull\" mechanisms that are time-consuming and sometimes introduce some risks in damaging vessel and/or other internal parts of patients.  In this project, we extended our knowledge about an active catheter system using an electroactive polymer system called Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC).  This electroactive polymer system is electrically controllable. The PI focused on actuator platform development.  The collaborator is Dr. Woosoon Yim of University of Nevada, Las Vegas who focused on robotic controls.\n\nIntellectual merit:  We have developed a physic based model encompassing electrostatics, charge transport phenomenon, and mechanics for IPMC and built a number of cylindrical tube type IPMC actuators that are useful for cauterization.\n\nBroader impacts: The robotic catheters can potentially play a pivotal role in the market for medical devices and surgical intervention.  Through this grant, we were able to contribute to build a unique research facility for motion controls for small robotic structures at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  This will extend UNLV\u00c6s unique research capability in microsystems and soft robots.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kwang J Kim"
