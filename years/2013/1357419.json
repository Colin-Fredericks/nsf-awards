 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on inorganic nanocrystal ink-based manufacturing of thin film, light-weight and mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices. There has been tremendous effort focused on developing organic materials for these applications, but organics still suffer from low efficiencies and very poor stability, especially under sunlight. Inorganic inks offer a solution to these problems, but their development has not been nearly as extensive. The key advantage of inorganic nanocrystal inks is that thin films of proven inorganic semiconductors can be deposited with the potential for high device efficiency and stable performance of long time periods. \r\n\r\nThis new materials system could impact the solar cell industry, enabling significant reduction in manufacturing cost compared to standard high temperature vacuum processes that are used now. There are few, if any, technology solutions for portable and integrated solar cells nor are there photovoltaic devices that can be wrapped in a seamless way. This technology has the potential to create a new low-cost solar cell technology that can be employed on various substrates, including plastics and fabrics.  Providing a low-cost photovoltaic device that could be integrated into other products has applications in the aerospace and automotive industries as well as for military purposes.",
