 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This project is for acquisition of a scanning microwave microscope (SMM) system that integrates high resolution imaging and microwave network analysis that operates at frequencies up to 6 GHz. It is capable of mapping impedance, capacitance, dielectric permittivity, permeability and doping density of semiconductors. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed instrument evaporation system will enable researchers at Oakland University to pursue a number of interdisciplinary research projects covering a wide spectrum of technologically-important applications. The SMM is ideal for use on metals, magnetic materials, ferroelectrics, and biological samples to map a range of electromagnetic parameters that are dependent on interaction with microwaves. The instrument will be shared by the Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering faculties. The systems will enhance research infrastructure and will have immediate impact on the following research programs: (i) Multiferroic Nano-composites, (ii) RF-MEMS, (iii) Hydrogen fuel cells, and (iv) Chemical and Biological sensors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed acquisition will significantly enhance interdisciplinary research and educational opportunities for students at Oakland University. The shared facility by Sciences and Engineering faculties will provide with a critical imaging tool and foster collaborative research on new materials for useful technologies. The instrumentation will also facilitate research training for postdoctoral associates and graduate students, research experience for undergraduates and high school students and out-reach activities involving K-12 students. The student population at Oakland University is 75% women and minorities. Efforts will be made to identify, encourage and involve students with disability into related research projects.",
