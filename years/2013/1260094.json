The current version does not fully account for attenuation, which 2-D modeling has shown is a key factor in partitioning of compressional and shear energy at the solid-fluid interface and within porous shallow sediments that characterize most of the seafloor. Predictions from the updated code are to be benchmarked against a commonly used Parabolic Equation algorithm that is well suited for long-distance (far field) calculations, thus enabling study study of water-borne seismic phases all the way from source, through the near field, to far-range receivers. A dataset from the North Pacific will provide constraints for model parameter testing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeismology, the science of vibrations, is one of the few techniques we have to image the interior of the solid earth and it has provided the observational framework for many advances in geology from plate tectonics to petroleum exploration.  In marine seismology it is convenient to place sources and receivers in the ocean where underwater sound couples\n\nto the earth's vibrations.  In order to understand how sound and vibrations propagate in the earth we use computer models based on the theory of elastodynamics.  Depending on the application various assumptions are applied to simplify the problem. \n\nMost of the earthquakes in the world occur below the seafloor and when they occur they excite acoustic waves in the ocean called T-phases.  With a relatively inexpensive network of hydrophones moored in the ocean it is possible to monitor the earthquake activity throughout an ocean basin.  The resulting T-phase catalog consists of many events that are too small to be observed on land but still have the potential to be  useful for studying geological processes.   Many aspects of T-phase excitation and propagation are poorly understood.\n\nIn this project we sought to apply a forward modeling code, called SPECFEM3D, to the T-phase problem.  SPECFEM3D was originally developed to study seismic wave propagation in the whole, spherical earth with rough interfaces, laterally varying structures, scattering, intrinsic attenuation, all wave types (compressional and shear body waves and interface waves), fluid and solid media, and all in three dimensions.  The code was formulated to run on a cluster of computers with hundreds of processors.   We took a version of the code from the Computational Infrastructure in Geodynamics program that had been reconfigured for a Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system and tried to apply it to a test model that simulated an actual experiment that we had carried out in the North Pacific.  We made a lot of progress in 1) validating the results of the code with other codes for simplified models, 2) allowing for separate attenuation values for compressional and shear waves, and 3) improving the absorbing boundaries.   We fell short however in actually running our test model on the code due to a long list of programming hurdles.  The code has great potential. It is open source, well-maintained and supported, but it is just not applicable to our T-phase problem yet.\n\nFor outreach and broader impacts we updated our web site, Plymouth Wave Lab, which demonstrates wave concepts for middle and high school students and added examples showing the effects of intrinsic attenuation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ralph A Stephen"
