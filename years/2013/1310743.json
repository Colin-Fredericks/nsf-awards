 "awd_abstract_narration": "Malaria parasites produce male and female cells within the blood of their vertebrate host (e.g. humans, birds, or lizards) that infect the blood-feeding insects that transmit them. The proportion of male vs. female cells influences the number of new parasites produced following mating, and Sex Ratio Theory predicts the best ratio that will maximize parasite transmission success. The graduate student developed new predictions for the optimal sex ratio based on the parasite?s transmission, which is that proportionally fewer parasites surviving within-insect development should favor sex ratios nearer 1:1. Insects will be infected with multiple strains of a lizard malaria parasite. Parasite numbers and the abundance of different strains will be monitored throughout development using newly-developed techniques in molecular genetics.\r\n\r\nThis study is important for understanding not only the sex ratio of malaria parasites, but also malaria transmission in general. This lizard parasite is of particular interest because it has the fastest known within-insect development. Monitoring proportions of strains may help understand patterns of genetic diversity, which relate to drug resistance and virulence. This project will provide opportunities for undergraduates and younger students to gain research experience, including directly funding one undergraduate field assistant. Data, animations, and research descriptions will be available online (www.uvm.edu/~aneal/homepage.html).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlease note: A Change in Objectives or Scope was approved for this project, so the title no longer reflects the project undertaken.\n\nUnderstanding the distribution and behavior of insects that transmit disease may help explain and predict the distribution and transmission patterns of the disease itself.  We investigated one example: a lizard malaria parasite that is transmitted by a weak-flying sand fly.  Despite having a very common and abundant lizard host, the distribution of this parasite in its lizard host is very patchy, with areas of high infection prevalence only meters from areas of low prevalence.  The parasite also shows genetic differences at sites as little as 0.5km apart.  The highly mobile, widespread lizards are unlikely to contribute to this strange pattern in the parasite, but it is possible that the sand flies do.  We therefore endeavored to determine whether there were genetic differences between sand flies from areas that were close to one another, which would suggest that they do not regularly move between these sites.  We developed new genetic markers for these sand flies and found evidence that the flies at different sites do appear to be genetically differentiated from one another, potentially contributing to the patchy distribution of the parasite they transmit.\n\n \n\nThis research program makes a number of significant contributions to the study of parasite and disease ecology.  First, it once again highlights the importance of the insects that transmit parasites in understanding parasite distributions.  Second, it contributes to our understanding of sand fly population genetics in general.  This contribution is of practical importance because these insects are nuisances in some areas and also transmit human diseases like leishmaniasis.  Third, it presents a number of new genetic markers designed specifically for sand flies that may be useful for future studies of this and other species.\n\n \n\nThis research program also provided invaluable training for a graduate student and four undergraduates.  Students developed many skills involved in working with DNA (including DNA extraction, sequencing, primer design and PCR), analyzing genetic data (including electropherogram interpretation and statistical analysis), and collecting and identifying insects in the field.  The students also had the opportunity to visit a medical entomology research facility, where they discussed this and other research with experts in the field.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allison T Neal"
