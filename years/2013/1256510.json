 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips.  The new process involves two steps.  First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex).  Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once.  In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUltra-sharp tungsten probes are used in many applications to explore the electrical properties of areas less than 5,000 square nanometers.  However, these probes display an insulating character, which is a consequence of their exposure to air during or after sharpening.  The air exposure affords a very thin layer of insulating tungsten oxide.  This tungsten oxide layer can be broken through mechanically, but this tactic is problematic: it works only intermittently and sometimes damages the probe.\n\nThis project explored various ways to coat tungsten probes with oxidatively resistant films.  The goal was to by-pass procedures needed to remove oxide coatings and make the tungsten probes highly conductive despite air exposure.\n\nSeveral promising strategies to prevent or reverse the formation of the insulating tungsten oxide layer were explored.  These included attempts to remove the oxide over layer using argon ions to sputter it away without removing the underlying tungsten.  These probes were then immediately protected from oxidation by sputter deposition of a noble metal.  Another approach entailed use of a hydrogen plasma to remove the tungsten oxide by chemical reduction.  We chose this approach since reduction of tungsten oxide by molecular hydrogen (H2) is known to be difficult:  at temperatures below about 550 &deg;C, molecular hydrogen converts tungsten oxide into a tungsten bronze phase that is harder to reduce than tungsten oxide itself.  Likewise, these probes were then immediately protected from oxidation by sputter deposition of a noble metal.\n\nThese efforts to generate air-exposed conductive tungsten probes were unsuccessful.  The difficulty was ascribed to coating contaminants, which rendered the coatings or their under layers insulating.  Efforts to minimize these contaminants were likewise unsuccessful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott P Lockledge"
