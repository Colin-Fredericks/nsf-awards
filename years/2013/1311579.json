 "awd_abstract_narration": "The degree to which an organism can plastically modify its morphology or physiology by changing gene expression helps set the range of environments to which it can acclimate. As an alternative to acclimation, organisms may deal with environmental differences by adaptive alteration of allele frequencies across generations. However, the same genomic changes that facilitate acclimation over ecological scales may provide substrate for change over evolutionary time. This project will study genes involved with acclimation and adaptation to depth in Caribbean corals. In candelabrum corals (genus Eunicea), variation in depth generates adaptive phenotypic differences that may lead to the formation of new species at different depths. This study will use transplanted fragments from coral colonies collected at and acclimated to different depths to measure plasticity in gene expression and test if two depth-segregated species have diverged in their acclimation response to depth. The proposed research represents an innovative attempt to evaluate the role of plasticity in providing initial variation during adaptive divergence of closely related species with different ecologies.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how organisms cope with environmental variation provides basic knowledge on how to implement restoration plans in changing ocean. This is of paramount importance for Caribbean reefs, where coral cover has decreased by > 80% since the eighties, coral bleaching is becoming more frequent, and the billion-dollar income it generates in Florida alone through recreation is in peril. PIs in this proposal will also continue engaging high school and undergraduate women with science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDepth provides a major ecological transition in the sea that can generate differences in organismal form and physiology and adaptive divergence between populations.  The dissertation research of Carlos Prada aimed to understand how depth could lead to genetic and phenotypic divergence in two closely related species of sea fans. Prada initially showed that the single named species Eunicea flexuosa (Fig. 1) is actually composed of two genetically isolated, depth-segregated species. Experiments suggest that survivorship substantially decreases when these two are reciprocally transplanted between depths. The work supported by this grant used transplanted fragments of sea fan colonies to measure how gene expression varies when the same clone is placed at different depths and test whether the two species have diverged in their acclimation response to depth.\n\nThe approach taken employed four transplant treatments: samples of the Shallow species from their native shallow habitat and those that had been transplants to the deep, and samples of the Deep species from their native habitat as well as from Deep transplants to a shallow setting.  Samples of replicate colonies for each treatment were subjected to RAD-Seq, a technique that generates millions of DNA sequences per sample for genes that are being actively copied and turned into proteins.  These data can be used to estimate both how much sequences of genes have changed and how many copies of genes are being made.\n\nWhen overall genetic differences are combined, the Shallow and Deep species clearly differentiated, even for samples taken from intermediate depths (Fig. 2).  Despite these consistent overall differences, both genes show little divergence between the two depth forms (Fig. 3).  A small fraction (around 1%) of genes, however, are strongly differentiated between the two.  These differentiated genes are candidate regions for explaining the genetic basis of evolutionary changes between the two depth-segregated species.  While gene sequence divergence between the two forms is subtle, differences in gene expression are marked (Fig. 4), even when colonies have been transplanted out of their home habitat.  Still, each form did show changes in their gene expression profiles when moved to a foreign habitat.  These changes varied between the two species: when the Deep species was moved to shallow water, about 50 genes changed, while when the Shallow species was moved to a deep setting, over 1500 genes changed their expression levels.  These differences in expression level changes parallel observed levels of stress for the transplant: while neither form does as well as natives when moved out of its depth, the Deep form has higher survival rates in shallow water than the Shallow form has down deep.  Ongoing analysis of the data will determine whether the genes which change in expression between the two species are the same as those that change most within-species following transplantation to a different depth.\n\nAlong with these genomic studies of gene expression, the grant also provided partial support to work in E. flexuosa that 1) showed that algal symbionts living within the sea fans co-evolved with their depth-segregated hosts and 2) genetic differentiation between depths is not as strong for small juveniles as for previously characterized large adult colonies.  Work on some co-occurring corals (genus Porites) that had previously been considered different species showed these habitat specialists were instead morphological variants of a single species.  Together, this work has resulted in three publications to date, with another one in review and three further anticipated for submission in the coming year.\n\nThis grant helped to train Ph.D. student Carlos Prada in new methods of genomic and evolutionary analysis. Prada in turn supervised research by three undergraduate students, including two who are or will be authors on scientific publications.  Beyond their intellectual impact, o..."
