 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program now spans multiple directorates.  Of particular relevance to this proposal, the Social, Behavioral and Economics (SBE) Directorate is now an important part of SaTC.  Increasingly, it is recognized that computer security involves humans and applications, the forte of SBE's research, in additional to the traditional technical problems the Computer Science community, the mainstay of the CISE Directorate, have worked on.   Applications of interest are those related to \"critical infrastructures\", such as electricity delivery, financial systems, and healthcare, all of which offer unique security and privacy concerns in addition to requiring traditional security solutions. \r\n\r\nDespite its importance to an eclectic view of computer security, too few proposals integrating social science research and security have been submitted to SaTC.  The purpose of the \"Cyber Caf\u00e9\" is to help promote more interest in proposals that are at the intersection of social science and more traditional computer security research.  It is expected that the Cyber Caf\u00e9 will foster collaborations between the social science and traditional security communities by informing each of the communities to research interests of the other community and in general helping the two communities build teams that will submit proposals to future SaTC solicitations. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Cyber Caf\u00e9 will be entirely virtual.  Participants will have access to this meeting by phone and the Web but in a manner that promotes collaboration, interaction, and team building.",
