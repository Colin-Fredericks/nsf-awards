 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first step in speech comprehension is to break up the speech signal and identify the individual words. To do so, one must locate where one word ends and the next begins. Unlike in written text, where there is a visual gap between pairs of words, no such reliable cue for word boundaries exists in spoken speech. Research has shown that native English listeners can utilize a set of cues to segment continuous speech, including the structure and meaning of sentences, knowledge of what constitutes a real word in English, sensitivity to whether a sound is allowed in a certain position in the word, and the emphasis given to a part of the word. However, it is not clear whether these segmentation cues are used by nonnative listeners in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nThe use of cues may be influenced by nonnative listeners' English proficiency. Beginning or intermediate second language (L2) learners may have less established knowledge about what constitute a real word in English. Also, L2 learners' use of cues may be influenced by the characteristics of sounds in their native languages. Four groups of participants, including a monolingual English group and three nonnative groups (Mandarin, Korean, and Spanish), will participate in four experiments. Each experiment will examine how L2 learners differ from native listeners in the use of cues and how the three L2 groups differ from each other as a result of their native language experiences.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding speech is a critical component in language acquisition and identifying cues that can facilitate this process will benefit both learners and teachers. There are nearly 40 million L2 learners in the U.S.; improved English proficiency will help them become more competitive and productive in the work place. This study also contributes to the training of a promising young researcher.",

Listeners can solve the segmentation problem by utilizing a variety of cues such as the context and structure of sentences, listeners&rsquo; own knowledge of what constitutes a real word in English, which sound is legal or not legal at the beginning&nbsp;or ending of a word, and greater phonetic emphasis at the edges of word. Previous research with native English listeners have shown that, when all cues are available, they tend to rely more on sentence and vocabulary cues than cues that involve individual sounds or acoustic cues.

The reason for choosing these three L1 languages was that they vary in terms of which sounds are allowed in word-initial or word-final positions. The phoneme /n/ is allowed in both word-initial and word-final positions in all four languages. In Mandarin, Korean, and English, [ng] (as in <em>sing and finger</em>)&nbsp;is only allowed word-finally while this phoneme does not exist in Spanish (although /n/ is sometimes realized as [ng] in certain phonological environments). While /s/ is allowed word-initially in all four languages, this consonant cannot be in the word-final position in both Mandarin and Korean. Four experiments were conducted. In each experiment, participants were asked to identify or make lexical judgment about the target word, which is embedded in a phrase or sentence, thus word boundaries must be identified before participants could make a response. Experiment 1 showed that all three L2 groups did not use vocabulary knowledge to the same extent as native English listeners. Experiment 2 showed that although [ng] does not exist in Spanish&rsquo;s phoneme inventory, Spanish L2 learners of English did not experience any difficulty using this cue in segmentation. In other words, they are faster to identify a word boundary following [ng] than following /n/. On the other than, all four language groups were slower to identify a word boundary following /s/ than following /n/ since /s/ is more likely to be a word-initial consonant than /n/. Therefore, listeners might have mistakenly grouped /s/ with the following word.
