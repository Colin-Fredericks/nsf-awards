 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will elucidate two novel biological mechanisms for living systems to contend with particulate environments. Flying insects must avoid or negotiate droplets in rain and mist. Larger organisms use eyelashes to diver particle-laden flows from delicate organs such as the eyes. In parallel with the research efforts, the PI will use these familiar and highly visual topics to naturally guide an educational program to broaden the scope of biophysics past the traditional cellular level and increase its visibility to all audiences. The PI will study experimentally the interactions of mesoscale objects (mosquitoes and eyelashes) with particulates in a surrounding fluid medium. The following hypotheses based on preliminary work will be tested. (1) Insects survive collisions with raindrops by tumbling their bodies to reduce impact impact force. The universality and limits of this ability will be examined across a range of insect sizes. (2) Using high-speed video, the PI observes that mosquitoes are unable to stabilize their flight in fog. The failure of an otherwise robust system is surprising. The PI hypothesizes that gyroscopic signals from their halteres are overcome by signals created by inertial impact of fog drops and subsequent water accumulation. This hypothesis suggests a novel mechanism for the action of pesticides, and is of interest to his collaborators at the Navy Entomological Center. (3) Investigate how mosquitoes shed dew collected on their bodies using high frequency vibrational energy harvested from their wing flaps. The PI will conduct a parallel study on particle deposition on vertebrate surfaces, hypothesizing that mammalian and avian eyelashes divert incoming flows to reduce particle deposition onto the ocular surface. The PI will recruit undergraduates, high-school students and teachers from underrepresented groups. He will establish a photography internship at GT to increase the use of aesthetic and scientific photography in labs to facilitate scientific communication to the public. He will also teach \"Living with particles,\" a new lab course on biophysics of locomotion. With a 10th-grade teacher, he will develop \"Snakes on a Plane,\" one of a series of educational modules to teach Georgia Physical Standards. The PI will test and disseminate these modules by hosting students and teachers during \"Wet Week,\" a weeklong workshop at our institution.",

This work is covered in a series of journal articles, nature documentaries, and a book for the general public. Overall, we show that insects are resistant to collisions with large objects like raindrops, but the smallest particles can provide the most damage. \n\nWe begin with a study of how mosquitoes are affected by such particles of various size.  A raindrop is 50 times the weight of a mosquito, but does not kill a mosquito upon impact.  The mosquito is so lightweight that raindrops do not splash upon impact, but are simply pushed by the raindrop.  We show that larger flying insects such as bumblebees can receive larger impact forces because their bodies weigh more and resist the motion of the drop.  Thus bumblebees or larger micro flying air vehicles may be damaged by raindrops.  Smaller particles can be more debilitating to mosquitoes than raindrops. We show that dew can deposit on the halters of mosquitoes, small gyroscopic organs, that are used to orient the insect in flight.  As a result, mosquitoes can still flap their wings, but will become disoriented and tumble and fall through the air.\n\nWe next studied how bees can clean pollen off their bodies.  A bee can pick up 30 percent of its body weight in pollen on its way back to the hive, but it can also completely clean its body of these small particles in under a minute.  We show that elastic hairs on the bee prevents pollen from sticking to the body, and catapults the pollen off when the bee grooms itself.  This study inspired other workers to make a hairy medical patch that can have a great concentration of granular medical particles than a flat patch.\n\nMammals are much larger than insects but they too can prevent the impact of particles by generating air flows to divert particles away.  When animals walk forward, eyelashes of mammals divert incoming airflow from impacting the eye.  The eyelashes can reduce the rate of drying of eyes by 40 percent.  The tails of cows, horses, and other large mammals also play a role in shooing away insects.  We show that the tail swings at the same speed that a mosquito flies, generating an aerodynamic shield that also diverts them off course, and making them less likely to bite.\n\nIn the man-made world, such particles can reduce the efficiency of certain devices.  For example, solar panels lose 15 percent of their energy intake per month due to the deposition of dust. The only way to clean them is to wipe them with an automated wiper, which may not work in dry settings like.  By studying the ways that animals reduce damage from incoming particles , we can invent new ways for devices to work in these conditions.\n\nHu was also attacked for \"wasteful science\" by senator Jeff Flake in 2016.  Hu defended his work in a TEDx talk and an article for Scientific American, and wrote a book that featured much of the research funded here. The book won the 2019 American Institute of Physics Science Communication Award and was a finalist for the 2020 AAAS Subaru Young Adult Science Book Award.  Subaru will donate 90,000 copies of books to schools around the US.  Hu\u2019s research for this award was also featured in the New York Times, The Economist, Saturday Night Live, and Highlights for Children.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Hu"
