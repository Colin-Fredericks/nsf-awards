 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Lewis & Clark College (L&C) in Portland, Oregon to acquire a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope, which will enable at least six different laboratories on campus (in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Departments) as well as two collaborating labs at other institutions (in Molecular Biosciences and Neurology Departments) to expand and innovate their existing research programs. Confocal microscopy is an advanced fluorescence imaging technique that has a number of advantages over traditional fluorescence microscopy and is a particularly powerful tool for live imaging experiments. The enabled projects focus on live imaging, both in whole organisms (zebrafish, nematode, yeast) and in cultured neurons (mouse). Some of these include: 1) a powerful multicolor approach (Brainbow) to test how newborn cells in the immature brain transform into organized neuronal circuits; 2) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study interactions among ribosomal components in yeast; 3) photoconvertible proteins to study the regulated release of factors in hippocampal neurons during neuronal activity; and 4) in vivo imaging techniques in living zebrafish to study the behavior of proteins that underlie Parkinson's Disease in humans. The principal investigators have externally funded, active research programs that engage undergraduate students as partners in data generation and publications in peer-reviewed journals. Acquisition of a confocal microscope will help these laboratories to generate high-quality publications in areas that utilize and develop cutting-edge live imaging approaches. \r\n\r\nThe confocal acquisition will also have a number of important broader impacts. First, future generations of scientists will have the opportunity to master modern imaging approaches during their undergraduate training. Many L&C students go on to Ph.D. programs and careers in science after winning competitive research fellowships. In part this can be attributed to L&C's strong focus on involving undergraduates in meaningful research; in the past five years, more than 90 undergraduate students have contributed as co-authors on publications. These dedicated and capable students will become trained in advanced microscopy by using the confocal system in their coursework and/or research laboratory. Second, L&C is a leader in the training of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science. The natural sciences at L&C boast large numbers of women majors. In addition, L&C runs a successful, HHMI-funded summer research program that brings high school students from under-represented groups to campus for an intensive, 8-week laboratory experience. The confocal microscope will thus impact large numbers of young women who have chosen to pursue a career in science, as well as high school students who are just beginning to consider the direction of their future training. The opportunity to conduct live imaging experiments is often inspiring for students at this critical stage in their career path. Finally, the L&C Watzek Library Digital Initiatives staff will help design and construct an online public gallery that will showcase selected images and videos captured using the confocal microscope. The funded equipment thus has the potential to impact the broader community and to increase scientific literary among the public",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF award titled \"Acquisition of a laser scanning confocal microscope system to advance research in biology, chemistry, and physics at L&amp;C\" allowed Lewis &amp; Clark College to purchase its first confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) in 2013.   This microscope has revolutionized the research and training that can be done by and alongside undergraduate students at Lewis &amp; Clark College.  A team of faculty in the departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics lead this work.  Over 50 students and faculty have been fully trained to date on the microscope system (including three Goldwater recipients), and countless others have observed demonstrations on the microscope or been partially trained.  The microscope is used in advanced Biology, Biochemistry, and Physics courses, and also in faculty-sponsored student research.  In the three-year award period (2013 to 2016), almost 4,000 hours have been logged on the microscope, averaging approximately 25 hours of student imaging per week.  The images generated have been featured in published, peer-reviewed scientific articles, on the covers of journals, at scientific meetings, in research talks for both specialized and general audiences, on websites, and in non-scientific publications.  Some of this work is featured on the Lewis &amp; Clark College Digital Initiatives Collaborative Research website. \n\nThe research that has been enabled by this award includes the following topics:  visualizing live cell division in neuronal stem cells of the brain that are responsible for generating nerve cells in embryonic development; measuring protein aggregation in nerve cells of living zebrafish to study the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson?s Disease; studying the cell biology of a gene called lyst, which is altered in Chediak&shy;Higashi Syndrome in humans; measuring the intracellular clustering of a protein named Syntaxin 3 at synapses in hippocampal neurons; and testing possible neural mechanisms for the effect of nicotine on neuron development in the Drosophila brain.  In collaboration with faculty, undergraduate students are the primary scientists who work on these projects,  collecting and analyzing their imaging data independently.  After completing their undergraduate research, the overwhelming majority of these students go on to graduate school, medical school, or other careers in science; thus this award is helping to train the next generation of scientific problem solvers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tamily Weissman"
