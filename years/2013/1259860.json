 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholarships Creating Opportunities for Applying Mathematics (S-COAM) project at Indiana University of Pennsylvania establishes supportive connections between Master's students and undergraduates through various cohort activities, while increasing numbers of students pursuing mathematics degrees, improving retention, and enhancing recruitment from regional community colleges. Scholarships support ten students seeking the Master's of Science degree in Applied Mathematics, and 18 undergraduates seeking a major in a mathematical area or minor in mathematics with another science-related major; at least 49 students are supported over three years. Effectiveness is assessed by student surveys and an outside evaluator.\r\n \r\nThe highlights of S-COAM  include the formation of a supportive cohort of students focused on applied mathematics, mentoring and leadership opportunities for participating Master's students and undergraduates, expectations of students doing research or internships and attendance of STEM-related presentations by visiting scholars. \r\n\r\nS-COAM expands career options of women, minorities, first-generation, economically disadvantaged, rural, and others by providing support to pursue advanced mathematics coursework and providing workforce-ready graduates trained on industry standard software. S-COAM builds university and student connections in the region through internship and job placement with local businesses as well recruitment visits to and research presentations at local educational institutions.",

Through this project students participated in monthly cohort meetings, technology workshops, and networking events with graduate students, faculty, industry mentors, and external speakers. These high-impact practices improve retention, persistence and academic performance, enhancing student preparation to begin challenging STEM careers and pursue advanced study. Monthly meetings engaged students in professional development activities, showcased applications of math and science, and provided opportunities to improve critical thinking, communication and presentation skills, and to share internship experiences and research work. Additionally, individual academic performance was carefully monitored and faculty mentoring encouraged students to take more advanced mathematics coursework.</p>\n<p>Regional recruiting efforts used faculty and S-COAM scholar representatives to encourage more students to pursue graduate studies via these scholarships. Undergraduate scholarships increased retention and persistence of IUP students and encouraged science students to minor in mathematics. Specific program outcomes include:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>* Direct support for undergraduates including 17 mathematics majors and 37 science majors with a mathematics minor. All undergraduates completed or are continuing in their degree programs.
