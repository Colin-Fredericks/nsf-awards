 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Walter Varhue of the University of Virginia to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Nangang District, Taipei City, Taiwan. The project title is \"The Development of a Microfluidic Device for the Detection of Low Concentrations of Ribonucleic Acid Biomarkers.\"  The host scientist is Professor Chiafu Chao.\r\n\r\nThis projected develops a microfluidic device for the sub pM amperometric detection of Ribonucleic acid biomarkers utilizing a redox cycle and a nano-slit platform. The use of a nano-slit platform for this device lowers the sample to answer assay time through the limitation of the potential diffusion lengths and the electro-kinetic pre-concentration of the target biomarker. The signal current produced by this device is also amplified through the use of a redox cycle. The integration of these techniques in a single device achieves a great improvement in the ability to detect biomarkers at a fM dilution. Furthermore, through device characterization, the diffusion of particles confined by nano-scale geometry and its effect on electro-chemical detection will be able to be studied. This improved detection ability will eventually allow for faster diagnosis of possible infections and easier detection of infectious materials in an environment. Its inclusion on a Lab-on-a-chip style microfluidic device will also allow for miniaturization of this process allowing for greater portability. The development of detection methods capable of discerning the viability, infectivity, and speciation of infectious micro-organisms is a healthcare priority for early diagnosis of infection and routine monitoring for infectious material.  The device proposed in this research project will facilitate an improvement of such methods through the sub pM amperometric detection of Ribonucleic acid biomarkers. The use of such a proposed device will lead not only to greater ability to detect and diagnosis pathogens but also may lead to the miniaturization of such technologies. Portability will enable easier and faster detection of potential health hazards.\r\n\r\nBroder impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this training will expand the Fellow's abilities as a teacher in the University of Virginias IC fabrication laboratory.",
