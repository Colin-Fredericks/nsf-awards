The study area is ideal to implement the proposed bottom-up approach study barriers to the diffusion and adoption of 'indigenous\" technologies since: it is especially prone to the effects and escalating risk of natural hazards (e.g., high winds) and global climate change; local collaborating materials scientists have studied and prototyped two candidate building materials to be evaluated, one for new construction (wood-plastic composites) and one for retrofit/repair (low-cost cement-polymer mortar); and, local stakeholders have yet to embrace innovations. The project will investigate barriers to the diffusion and adoption of building technologies through the lens of recent conceptual and analytical social science perspectives, including social network analysis and science, and technology and society (STS) studies. Historically, the strongest technological, cultural and aspirational connections have run from the Global South to the Global North. Recently, transportation and communication innovations have made South-South interaction more viable and vibrant. Social science research, however, has not assessed the impact of more intense, multi-scalar South-South networks on the diffusion and adoption of new building technologies. By testing the proposed research hypothesis, new knowledge will be created to understand how to integrate social considerations influencing technology diffusion and adoption into the process of conceiving, researching and developing new building technologies, and shepherding them from the laboratory to the field. The project will provide opportunities for a diverse team of researchers (1 minority, 2 women, and 2 early-career) and students to participate in substantive international research. With respect to societal benefits, research will contribute to the mitigation of the impacts of disasters in the study area, with potential application to coastal regions of the US and elsewhere. The project will also promote bottom-up collaboration as an alternative means of improving quality of life and represents the first building block for a transnational network for the dissemination of knowledge in coastal regions of the Global South. This award is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program.",

The sociological research consisted of two fact-finding visits and meetings with local researchers and governmental and NGO officials and site visits to better understand the on-the-ground conditions related to informal and affordable housing in the coastal towns along the Yucatan coast on the Gulf of Mexico and their susceptibility to climate induced vulnerabilities. These visits were followed up with a detailed door-to-door survey of 628 households in Celest&uacute;n, Chelem, Chuburn&aacute;, Chicxulub, Telchac, R&iacute;o Lagarto, and San Felipe. The surveys were conducted by students from the City College of New York in collaboration with students from Centro de Investigaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica de Yucat&aacute;n (CICY) (Yucatan Center for Scientific Research). &nbsp;The survey revealed that (1) 85% of respondents have identified changes in natural disasters/climate, (2) 79% of respondents perceived some threat or risk living along the coast (44% reported flooding or water ingress), (3) 72% of households have been affected by natural disasters, (4) Nearly 75% of those affected have taken measures to protect their property, (5) About 32% of households have not taken measures to protect their property from natural disasters/climate change (mostly due to cost), (6) 73% of households are willing to use alternative materials to make their dwellings more resilient, however, the majority of respondents were not familiar with non-traditional materials. &nbsp;The materials engineering research studied ways to use indigenous and local materials to strengthen and protect informal concrete masonry dwellings primarily from damage due to flooding, water ingress due to wind-driven rain, and impacts from flying debris (concerns which were determined from the survey). &nbsp;A novel low-cost strengthening method using readily available fishing-nets (these are primarily fishing communities) together with a cementitious based mortar to apply overlays to the masonry structures was developed. &nbsp;Field applications have not been attempted to-date. &nbsp;The research in Kenya and Tanzania had a primarily economic component and dealt with how to enable scale up of sustainable and resilient materials technologies in the housing sector. The research consisted of two fact-finding visits to Nairobi, Kenya and one hands-on learning experience in Arusha, Tanzania for 17 students from Penn State University. &nbsp;The outcomes from these events was to establish extensive relationships with key academic, government and NGO individuals who have committed to further research in this domain. &nbsp;The research was conducted in collaboration with faculty from the University of Nairobi in Nairobi, Kenya and the Nelson Mandela Institute for Science and Technology in Arusha, Tanzania.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/21/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lawrence&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bank</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321464/1321464_10251706_1498071217754_Picture7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321464/1321464_10251706_1498071217754_Picture7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kibera construction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1321464/1321464_10251706_1498071217754_Picture7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kibera construction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adobe dwelling construction in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">L.C.
