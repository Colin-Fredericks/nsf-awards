 "awd_abstract_narration": "Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) is a key feature of server virtualization that underlies numerous operations in cloud computing platforms such as routine maintenance, load balancing, scaling to handle peak demands, and saving energy. Even though work in both industry and academia has made impressive advances in live migration technology, several important challenges remain to be addressed. This research investigates new VM migration mechanisms having better performance, robustness, and security. In particular, this work explores (1) simultaneous live migration of multiple VMs using distributed de-duplication and scatter-gather transfer of memory contents, (2) fault-tolerant VM migration to recover VMs after a failure during live migration, and (3) secure live VM migration techniques that reduce the performance impact of encryption and increase robustness against attacks.\r\n\r\nThis research benefits modern data centers by advancing the state-of-the-art in live VM migration technology. Broader impacts include technology transfer, outreach to local high schools, and involving undergraduates, women and minority students in research. Integration of research with education includes development of course modules, course projects, and an advanced topics graduate course.",

Live migration of VMs is a key feature of server virtualization that underlies numerous operations in cloud computing platforms such as routine maintenance, load balancing, scaling to handle peak demands, and saving energy. The ability to perform fast, robust, and secure live migration of VMs across physical machines is critical for flexible administration and usability of cloud infrastructure.  This research led to the development of several new live migration techniques under various configurations, as summarized below.\n\nWe developed a new multi-VM migration technique called Gang Migration with Global Deduplication for simultaneous live migration of multiple virtual machines across racks in a datacenter cluster.\n\nWe developed a new technique called Scatter-Gather migration for fast deprovisioning of servers in data centers even when the target machines are slow in receiving the VMs. We integrated inter-VM deduplication with Scatter-Gather to reduce the network and memory overhead of multi-VM migration.\n\nWe developed the Agile VM migration technique to improve responsiveness of VM migration to changes in resource pressure at the source machine.\n\nWe developed the Quick Eviction migration technique to exploit incremental snapshots and significantly reduce the time taken to evict a VM from the source node.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive study covering the comparative performance of various encryption algorithms when used with live migration of VMs using pre-copy and post-copy approaches.  Our study  uncovered dependencies between workload type, migration mechanisms, and encryption mechanisms and their combined impact on VM migration performance.\n\nWe developed the Ephemeral Virtualization technique to more efficiently transfer control of a VM among co-located hypervisor-level services.\n\nFor live migration of multiple VMs over software-defined networks (SDN), we discovered the significance of ordering the migration of VMs according to their workload types in order to reduce downtime, migration time, and performance impact on applications.\n\nWe developed HyperFresh, a fast and transparent intra-host live migration technique for live replacement of hypervisors beneath running VMs.\n\nFor failure-resilience of migration, we designed a reverse incremental checkpointing mechanism that can recover the VM state upon failure of destination during migration.\n\nTo support efficient container migration, checkpointing, and memory scrubbing, we developed the notion of a container-level address space to perform accurate tracking and customized management of container memory.\n\nTo date, this research has led to the publication of 7 conference papers, one journal paper, 2 workshop papers, one PhD Thesis, and 5 MS Thesis/projects.
