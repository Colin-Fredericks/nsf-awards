The project will develop a socio-technical model of \"organic team science\" in which scientists are motivated to collaborate across diverse scientific communities and to share and normalize data to solve scientific problems through an open framework. potentially creating new cross-disciplinary collaborations around the modelling problems. The project will advance hydrology by making already-collected geospatial data more usable for analysis and simulations. It will advance limnology by developing an integrated hydrodynamic model of lakes as connected to the broader hydrologic network to quantify water, material, nutrient and energy fluxes, which is potentially transformative for limnology. The project will be carried out with collaborators including the NSF Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory and the GLEON projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide benefits by developing cyberinfrastructure to provide access for limnology to climate and geospatial data and models as well as novel practices for supporting organic team science. The later is potentially a significant and transformative contribution to the infrastructure for science. The hydro-dynamic model could be useful for those managing lakes. The proposal includes plans for outreach to the scientific community to share these findings.",
