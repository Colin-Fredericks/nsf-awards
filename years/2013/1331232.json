 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory.  The series consists of three mini-conferences on Combinatorics and Graph Theory in Atlanta where Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University are located. Three mini-conferences will be scheduled in November, February, and April, respectively. Each conference will feature one distinguished researcher with two one-hour lectures, four one-hour lectures by distinguished researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students.  \r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of the ongoing Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory started in 2010. The featured lectures and other invited talks have covered a variety of topics in graph theory and combinatorics.  The speaker pool not only has a good gender balance but also consists of a nice blend of senior, well-known researchers and young rising stars.  The series has become a major event for combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of the United States.",
