This project will enable that the seven U.S. lead authors of AHDR-II can\r\nparticipate in critical project meetings, which are typically held in Denmark. In addition, the project will partially fund several\r\n\"town-hall meetings\" in various arctic locations (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Russia, Sweden). These meetings are being held in non-academic\r\nsettings and are intended to stimulate feedback to draft chapters of the report by arctic residents. Finally, the project will support the\r\ndissemination of results of AHDR-II by contributions to a printed report and through assistance for establishing and maintaining an\r\nAHDR-II website, where updates and other products relevant for the user-community will be posted in regular intervals.",
