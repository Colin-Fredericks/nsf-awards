 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catchments are fundamental landscape units that contain interpretable physical, chemical and\r\nbiological signals in their soils, drainage waters and ecosystems and record the effects of\r\nclimate warming, atmospheric deposition, land use shifts, catastrophic events and other global\r\nchange drivers. Catchment Science, the focus of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and\r\nGordon Research Seminar (GRS) for which we seek financial support, is a truly interdisciplinary\r\nand international endeavor conducted by hydrologists, ecologists and biogeochemists whose\r\ngoal is to explore and understand catchment response signals in order to better anticipate future\r\nchallenges facing water and ecosystem managers. The purpose of this conference is to bring\r\ntogether established and developing experts in the field of Catchment Science to share the\r\nresults of cutting-edge research, develop new collaborations, and assess where we are and\r\nwhere we need to go in order to understand the future of catchments in an era of global change.\r\n\r\nIntelletual Merit. The theme of this GRC/GRS is \"Catchments Through the Looking Glass:\r\nFrom Microscopes to Telescopes\". There is compelling evidence that global change is affecting\r\nthe physical, chemical, and biological resources of catchments in many parts of the world, and\r\nCatchment Science is increasingly at the forefront of driving our understanding of the many\r\nimplications of global change. As catchment scientists, we each have our own unique\r\nperspectives and vantage points from which we view our scientific approach and interpret our\r\ndata. This GRC/GRS will bring together leading experts in the field who will explain how their\r\nparticular vision and research environment have shaped the direction of their cutting-edge\r\nresearch and how their approaches can be useful and applicable to other scientists and endusers\r\nworking in the field. The GRC/GRS will focus on four sub-themes that span a broad range\r\nof Catchment Science perspectives: 1) \"Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes\", where we\r\nwill assess the similarities and differences of conducting catchment science in polar, boreal,\r\ntemperate, arid and tropical settings as well as the societal implication and application; \"Doors\r\nof perception\", which will consider how the scale of our scientific lens, from microscopic to\r\ntelescopic and with different levels of stakeholder involvement, shapes our understanding of\r\ncatchments; \"Animal, vegetable, mineral\", where we will explore the inextricable linkages\r\nbetween biota and the Earth's surface that help to determine catchment function and\r\nsustainability, particularly under climate change concerns; and \"Tools you can use\", which will\r\nshowcase novel analytical techniques and conceptual approaches that have revolutionized the\r\nfield. The GRC provides the ideal format for promoting better communication and understanding\r\nof the various research approaches comprising Catchment Science, allowing a more focused\r\nattack on identified issues and improved international collaboration in the future.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Our ability to successfully conduct Catchment Science in the future in\r\nresponse to global change rests largely in our ability to nurture the next generation of catchment\r\nscientists. This GRC will be immediately preceded by our second two-day Gordon Research\r\nSeminar (GRS), the participants of which will be mainly graduate students and recent advanced\r\ndegree recipients from the various fields of Catchment Science, as well as senior scientists who\r\nwill serve as mentors and discussion leaders. We expect all GRS participants will attend the\r\nGRC conference the following week, with the result of greatly increased participation of young\r\nscientists in the Catchment Sciences GRC series. We anticipate that the GRS is likely to\r\nincrease the ethnic diversity of the GRC, attesting to the continually changing demographics in\r\nCatchment Science. In addition, our invited speakers and discussion leaders are nearly half\r\nfemale, reflecting our efforts to promote gender diversity in our program. The products of these\r\nefforts include increased communication among all levels and fields of catchment scientists, as\r\nwell as the dispersal of new ideas throughout the broader scientific community.",
