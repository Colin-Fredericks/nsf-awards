 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nMaterials that undergo a Jamming-unjamming transition are ubiquitous in nature: a pile of sand, a sack of marbles, and a raft of bubbles are examples of disordered particulate systems at the edge of stability. The transition from jammed to flowing, just like the glass-transition, has many of the hallmarks of a phase transition without fitting cleanly into any existing phase transitions theories. This project will pursue a multipronged approach, combining new experimental and simulational techniques to explore jammed systems in dimensions d=2, 3 and higher. If a mean-field theory of jamming exists, it is expected that its predictions should become increasingly exact with increasing dimension.  Using newly developed simulations, this project will measure the scaling behavior of high-dimensional systems close to jamming.  These results will be used both to test the validity of the recently proposed mean-field Gaussian Replica-Theory of jammed systems as well as to develop a renormalization approach towards understanding the geometric structures of such packings.  If a full renormalization treatment is achieved, this will represent a true breakthrough in the study of jammed systems and would have broad impact for the study of jammed, glassy, and frustrated systems. This project will support the education and career development of a PhD student well versed in both cutting edge experimental and simulational science. The successful completion of these studies will provide a quantitative understanding of the geometric and mechanical phase transitions underlying the jamming transition in dimensions two, three, and higher.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nJamming is ubiquitous in nature and industry: a sand dune, a sack of grain, a pile of coal, and the powders that make medicines are all examples of disordered particulate systems at the edge of stability. They seem solid enough at first push, but give them a hard shove and they simply flow out of the way.  Yet, for all of their ubiquity, they remain poorly understood. One of the ironies of nature is that often by imagining what the world would be like in much higher dimensions, we can better understand and explain the world as it is.  Thus, studying the jamming of particles in (for example) 7 dimensions will shed light on such prosaic questions as \"How does one design a better grain hopper?\"  This project will pursue a multipronged approach to explore jammed systems in the real world, in dimensions d=2, 3 and higher. This project will: measure the static and dynamic properties of a jammed emulsion, a model system for studies of jamming; drive the state of the art forward in high speed microscopy techniques; develop new computer programs and algorithms to harness cutting-edge supercomputers and simulate the interactions of an enormous number of particles in dimensions as high as the thirteenth dimension; and support the education and career development of a PhD student well versed in both cutting edge experimental and simulational science;  pioneer a Visiting Artist program designed to spark public interest and appreciation in real science in ways that a purely scientific discourse cannot.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by this award has advanced our understanding of the Jamming transition and has also led to new discoveries of ever deeper and more fundamental links between the jamming and glass transitions.  Our work has demonstrated that these transitions are linked by an underlying Gardner transition, as predicted by mean field theories.  \n\nThis grant has resulted in 23 peer review publications, including 2 in PNAS, 6 in Physical Review Letters, and 2 in Soft Matter.\n\nSignificant achievements include:\n\na) The first direct measurement of a Gardner Phase in a physical glass, in our case a colloidal glass.  This measurement was undertaken with the use of high speed microscopy to allow for measurements of the change in the functional form of the mean square displacement of colloids moving on the nano-meter scale.  This result places the theorized Gardner transition on firm footing for thermal glasses.\n\nb) The first direct evidence of an ultrametric structure in the energy basins of jammed packings.  This result places the theorized Gardner transition on firm footing for athermal jammed packings.\n\nc) The development and measurement of a fundamental definition for the configurational entropy in jammed systems based on an extension of the Force Network Ensemble.  This work settles long standing questions about the applicability of statistical mechanical approaches to jamming in the affirmative.\n\nd) Demonstration that the mean field predictions for jammed packings have no meaningful limit of applicability, extending from high dimensional systems all the way down to 2d systems and even to systems not traditionally considered as amorphous, such as slightly polydisperse crystalline systems.\n\ne) Multiple new geometric tools with which to characterize jamming and which can serve as meaningful order parameters with which to describe the transition.\n\nf) The development and characterization of a novel two dimensional thermal system composed of chaotic Farady waves.  This system has been shown to satisfy dissipation relaxation relations and to behave as an ideal two dimensional gas.\n\nThe research supported by this award has had broad societal and educational impacts:\n\na) In addition to the fundamental scientific advances this work has lead to advances in understanding that impacts on many other fields of science and engineering.  Chiefly among them are applications to the technological development of structural glasses.\n\nb) In completing this project we have developed new GPU accelerated software for generating and interrogation jammed sphere packings in arbitrary dimensions.  This software is gaining currency within our scientific community and already has attracted many external users.\n\nb) This project has supported three visiting artists in the creation and dissemination of artist work about and in response to the jamming research done in our lab.
