 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the United States, husband-to-wife violence is widely prevalent and causes great physical and psychological harm. One in five women has been hurt by intimate partners in their lifetimes. Among them, 42 percent receive injuries and 12 percent require medical care.  Victims have more frequent hospitalizations and more visits to emergency departments, outpatient clinics, and mental health services.  Despite the devastating impact that husband-to-wife abuse has on the wives and society, there are many unresolved questions, including how women subjected to violence arrive at decisions to leave or continue their relationships. To improve understanding of the dynamics of women's decision making in violent relationships, this study will document daily patterns of violent events, perceived need for action, and the potential predictors of action over a 2-month period for each woman. The study will recruit 150 adult women attending routine office visits at six primary care clinics. Women who report abuse within the past month will complete a baseline interview and a daily telephone survey for 2 months. Daily questions will address the previous day's violence (events, stalking, perceived escalation), household environment (alcohol, stress, closeness, forgiveness), concerns (children, their safety, financial independence), perceptions (desire to \"move on\" or \"keep the family together\", ability to control violence), and perceived need for action (leaving, coping assistance, legal assistance). Weekly telephone discussions, and end-of-study qualitative and quantitative interviews will assess additional decision making factors and women's sense of safety during the study. In addition, subjects will complete baseline and end-of-study assessments of factors that may modify perceived need for action or its translation into actual action.  \r\n\r\nThis work advances our understanding about decision making in violent relationships by applying innovative methods to study the variability of women's decision making. This line of inquiry could have significant clinical applications, guiding possible interventions, by identifying factors important in decision making to abused women and explaining the variability of decision making in violent relationships. In addition, this study advances discovery and understanding by joining research and teaching, integrating project results into a workshop series for medical students by promoting novel research methods. Key innovative features include real-time reports of violent events, decision making and triggers, use of cellular phones in data collection, and assessment of day-to-day dynamics. Study results are broadly disseminated in journal publications, national professional meetings, and multidisciplinary conferences attended by policymakers and investigators. The study team has partnerships with federal agencies (i.e. the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), and is informing policy development through organizations such as the American Academy of Family Physicians. Assessing violence in real-time could empower researchers to study violence dynamics \"as it happens\" rather than limiting investigation to recall of events. There is potential for such research to improve our understanding of decision making, while positively influencing subjects' lives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive global problem.  This study was interested in how women make decisions about dealing with violence when they have abusive husbands.  Specifically, researchers wanted to know: 1) is need for action unpredictable from day-to-day?  2) Why is it unpredictable? 3) What things encourage her need for action, and 4) how might we help women take action to reduce the impact of partner violence?  To answer these questions, we asked 143 women in abusive relationships to telephone an automated survey every day for 2 months, and tell us whether violence had occurred, and whether they saw a need to take action to deal with the violence.  Before our study, more than half of these women had sought counseling, and about half left the relationship at one time.  Yet women returned, and the abuse continued.\n\n     Is need for action unpredictable?  Using their daily reports of need-for-action, we found that his violence and her need for help- seeking and for leaving were unpredictable at similar levels.  However, need for legal action was more predictable.  The need for taking action was probably unpredictable because its triggers were interconnected.  Interviews with women identified many forces that work to keep these couples together, including loyalty, responsibility, family identity and economic need, while other forces push them apart: mistreatment, disrespect, infidelity, and addiction. \n\n     Why is need for action unpredictable? Women who had done something about the violence in the past were more likely to take action during the study, and they were more ready to deal with violence in the future.  Women\u00c6s need to take action generally rose on the days after violence occurred, the day after she believed the violence was increasing, or the day after she expressed concerns about their children.  During this study, 20% of women took some action.  Women who sought help felt a sense of control the day before, but experienced a spike in stress levels on the day they contacted a counselor.  Those who left the relationship reported increasing violence and heavier husband\u00c6s drinking the day before they left, reinforced by a spike in stress levels the day they moved out.  Taking legal action was different than other actions in that it was sudden, with no same-day factors triggering it, only prior-day stalking by the husband and a concern for children\u00c6s safety. \n\n     How can physicians help women in violent relationships and encourage decision-making?   Quality decision-making involves clarifying values, identifying alternatives, obtaining necessary information, and combining them to balance heart-and-head factors to make a sound decision, and then committing to act.  The first step involves helping her to recognize the need for action; one can ask her to reflect on factors important to those specific needs (i.e. children\u00c6s safety and need for legal action) to foster a sense of need.  The next step is to prepare her for action by focusing on prior-day factors that are important to taking action. \n\n     Investigators have shared these findings with community, education, and research audiences. Upon completion of the study, investigators shared results with the physician and clinic staff at all of the clinic sites involved in the study.
