Practitioners are increasingly expected to implement &ldquo;research-based&rdquo; programming, while researchers are increasingly expected to have a &ldquo;broader impact.&rdquo; Yet, despite these apparently complementary needs, effective connections between researchers and practitioners are difficult to create and maintain. This method could provide for more effective engagement of and communication between practitioners and researchers of STEM outreach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our method piloted here was to present practitioner developed program descriptions and models to researchers in order to have the researchers identify research related to the program (see images of Example Program Information, and Example Program Pathway Model). This approach shows promise as a method to encourage the integration of research into practice. We coined this approach &ldquo;Model-Mediated Collaboration&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Measure Development: Previous research by others in the field identified the barriers to research-practice integration, factors that support research-practice integration, and the fundamentally different perspectives with which researchers and practitioners approach their work, but we found nothing that addressed the understanding each has of the other&rsquo;s work, and their attitudes towards the other, much less any study of interventions actually changing (preferably, improving) knowledge and attitudes. We developed and validated a parallel pair of measures looking at attitudes and knowledge of researchers and practitioners towards each other.&nbsp; The publication for this measure is in draft form, and was presented at the American Evaluation Association annual conference in November 2015.</li>\n<li>Using the knowledge and attitude measures developed, we determined that practitioners significantly increased in overall knowledge of research and researchers related to their area of programing; more specifically in 1) awareness of research related to their program outcomes, 2) understanding how to read a research article, and 3) knowing of research-based measurement tools relevant to the program. In addition, they said that this knowledge was moderately to very useful, and the process was not very difficult.</li>\n<li>Researchers, on the other hand, found the process to be &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo; (a 5 on a scale of 1-6). Researchers showed a non-significant drop in overall knowledge, but there was a significant decrease specifically in understanding how current programs relate to their research. This paralleled their stance that the practitioner developed resources were insufficient for helping them to understand the program. There was a small but significant decrease in researcher attitudes towards practice, more specifically in decreases in agreeing that making research more practice-based would make it less relevant to research audiences,&nbsp; and a tendency to increase a view of practitioners as &ldquo;living in their own world&rdquo;&nbsp; and being too focused on practical issues (in comparison to theoretical issues). Their purpose in participating, however, was to be helpful to practitioners, and they succeeded in that.</li>\n<li>One interesting result was in the diversity of literature identified by researchers reviewing the same programs.&nbsp; Twenty-eight researchers identified 353 resources for 10 programs (each researcher reviewed only one program), and there were only three instances where two researchers reviewing the same program identified the same article as a resource.&nbsp; Additionally, we had conducted our own Web of Science literature reviews for each of those programs, and identified 549 publications, and the overlap between literature recommended by Researchers and our literature identified in a search on Web of Science was minimal &ndash; only 19 references were in both lists.</li>\n<li>Researchers reported that&nbsp; reviews like this would make them somewhat likely to change how they implement research, and practitioners are more likely than that to change how they implement programs (see image &ndash; potential change in implementation). Some researchers noted their lower scores may reflect that they already incorporate collaboration with practitioners, so it wouldn't be a large change for them.</li>\n<li>We must keep in mind that the sample was small (10 practitioners, and 28 researchers) and it is premature to draw general conclusions.&nbsp; In general, this method shows promise of helping practitioners integrate research into their programs, and although it may increase researcher&rsquo;s feelings of being different from practitioners, we don&rsquo;t predict that it would create any new barriers to communication between these two audiences. In fact, the major recommendation for improvement of this method was to allow for direct communication between the researchers and practitioners so they could seek clarification of unclear points, and to identify areas of priority for each program. However, this was not fully supported when we inquired about interest in having a conversation between practitioners and researchers about the program. Only 40% of practitioners and 36% of researchers were interested in further communications, and there were only two programs (20%) where there was interest on both sides. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/25/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;M&nbsp;Trochim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1346848/1346848_10267999_1479479537824_sustainable-camping-id-1232--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1346848/1346848_10267999_1479479537824_sustainable-camping-id-1232--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example Program Pathway Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1346848/1346848_10267999_1479479537824_sustainable-camping-id-1232--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example Program Pathway Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is an example of a pathway model that would have been provided to Researchers.
