Specific topics that will be emphasized in INC9 are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Bridge to Medical Engineering: Bio-transistors, personal health and environmental monitoring\r\n2) Flagship projects in Europe: Brain research, Graphene Center, Large multidisciplinary centers \r\n3) Bridge to photonics: high density optical interconnects and integrated silicon photonics\r\n4) Bridge to Energy Efficiency: low energy electronics and lightning in Japan, Europe and US\r\n5) Panel on innovation in nanotechnology\r\n\r\nThe meeting will provide a unique opportunity for academics and industry leaders to interact on issues in nanotechnology. In order to further strengthen the dialogue, leaders and policy makers from a number of continents will join researchers from industry and academia to hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanosciences, along with opportunities for collaboration. Young scientists will also be invited to present posters highlighting their work.",
