 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-week summer school in Computational Number Theory will be held at the University of North Carolina Greensboro in May of 2013, 2014, and 2015.  The first summer school is scheduled for May 20-24, 2013. The subjects for each of the upcoming summer schools to be held at the University of North Carolina Greensboro are the following:\r\n- May 2013: Computational Algebraic Number Theory \r\n- May 2014: Geometry and Modular Forms \r\n- May 2015: Computational aspects of Hilbert's 12th Problem\r\nThe aim of the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number theory. This will further their knowledge and give the students additional tools for their research. Furthermore, the school will allow the students to have the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field. \r\n\r\nThe summer school will help create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field the students will lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school they will meet again at one of the regional conferences: Palmetto Number Theory Series or South Eastern Meeting on Numbers. The PIs will encourage student participation in these conferences, which will be valuable for their careers as researchers and in their post-doctoral lives. By introducing the students to a computational approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their research. More information can be found at the website for the summer school:\r\nhttp://www.uncg.edu/math/numbertheory/summerschool/",
