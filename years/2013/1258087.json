 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-dimensional structure of human organs is essential for function, and understanding how organs are constructed from cells is a huge challenge in biology. One important mechanism involves bending sheets of connected cells. A new type of cell sheet bending called 'basal constriction' has recently been discovered in the brain. This project will uncover genes necessary for basal constriction, using the zebrafish. The zebrafish is an excellent model as the embryo is transparent, allowing microscopic imaging of single cells in the living animal. It is hypothesized that a cellular communication system called the 'Wnt-PCP pathway' is essential for basal constriction. The function(s) of genes in this pathway, including one called focal adhesion kinase will be examined. A hypothesis that membrane around part of the cell is removed by a process called 'endocytosis' to constrict the cell and bend the cell sheet will be tested. This project is groundbreaking, since it brings together the disciplines of tissue structural engineering and molecular biology. Basal constriction occurs in many organs, and knowledge obtained from these studies will be pertinent for understanding organ formation and regeneration. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include trainee mentoring, training, and communicating with the public. Mentorship will include middle school students through Boston Science Club for Girls. Undergraduates will participate in this research, while graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained as effective supervisors. The PI has a special interest in encouraging young women to consider a research career, and will mentor and lead discussions for this group. The PI also has a strong interest in mentoring postdoctoral researchers, and set up an annual review process for Whitehead/MIT postdocs. Lectures on the importance of scientific inquiry and the excitement of research will be offered to lay audiences in various venues.",

We previously discovered a new way that cell sheets bend, and called this 'Basal Constriction'. The goal of this NSF project was to understand the mechanisms by which basal constriction occurs. We used the zebrafish for this study, a model system that has the advantage of being transparent, so the behavior of individual cells can be observed in the living animal. We studied basal constriction in the embryonic brain, in a region called the 'midbrain-hindbrain boundary' (MHB); however, our literature analysis indicates that basal constriction is widely used across different species, and in multiple body organs. Our 3D imaging showed that cells initially constrict basally, and later, the opposite (apical) side of the cell expands. Groups of 3-4 cells form a 'unit' of basal constriction, and simultaneously undergo this process. We identified signaling proteins, including Wnt5b and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), that we hypothesized may instruct cell sheets to undergo basal constriction. In support of this, Wnt5b and FAK are concentrated in the MHB, and inhibiting their function prevents basal constriction. This study has provided groundbreaking information relevant to the fields of developmental biology, morphogenesis and cell biology. With regard to broader impact, the project has provided significant training opportunities for all levels, from undergraduates to Ph.D. candidates to postdoctoral trainees. We have interfaced extensively with high school teachers, students and more general audiences to discuss formation of the embryo, ethical considerations in research, and the power of scientific inquiry.
