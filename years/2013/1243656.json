 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI seeks to discover novel biomaterials based on an expanding toolkit of peptide templates and porphyrin structures to create photoelectronically active nanowires. The peptides are designed to form polymers based on the coiled-coil protein structural motif, and the ability to generate these polymers is well established. These peptide-based scaffolds have been engineered to bind negatively charged porphyrins, taking advantage of well-defined ionic interactions. This research aims to significantly advance the utility of these materials by expanding the design principles to include binding of positively charged porphyrins and porphyrins with metals that have been incorporated. This expansion in design will allow for increased diversity of photoelectronic activity, and for the ability to modulate this activity. In a new direction, a natural coiled-coil structure will be tested as a scaffold for porphyrin binding. The investigator will use the coiled coil from the rod domain of myosin II to extend the lengths of the protein covalent scaffolds from the range of tens of amino acids to many hundreds of amino acids. If successful, such a scaffold will increase the length scale available for creating nanowires. This project is highly interdisciplinary in nature and will contribute to the advancement of a number of different active fields of research, including: (1) elucidating general protein folding rules and understanding polymerization processes; (2) designing photoelectronically active biomaterials; and (3) creating biomaterials that can be deposited onto surfaces for testing photoelectronic behavior. \r\n\r\nThe work described here will be driven primarily by undergraduates. Biology and chemistry students will receive broad training in the areas of biochemistry and biophysics. Many aspects of the research work, focusing particularly on protein chemistry and protein design, have been incorporated in several courses that the  PI teaches.  The PI  has a longstanding commitment to improving access to research for under-represented groups. He has been involved in several College-wide programs to provide this access, including: (1) teaching in a summer bridge program; (2) supervising and mentoring Haverford students who teach in a Saturday program that provides access to the College laboratories to high school and middle school students from Philadelphia; and (3) participating in the development of a new Office of Academic Resources, designed to provide support for students who enter with weaker skills in analytical and critical reasoning. More recently this investigator has taken leadership roles in the community for stewarding funding for student and faculty research, and generally promoting and enhancing faculty scholarly ambitions across the institution. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nThe over-arching aim of this project was to develop electronically active biomaterials at the nanoscale using biological molecules in the design.  The two principle components used in the design include filamentous and fibrillar proteins and porphyrins.  Porphyrins are the cage-like molecules that are used to bind magnesium ions, and are the principal component of chlorophyll, a molecule involved in photosynthesis.  The long-term strategy is to use such biomaterials for imprinting light-sensitive electronic activities as components of nano-scale circuits, with potential applications in biomedicine.  We reached our goal of creating designed coiled-coil protein fibrils that could bind porphyrins at micromolar concentrations and could be deposited onto surfaces while retaining such non-covalent interactions.  This work has been reviewed and published in the primary literature.  We had better success with using negatively charged porphyrins rather than positively charged ones, due to limitations of solubility of the latter porphyrin derivatives.  We also tested the use of myosin fibrils and beta-hairpin models as templates for porphyrin binding.  We dropped the work on the myosin fibrils after demonstrating that porphyrins would not bind this template, but did show that beta-hairpin fibrils bound porphyrins at least as well as the coiled-coil model system.  Finally, we identified a naturally occurring electronically conductive material from the bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens, which produces a protein called PilA that is responsible for extracting electrons from metals for intracellular redox reactions.  We collaborated with Patrick Reardon?s laboratory on developing protocols for heterologous protein expression in E. coli, protein purification, and protein refolding.  The refolded proteins were established to form fibrils with conductive properties similar to the native protein extracted from their original source, as characterized using atomic force microscopy.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe work here has helped to validate the use of proteins as templates for creating photoelectronically active filamentous and fibrillar biomaterials.  Successful design of the incorporation of photoelectronic activity through the use of porphyrins provides a toolkit for the burgeoning area of nanotechnology.  The project was driven largely by undergraduate students.  Over the funding period, 64 students participated in thesis-oriented work with the PI of which 16 students worked directly on the goals of this project.  Students working on this project shared their findings with the entire research team at weekly lab meetings during the academic year and in the summer research session.  Several of the students who have worked on this project have gone on to pursue graduate-level work in the areas of biomaterials design and nanotechnology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Fairman"
