 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) will continue its Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Summer Intern Program which offers the opportunity for ten undergraduate students each year to conduct research with scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). The primary focus of the SAO summer intern program is the student research. Intern projects are solicited from the CfA scientific staff. A wide range of research topics will be offered in the following areas: planetary and exoplanetary science, theoretical studies in astronomy and in atomic and molecular physics, the interstellar medium, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, large scale structure, active galactic nuclei, laboratory astrophysics, and detector development. Each student writes an internal research paper and gives an oral presentation of their results at an Intern Symposium held at the end of the summer. The research experience is completed by a trip to the winter American Astronomical Society meeting, where the intern presents a poster paper and interacts with other scientists. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the training interns receive by performing a focused research project, students are involved in a variety of complementary activities, including a series of six scientific colloquia given by CfA scientists at a level appropriate for undergraduates, a series of short lecture courses in cosmology and exoplanets, and several organized lunches including one with current graduate students and one with faculty members from the Astronomy Department graduate admissions committee, as well as one to discuss graduate school fellowships. Students are recruited with an emphasis on women, under-represented minorities, and students from colleges where research opportunities in astronomy are limited. \r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the National Science Foundation REU program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvery summer since 1994 the SAO/CfA summer intern program in astronomy has provided talented undergraduates with valuable training in cutting-edge astrophysics research in many subject areas, as well as direct experience in what careers in astrophysics are like.  Since its inception our program has trained a total of 240 students (124 women, 116 men, and 33 students from under-represented minorities) from 108 different colleges.  In the four years covered by award 1262851, our program supported 42 REU interns from 36 different universities (23 women, 19 men, 11 under-represented minorities) working with 34 different primary advisers.  An additional four non-US citizen students participated in our program fully supported by non-REU sources.  The intellectual merit criterion is met by the students' astrophysics research, conducted under the supervision of one or more CfA scientists.  Most interns worked with two advisers (a primary advisor and a mentor).  Each student completed a publication-style paper on her/his summer research project and described the results in a public talk at the annual CfA Summer Intern Symposium.  Each student also described her/his project to the wider astronomical community with a poster presentation at an American Astronomical Society or other national professional meeting.  Research results from the Summer 2013 - 2016 cohorts, supported by this award, have been reported in 53 posters (48 at AAS meetings, 5 at other conferences), and 11 refereed papers.  Several additional papers have been submitted for publication in refereed journals, and one is in press.  All project papers are publicly available through the Wolbach Library and/or SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS).\n\nThe program addresses the broader impact criteria through recruitment and training students from underrepresented groups, especially of women, as well as from colleges with limited opportunities for astrophysical research. All students are exposed to a range of professional development activities.  These include our weekly colloquium series, designed to give the students a broad view of astrophysics beyond their individual research projects.  The students interview and introduce the colloquium speakers.  They also participate and lead seminars and panel discussions on research ethics, graduate and undergraduate student life, graduate admissions, graduate school fellowship opportunities, and alternative career paths such as journalism, public outreach, and K-12 education.  By providing both research opportunities and role models for women and underrepresented minorities through advisors, mentors and colloquium speakers, we are helping increase diversity in the astronomy workplace.  Many former interns have completed graduate school, and are now postdoctoral scholars and faculty.  Former interns serve as a valuable resources for current interns considering their career and graduate school choices.  Since 1994, more than 80% of our alumni entered graduate school in STEM fields (astronomy, physics, math, engineering).  Finally, our program involves relatively junior researchers as advisors and mentors, broadening the pool of scientists with advising experience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christine Jones"
