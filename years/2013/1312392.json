 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this proposal is to develop multiscale models and to design controlled experiments to quantitatively study force generation due to actomyosin activity in active cytoskeletal networks and in multicellar microtissues. The biomechanical tension generated by myosin motors in the actin cytoskeleton, which is a flexible and dynamic network of filaments that is acted upon by a variety of regulatory and crosslinking proteins, is fundamental to many pathologic processes such as tumor growth, metastasis and fibrosis. Studies to be conducted under this award include: incorporation of key mechano-bio-chemical processes in a active finite-element based actin network to model contractility, development of a coarse-grained description that explicitly includes actomyosin activity to model deformation of 3D microtissues and experiments to quantitatively determine the role of actomyosin activity in different cell types where motors are localized in the cortex actin or in stress fibers and the biomechanical interplay that occurs when two cell types are mixed. \r\n\r\nIf successful, these studies would add significantly to our understanding of how elastic stresses lead to an enhancement of contractile activity in living cells. Moreover, multi-scale quantitative models that can predict the behavior of multicellular 3D systems and supporting experiments will reveal the mechanisms of force transfer through cell-to-cell in complex 3D environments. This in turn may help understand how the actin networks of multiple cells interact with each other to drive multi-cellular events critical to the function of tissues and organs such as histomorphogenesis, repair and regeneration. The award will provide an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to both carry out experimental work and to develop advanced computational and modeling skills. The progress made in the modeling methods and experimental techniques will be included in the courses that the PI and the co-PI have created to promote hands-on simulation and laboratory experience.",

Cell-derived tension depends strongly on the mechanical environment. The rigidity of the medium in which the cells are found has been shown to affect cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this project, first, through a combination of experiments and mathematical models, we find that cell-derived tension can be of sufficient magnitude to cause failure of complex-shaped microtissues. We show that failure can be controlled by varying the amount of extracellular matrix in the tissue and by tuning the stiffness of the constraining structures. Our results can aid the design of stable tissue constructs for applications in regenerative medicine. The second major contribution of our project relates to how cells can sense and respond to mechanical signals over relatively long distances across fibrous extracellular matrices such as collagen that is commonly found in many tissues. We explored all of the key factors that influence long-range force transmission in cell-populated collagen matrices: alignment of collagen fibers, responses to applied force, strain stiffening properties of the aligned fibers, aspect ratios of the cells, and the polarization of cellular contraction. &nbsp;Our work has important relevance to biological processes including development, cancer metastasis, and wound healing, suggesting conditions whereby cells communicate over long distances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vivek&nbsp;B&nbsp;Shenoy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309989787_mmc2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309989787_mmc2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cells Communicating Through Collagen Matrices\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309989787_mmc2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cells Communicating Through Collagen Matrices\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mathematical Models Show that Cells can Communicate Over Large Distances in Collagen Matrices.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vivek Shenoy</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vivek&nbsp;B&nbsp;Shenoy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cells Communicating Through Collagen Matrices</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309679740_Axon_injury1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309679740_Axon_injury1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model for Axon Injury\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1312392/1312392_10115454_1507309679740_Axon_injury1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model for Axon Injury\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) The microstructure of the axon consists of MTs cross-linked by tau proteins (springs).
