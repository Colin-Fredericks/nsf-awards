 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modules for Teaching Statistics with Pedagogies using Active Learning (MTStatPAL) provides all-inclusive modules that helps experienced and inexperienced instructors facilitate active learning lessons in teaching introductory college statistics.  The active learning lessons include scripts and video segments of experienced instructors completing the activities with students.  In this way, the project uses an innovative approach by providing a model of active learning instruction, which assists teachers in anticipating complications that could occur in implementing activity-based lessons.  \r\n\r\nEach module consists of the following components: (1) An online Pre- or Post-class Activity designed to prepare students for (or supplement) the corresponding in-class activity, which includes a video introduction to the topic, embedded quizzes, and a note-taking template.  (2) A package of Instructor Resource Materials that provides a tip sheet with a script for the lesson, a video of the in-class activity facilitated by an experienced statistics teacher, and assessment questions and solutions to evaluate students' conceptual knowledge. (3) An In-class Activity designed to promote student discourse and to help students gain understanding of a statistical concept through an active learning process.\r\n\r\nWhile there is vast literature on the benefits of active learning, there is far less on how to assist instructors, especially inexperienced ones, in effectively implementing active learning lessons.  To research the effectiveness of the materials, MTStatPAL employs design experiment methodology (Cobb, diSessa, Lehrer, & Schauble, 2003) to study how the elements of the introductory statistics learning ecology (tasks students solve, kinds of classroom discourse, norms of participation, tools used for learning, and the practical ways the teacher orchestrates relations between these elements) are impacted by the implementation of the MTStatPAL modules the project develops, shifts in student reasoning as a result of completing the MTStatPAL learning modules, as well as, how faculty adapt to teaching with the MTStatPAL learning modules.\r\n\r\nAt Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), initial implementation of the modules is taking place in the classrooms of full-time temporary faculty, graduate teaching assistants, and adjunct faculty.   A dedicated website allows for the dissemination of the project on a national and international scale.  To inform statistics educators of the availability of the active learning modules developed by MTStatPAL, the project team will share results of the project and their project materials at national statistics education events, through national digital libraries (e.g. www.causeweb.org), and through publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModules for Teaching Statistics with Pedagogies using Active Learning (MTStatPAL) is a package of technology-facilitated learning materials designed to help instructors effectively use active learning to teach important concepts in introductory statistics.  The MTStatPAL project products are listed below.\n\nA 90-page Student Workbook is used in every class period to facilitate an engaged learning environment.  This booklet includes   \n\n10 full-length in-class activities designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of statistical concepts by discussing inquiry-based questions in small groups.   Teachers facilitate group and full-class discussions to help students take ownership of their statistical learning.\nDaily Warm-ups encourage student-to-student conversations on non-activity days.  Warm-ups take 3-4 minutes and either review just-in-time topics, help student connect topics, or bring attention to strategies for improved learning. \nOut-of-class Independent Tasks use videos with embedded quizzes either before or after the class in which the active learning module is used to ensure that each student can maximize their opportunity for learning.  (Figure 1)\n\n\nA 150-plus page Teacher?s Guide includes daily lesson plans, a script of the activity, video segments of an experienced professor completing the activity with a class of students, and a solutions guide.  A common calendar has been developed to assist instructors to maximize learning materials and ensure required content is included in the course.  (Figure 2)\nA corresponding Introductory Statistics Course Community has been established at the project?s institution to help graduate teaching assistants, adjuncts, and faculty new to teaching statistics make an easier transition to teaching with these active, engaging, inquiry-based instructional materials.  Faculty meet regularly to discuss active learning, recommendations for improving instruction, and how to best use class time in terms of content and instructional approach. \nA Website (www.mtstatpal.com) freely shares all of these materials in an organized manner.  Faculty can select all the materials or just the ones they would like to use.  (Figure 3)\n\n\nAssessment of Student Learning.  MTStatPAL materials were developed and tested in general education, algebra-based, applied statistics courses, typically with 15 to 30 students, taken by a wide range of non-STEM majors.  Similar control classrooms lectured on module content.  Improvements were seen in student learning on pre and post-tests and on final exams as is shown in Table 1. (Image 4)\n\nIn particular, average pretest scores indicated that the groups which used and which did not use the MTStatPAL booklet were similar (t=0.889, p=0.374) in statistical background knowledge.  However, the post test scores indicated that groups which use the MTStatPAL workbook would score better on the posttest (t=4.631, p&lt;0.0001).  The average Improvement from pre to post test for the classes using the workbooks was 37.9 points, while the improvement for the groups not using the workbooks was 29.6 points. The difference in final exam scores for classes using the workbook was just a little more than one letter grade (51.4 without the workbook and 62.8 with the workbook), a difference which is significant both statistically and practically (t=7.420, p&lt;0.0001).  Based on these results, these materials became the basis for a full-scale course redesign at the project team?s institution to transition the course from being lecture-based to a student engaged approach. \n\nThe MTStatPAL materials have also been tested in one class of 100 students and were successful with only slight modifications.  Additionally, as part of a supplement to the original grant, the materials were tested at a two-year institution and were found to be appropriate for this audience as well.  The instructors who have successfully used the materials range in experience from tenured statistics faculty to graduate assistants to mathematics faculty with little experience teaching statistics. \n\nAssessment of Instructional Changes.  To understand the impacts holistically, a mixed-methods embedded case study was used to \"tell the complete story\" (Creswell &amp; Plano, 2011) of the modules implementation.  On a feedback survey, faculty were in agreement that the level of content in the modules was appropriate for introductory statistics classrooms, the in-class activities were easy to use, and that the supporting materials for faculty were helpful.  Our study indicated that when fully implemented, the MTStatPAL materials provide opportunities for students to reason and make meaning of important statistical concepts. \n\nAn analysis of observation and interview data found that faculty differ in their implementation of instruction with regard to the ways that they utilized small group and whole class discussions. Faculty who more fully implemented active learning facilitated student learning by eliciting and using student thinking to inform instructional decisions.  We consistently found that faculty struggle with how to do this, and they frequently requested professional development on this topic.  Moments of full implementation were marked by teachers sharing mathematical authority with students during instruction.  Maintaining the balance of encouraging students to make meaning on their own yet not degenerating into unproductive struggle proved to be an enduring challenge for active learning classrooms.
