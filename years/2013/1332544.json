 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project in the College of Engineering, Technology & Physical Sciences at Alabama A&M University (AAMU) will enhance the engineering and technology curriculum by integrating theoretical and hands-on experiences in the field of renewable energy. This will be achieved by introducing new undergraduate and graduate courses in solar, wind and other renewable energies; introducing hands-on laboratory experience in solar and wind energy; enhancing the quality of education by introducing and expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities; and strengthening the recruitment, retention and transition of engineering and science students from secondary to post-graduate studies and industry. \r\n\r\nProject activities will advance the knowledge of the student participants, sharpen their skills and provide a support system that empowers them to successfully graduate and succeed in a competitive job market. By integrating theory, lab experiences and research into multidisciplinary renewable energy courses, students will be engaged in the learning process. The project will impact more than two hundred students at AAMU, as well as about four hundred high school students. Project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen their engineering and technology programs.",
