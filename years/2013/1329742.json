 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the formulation of a data model, and trajectory planning platform and methodology to execute a fully digital 3D, 5-axis machining capability. Research will be performed on methods for utilizing multiple Graphical Processor Units (GPUs), which are readily available, parallel digital processing hardware, in these calculations. The methodology will be implemented in the context of an existing advanced computational framework that has tools for voxelization, variable resolution digital modeling, and parallel computing, integrating the fields of manufacturing and computer science. Experiments involving 5-axis machining will be executed to validate the methodology. Components will be machined and inspected on a coordinate measurement machine to verify that the target geometry has been achieved.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will bring classical subtractive manufacturing back into the arsenal of rapid prototyping, providing users of typical CNC machine tools with the ability to rapidly determine if a part can be produced on a specific machine and machine the part. Having such a design and analysis tool will help to reduce the cost, improve the quality and allow rapid deployment of new innovations in components that require machining. This work will contribute to variable resolution digital representations to be employed in next generation digital manufacturing systems. It will also combine state-of-the-art concepts in computing and manufacturing to realize a completely new a cyber-physical approach to manufacturing.",

In the 1980&rsquo;s digitizing one dimensional (1D) sound signals enabled the transition from analog recordings (LPs) to CDs. Data compression, data processing and connectivity created a wide variety of markets including the digital music market, and democratized that market. Within a few years after the 1D data digital revolution, lower cost memory, increased processing power and higher capacity and wireless connectivity led the 2D data digital revolution (<em>e.g.</em>, pictures and videos). This research takes the natural next step in this data revolution to 3D data. The basis for this work is the use of voxels, which can be considered small 3D blocks that are used to build a 3D representation of a product, much in the same manner that pixels are 2D squares that can be combined into images.</p>\n<p>This research formulated a data model, and trajectory planning platform and methodology to execute a fully digital 3D, 5-axis machining capability. The work was performed on Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) platforms that are readily available, parallel digital high performance computing (HPC) hardware designed and produced in the United States. Fundamentally, the intellectual merit of this work is the formulation of the path planning process for complex machine tools into a format that allows digital technology (GPUs) to be leveraged in a parallel fashion. Just as the GPUs drive video screens for high resolution graphics (computer aided design and games), our work utilizes the GPU and voxels models to drive advanced machine tools enabling the production of complex parts such as turbine blades employing a simple and intuitive gaming type interface. This approach enables novice machinists to easily program some of the most complex machine tools presently available on the market, helping to transform makers into manufactures (m2m).</p>\n<p>The results of this work have been demonstrated on a variety of more classical machine tools (<em>e.g.</em>, lathes and mills). These systems are typically thought of as &ldquo;old school&rdquo; machines when compared to additive manufacturing systems (<em>e.g.</em>, 3D printers). In fact such classical systems are employed to produce the bulk of the metal components used in a most products. These machines produce parts by cutting them out of metal; thus, they represent a <em>subtractive</em> process, as opposed to an <em>additive</em> process where the material is added to the part. This research leverages new voxel based models and HPC to bring subtractive manufacturing closer to the concept of the print button. The print button, in additive manufacturing, is the button that one pushes to print a part. Of course, such a button is a bit of a myth as significant process planning and post processing are necessary even for additive manufacturing. None-the-less, this research has moved us closer to the print button for making components on complex machine tools via subtractive manufacturing. As an example of this, students in a large undergraduate class at Georgia Tech utilized SculptPrint, a voxel based design and manufacturing program, to design components for production on our machine tools. The students used SculptPrint, running on Georgia Tech&rsquo;s cloud servers, augmented with GPU systems from our partner NVidia, receiving near real-time feedback on their designs regarding the producibility of their parts.

Furthermore, such parts can be made of any material that is machinable (<em>e.g</em>., steel, titanium, aluminum, etc.) and in typically less time than additive manufacturing. As a demonstration for the class, digital yo-yos were designed and mass produced by the class ME 2110, Creative Decisions and Design, a second year mechanical engineering class at Georgia Tech.
