 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating shrinkage reducing admixture formulations to fill technology gaps in the construction industry wherein more durable concrete is needed for repair and maintenance and construction of new infrastructure.   The translated technology has the following unique features: rapid identification of new target compounds with high activity for reducing shrinkage and associated cracking of concrete that provides exemplary cost savings in the development stage as well as the ability to identify new and non-intuitive molecular structures for a given application with improved performance when compared to the leading competing technology in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by applying computer aided molecular design (CAMD) technology resulting in the identification of new compounds with improved characteristics for use as shrinkage reducing admixtures in concrete; the efficacy of which will be demonstrated on a prototype-scale concrete slab.  The partnership engages Tennessee Technological University (TTU), the University of Akron (UA) and technology consultant Mr. Hugh Cameron to provide guidance in the concrete construction materials industry and other aspects related to market development, licensing, business planning and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the new technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to be a reasonable market share of the existing shrinkage reducing admixture sales in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the concrete admixture market space.   The societal impact, long term, will be to improve the performance of concrete infrastructure and thereby save potentially billions of future dollars in lost time and energy consumption due to avoided early and premature repair and maintenance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is no secret that our concrete infrastructure needs repair and that new concrete yet to be placed must be sustainable and perform better than the materials that preceded it.  One problem that has eluded the modern concrete industry is the problem of cracking.  Cracks form in concrete for many reasons, among these is shrinkage.  While it is hard to believe that concrete shrinks, in fact, it shrinks as it hardens due to processes called \"autogenous mechanisms,\" and it shrinks later due to drying.  Both of these processes are at least in-part related to the fact that water has a very high surface tension.  Have you ever seen an insect walking on water?  To an insect, the water\u00c6s surface is something like a trampoline is to us.  The tension in the trampoline\u00c6s surface supports even heavy objects.  Surprisingly, the tension in the surface of water is so great that when distributed over a large area, such as the surface within the porosity of concrete, it can actually produce enough force to pull-in on the concrete and make it shrink.  Researchers at Tennessee Technological University (TTU) and the University of Akron (UA) have shown that they can identify specially designed molecules that will reduce the surface tension of water and produce less shrinkage in concrete.  What is unique about this work is that it is utilizing, for the first time, a process called Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD).  CAMD uses information about how known substances behave, encodes their molecular structure and relates it to their performance and then uses that information to predict new molecules with expected improved performance.  This technique greatly reduces the search possibilities and provides a focused way to quickly and cost effectively advance technology to improve many applications such as how concrete performs.  What does this mean for the average person?  Congested roads alone cost Americans $101 billion annually in wasted time and fuel.  Such costs can be reduced by avoiding repairs through the use of advanced technologies that extend the life of concrete materials used for paving and highway structures.\n\n \n\nAs a result of our work, our team has successfully identified a new family of shrinkage reducing substances and is presently pursuing intellectual property (IP) protection and the formation of a small business to market our materials.  We are seeking partners and early adopters on an on-going basis to establish an entry-point into the competitive business of concrete admixtures.  Our new compounds have two unique properties.  First and foremost, the new compounds reduce shrinkage.  In addition, our new compounds tend to retain strength and in some cases even improve strength of concrete within the first few day.  This time period is critical since construction crews typically seek high early strengths so that other work can continue as quickly as possible after placing the concrete.\n\n \n\nIn addition to our new family of compounds, the faculty team has mentored a group of six engineering students in the science of admixture design and art of business development.  These students, two of which have now graduated and taken jobs in industry, have been well-served by this grant investment and are uniquely prepared to translate inventions into innovation using entrepreneurship skills learned as part of this project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph J Biernacki"
