 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to further develop large range nanopositioning technology. A nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system that is capable of nanometer-level precision, and is commonly used in scanning probe microscopy and lithography. Current nanopositioning systems are limited in their motion range to approximately 100 microns per axis, thereby restricting their use in some industrial applications. Research conducted by the project team has helped make large range (>10mm) nanopositioning feasible via innovations and scientific advances in flexure bearings, sensors, actuators, and controls.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of this project are to further refine this nanopositioning technology to determine product specifications in terms of overall size, motion range, speed, precision and resolution that meet market needs and using this information, develop a detailed CAD design of the technology that leverages the team's on-going research with product-specifications that fit with societal needs.\r\n\r\nA nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system comprising a flexure bearing, actuator(s), sensor(s), and feedback controls, and is capable of nanometer-level precision and resolution. It provides the scanning motion between a substrate and a probe in every scanning probe lithography and microscopy technique. Via previous and on-going research, the research team has established the feasibility of large-range (10mm) multi-axis (XY) nanopositioning. This represents a 100 times increase in stroke and 10,000 times increase in the scanning area coverage, compared to current technologies.",

Subsequent customer discovery in other application areas as well as Most Viable Product (MVP) development was carried out until March 30, 2014. In all, our team conducted 100 interviews in 6 weeks during the I-Corps course, and since then has reached over 150 interviews. This process resulted in several pivots and a validated potential customer and business model canvas for a viable business opportunity. During the customer discovery process, the two initially most promising customer segments for our nanopositioning technology: atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron beam lithography (EBL), as well as a third discovered during the course, nanoindentation, were tested via interviews to evaluate the degree of a product/market fit. It was found that the first customer segment has a smaller, yet real, need which fits well with the current HIPERNAP product. The latter two customer segments were found to have poor product/market fit and/or additional constraints, ruling them out as markets to pursue. During the customer discovery process, several other customer segments were discovered which warrant further testing due to their promise. In November 2013 a significant pivot was made to address validated needs in the semiconductor metrology and inspection markets and is currently being pursued. To demonstrate and validate our value proposition, a detailed CAD design of a marketable product that leverages the on-going NSF funded research by the PI was created, along with simulation models for accurate performance estimates and manufacturing costs.
