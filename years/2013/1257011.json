Dagstuhl hosts more than 3000 internationally renowned researchers each year in Germany, in seminars on the important topics and the recent developments in computer science and its application to science, technology, and society.  Many of these seminars are organized with the participation of researchers from the United States. \r\n\r\nThis award provides support for the participation of US-based junior faculty researchers in the Dagstuhl seminars and activities. It offers them the opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the world in a collegial setting during the weeklong seminars and gain valuable experience with the larger scientific community.  It is a competitive process of selection, providing support for an estimated 80 scholarships annually for three years, open to all Dagstuhl seminars.",
