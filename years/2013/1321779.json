 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators design explicit sensing matrices in concert with signal processing algorithms that outperform the state of the art. They progress towards solutions of several of the most significant open problems in compressed sensing and frame theory: (a) to find deterministic constructions of matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP); (b) to construct real and complex equiangular tight frames (ETFs), including the maximal ETFs conjectured to exist by Zauner; (c) to design fast and reliable algorithms for phase retrieval;(d) to prove recent refinements of Wright's conjecture regarding the minimal number of injective intensity measurements; (e) the Paulsen problem: How to project onto the manifold of unit norm tight frames (UNTFs).\r\n\r\nThreat detection requires high-quality sensing and effective signal processing algorithms.  Most modern threats have faint signatures, leaving intelligence agencies with two main problems.  First, you can't find what you don't seek.  That is, in order to detect a threat, you must first adequately sense the region of interest.  Because of this, part of the work focuses on new mathematics that will improve sensing capabilities.  This has the unfortunate side-effect of adding to the existing fire hose of data, exacerbating the second main problem: \"finding a needle in a haystack.\"  At the moment, analysts must wade through unimaginably large data sets in order to extract actionable intelligence.  As such, the remainder of the work focuses on new mathematical ways of processing big data sets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPart of this work focused on optimal packings of subspaces of Hilbert spaces.  There was substantial progress in addressing the following fundamental problem: given a Hilbert space of a given dimension, how should we arrange a given number of subspaces of given dimension so that the smallest distance between any pair of subspaces is as large as possible?  This problem arises in several real-world applications, including quantum information theory (quantum computing), coding theory (communications) and compressed sensing (remote sensing).  This work provided numerous new explicit constructions of equiangular tight frames (ETFs), which are optimal packings of lines, achieving the classical Welch bound.  In particular, it was discovered the first new infinite family of real ETFs to be found in more than two decades (Tremain ETFs), and drew numerous new connections between ETFs and various types of combinatorial designs, including strongly regular graphs, association schemes, distance-regular covers of complete graphs, hyperovals in projective planes, and generalized quadrangles.  Importantly, whereas previous work in this area has focused exclusively on using known combinatorial designs to construct ETFs (i.e., using pure mathematics to solve applied math problems), this work also does the opposite, using application-inspired ideas from harmonic analysis to solve some open problem in the pure mathematical field of combinatorial design. \n\n \n\nIn many engineering applications the phase of a signal is lost during processing.  Phase retrieval is the problem of recovering the lost phase.  Phase retrieval has applications to speech recognition, quantum state tomorgraph, x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and much more.   In this project, an extensive study of phase retrieval was made answering a long list of longstanding open problems in the field. \n\n \n\nQuantum detection is fundamental to quantum information theory.  In this project, a complete solution of the frame quantum detection problem is given including the quantum injectivity problem and the quantum range analysis problem.  The project solved both the real and complex cases and both the finite and infinite dimensional cases.\n\n \n\nAnother new idea was introduced:  Associating vectors in C^n with rank 2 projections in R^{2n}.  This was a major breakthrough in frame theory and immediately solved 4 longstanding open problems in the field and is being further developed to answer many more problems in the field.\n\n \n\nThere was also an extensive study of biangular and equiangular tight frames.  These frames have application to quantum information theory (quantum computing), coding theory (communications) and compressed sensing (remote sensing). \n\n \n\nThree post-docs and 6 RAs were supported and their received extensive instruction on how to go out into the mathematics community and become a successful researcher. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter G Casazza"
