 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a force sensitive solution for touch applications that will overcome the technical shortcomings of currently available technologies. The design utilizes the sensitivity, size, and cost advantages of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in a novel configuration to prevent overloading of the sensor for large applied forces. The solution will enable truly force sensitive touch that is low cost and highly sensitive. It will be operable with any object, including fingernails, gloves, and styluses, while not being susceptible to environmental factors that hinder current capacitive technologies, such as dirt and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is pertinent to a wide array of applications, including force sensitive buttons for consumer electronics, automotive controls, and force sensitive displays for fixed and mobile devices. Two decades ago, touch technology was primarily found within ATMs and point-of-sale systems. More recently, the technology migrated to other electronic industry verticals, including one of the largest and certainly the fastest growing ? smartphones and tablet PCs. Consumer demand is driving an explosion of applications in every vertical. There is increasing demand for low cost, low power, more feature rich touch solutions. In addition, new user experience benefits such as force sensitivity are constantly being pursued, yet there is no viable solution yet on the market. Such a technology would be poised to capture significant market share from existing technologies in all of these relevant verticals.",
