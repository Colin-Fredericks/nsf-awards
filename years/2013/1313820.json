 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on improving estimates of emissions from the most frequently and widely burned areas on Earth, the savanna in Africa.  Savanna fires emit large quantities of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles.  While it is increasing recognized that these fires play an important role in the global carbon cycle, there are few accurate estimates of their emissions and none from West Africa which is that continent's most active fire region. This interdisciplinary research project will develop a model of emission dynamics to determine how emissions change over time by linking changes in the fire regimes to changes in land-use and land-cover patterns.  Available estimates of emissions from savannas contain high levels of uncertainty, because they have been based on very broad generalizations of complex landscapes.  To improve emissions estimates, the investigators will use a new approach to develop a model based on the actual burning practices of people who set fires.  Building on an existing database, they will develop a system to classify savanna vegetation types as defined by fire users and link this classification scheme to fire maps derived from satellite imagery.  These data will be combined with field-based measurements of emissions of key greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane.  These data will be analyzed and combined with data on changes in land use and cover to develop a model of how emissions change over time.  The results of these analyses will produce one of the first accurate estimates of emissions from the heavily burned West African savanna, which will be used to quantify the sources of error in existing emissions estimates. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide a new model of emissions built on the practices of African fire users as well as one of the first models of fire regime dynamics based on land-use and land-cover changes in Africa.  Project results will be used to predict changes in fire emissions from the African continent, with the new models producing results that will provide valuable and accurate data for those attempting to improve global models of emissions from fire.  The project will yield much-needed local-scale information regarding fire regimes by disclosing those areas associated with high uncertainties in the global-scale models of emissions and by suggesting ways to improve them. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change requires that emissions estimates include an assessment of uncertainties. This project will provide such an estimate.  The project will strengthen research capacities by facilitating graduate research.  It will facilitate collaborative relationships between U.S. and African researchers.  The investigators will help conduct \"fire seminars\" to disseminate results in the study region with the goal of improving local and regional fire management efforts that are currently hampered by a lack of data.  The seminars will provide a forum to explore more effective ways of disseminating scientific information to local residents in regions far beyond the study area.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.",

Savanna fires annually emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, including, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>, but estimates of the quantities of these gases vary widely.&nbsp;Moreover, depending on the type and timing of the fires, they can dramatically reduce the growth of trees which has additional implications for climate change. To improve emissions estimates, this study used a novel approach to develop a model based on the actual burning practices of people who set fires. Our team conducted over 200 control burns in Malian savannas to estimate fire impacts and emissions as a function of various key factors including time of year, fuel moisture, weather conditions, fire type and vegetation type. We recorded data on emissions using a portable gas analyzer. We also collected data on the impacts of the fires on vegetation. Finally, the project focused on technology transfer to numerous African scholars both faculty and students.</p>\n<p>The project produced 5 key outcomes. First, we created fire maps documenting the regular annual temporal and spatial patterns of fires for our specific study areas as well as for the broader West African region (figures 1 and 2). This outcome is critical as it demonstrates that the pattern of burning found in our study area holds true for the larger region. That is, people regularly set fires to the same vegetation types at approximately the same time of year. This is important because it allows us to generalize our findings for a larger area as well as for a longer time period.</p>\n<p>Second, we used a landscape ecology approach to examine the patterns of fires and to compare these with vegetation patterns. We used landsat satellite data with 30-meter pixels to determine the impact of increasing landscape fragmentation on the fires. We found that areas with specific vegetation cover types tend to burn earlier or later in the fire season when compared with others as expected; however, we also found that more fragmented landscapes tend to burn earlier regardless of vegetation type. Interestingly, our study found that diversity of patches does not influence fire timing but increasing heterogeneity and smaller patch sizes do matter. Finally we found that an increase in agriculture results in earlier fires. These findings are important because an earlier fire regime has numerous ecological benefits and is probably less damaging to savanna tree cover and we expect fires to be set earlier as agriculture expands.</p>\n<p>Third, we analyzed the results for the over 200 controlled fires using a statistical package to show that fire intensity is less a function of fire season (as was previously thought) and more a function of fire type (wind direction) and fuel type (biomass amount and composition of fuels). We found that for the case of head-fires (where the wind drives the fire) that there is no correlation between fire season or weather conditions and fire intensity, whereas there is with back-fires (figure 3). We also found important differences between the intensities of randomly lit fires and those lit according to the local practices. Indeed, we found no correlation between fire intensity and fire seasonality when fires are set according to local practices because people time fires according to vegetation moisture levels. The latter finding was surprising as it goes against the common savanna ecology theory; however, our study is the only one we are aware of that considered both fire direction and fire timing based on when people are known to actually set fires in the study area as opposed to past studies which were based on assumptions of fire timing (figure 4).</p>\n<p>Fourth, while unfortunately the final analysis of our emissions data is not yet complete (due to the difficulties of life in West Africa) we have built a dataset that will allow us to compare measurements of the emissions from fires with all of the key variables including fire intensity, season, weather, fuel type, fire type etc. We expect to find that, as was the case with fire intensity results, emissions from fires vary as a function of fire type more so than fire season or weather conditions.</p>\n<p>Finally, fifth, this project resulted in the broadening of educational opportunities for five African university students and two university professors. The members of our research team were trained in a variety of field and computer-based techniques. These included the use of portable gas analyzers to study fire emissions as well as UAV (unoccupied aerial vehicles) to gather remotely sensed data for mapping different savanna vegetation types at high spatial resolution. These technologies remain in the field in Africa where they have become part of a second funded research project (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>Note the system failed to add figures to the report.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;Laris</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/1313820_10261755_1496331792966_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/1313820_10261755_1496331792966_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/1313820_10261755_1496331792966_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Measuring emissions from a savanna fire in Mali 2014</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laris, P</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;Laris</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 1-cap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 1-cap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 1-cap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 2-cap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 2-cap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 2-cap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 3-cap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 3-cap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 3-cap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 4-cap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 4-cap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313820/Figure 4-cap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
