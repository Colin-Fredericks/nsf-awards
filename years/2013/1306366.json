 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Steven Neshyba at the University of Puget Sound. The research project supports laboratory and theoretical studies into the surface morphology of rough crystalline ice. It is known that when ice crystals in atmospheric clouds (such as cirrus clouds) develop rough surfaces, the clouds tend to reflect more light. Critical details about this roughening remain elusive. This Research in an Undergraduate Institution (RUI) award will grow ice crystals inside a variable pressure scanning electron microscope, which will allow characterization of surface morphology at a resolution not possible using light microscopy. These investigations will assess the response of roughening to variations in temperature, vapor supersaturation, and impurities at the ice-vapor interface, and will provide the basis for modeling the shortwave scattering properties of such crystals. In terms of theory, an integrated molecular dynamics and reaction-diffusion approach to simulating the dynamics of viscinal ice-vapor interfaces will be developed. These simulation results will be used to test hypotheses about the mechanism of formation, morphological properties, and light-scattering consequences, of rough ice. \r\n\r\nUndergraduates at the University of Puget Sound, as well as science teachers from Sammamish High School, will be engaged in the research as co-investigators and co-authors of scientific publications, and through collaboration with researchers at the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. High school teachers will be funded to do research in Dr. Neshyba's laboratory. This will help them to develop problem-based learning modules in their classrooms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt has long been suspected that the facets of ice crystals comprising cirrus clouds are rough, but direct quantitative measurement of that roughness has proven to be an elusive goal. Investigators funded by this NSF grant were able to make such measurements by growing ice crystals inside a scanning electron microscope, resulting in three-dimensional representations of the ice surface such as that shown in Figure 1. Representations such as these offer the potential of helping atmospheric scientists interpret remote-sensing measurements of clouds, and helping climate scientists predict the role of ice clouds in Earth?s climate system.\n \nInvestigators also examined the dynamics of ice at the ice-air interface, using a modeling technique called molecular dynamics, or MD. MD simulations revealed a surprising complexity in the way molecules that are loosely bound to the surface move around &ndash; in some cases, asymmetrically, as shown in Figure 2.
