 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and evolution of the Eastern North America margin are the focus of this GeoPRISMS community seismic experiment. The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. \r\n\r\nA year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This  project examined the initiation and evolution of the Eastern North  America margin, and included data collection to understand how tectonic,  magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interacted to form the  current margin.  The project involved collection of a community seismic  data set, including data recorded from both short period and broadband  seismic arrays and multi-channel seismic reflection and refraction  surveys in a 400x500 m region off of the coast of North Carolina.  This  seismic data was made immediately open for public use.  Data from the  30-station broadband seismic array can be used to study the deep  structure of the margin in the crust and mantle.  The short period ocean  bottom seismometer, reflection and refraction data is useful for  illuminating structure in the shallow part of the continental shelf,  slope and coastal plain related to the sedimentary structure of the  region. \nThe  project also involved training of students and early career scientists  to both collect and use ocean bottom seismometer and multi-channel  reflection data.   Each cruise presented an opportunity for students and  postdocs to apply to work on the cruise and two short courses were held  to teach students to use multi-channel seismic and wide-angle  reflection/refraction data.  Additionally, the project provided the  chance for three early-career faculty to have their first experience in  collecting offshore data. The data benefit society because they can be  used to study shelf slope stability and other issues related to  geohazards. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul J Wiita"
