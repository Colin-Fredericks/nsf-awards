 "awd_abstract_narration": "Influence of Redox Environment on the Self-Assembly of Cephalopod Proteins\r\n  \r\nCephalopods can alter their skin's coloration, pattern, texture, and reflectivity to communicate with other members of their species and to blend into their environment. These remarkable abilities are conferred by specialized cells known as iridophores, which contain optically active platelets from unique structural proteins. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that govern the organization and assembly of these platelets remain poorly understood. The proposed work will explore the influence of the redox environment and amino acid sequence on the self-assembly of cephalopod proteins into nano- and micro-scale aggregates, which will be characterized via physical techniques. Such studies will simultaneously provide fundamental insight into structural coloration and the camouflage capabilities of cephalopods.\r\n\r\nPart of this research effort will establish a Biomaterials Self-Assembly Summer School (BMSS). This school will specifically enhance the research and education infrastructure available to high school and undergraduate students from STEM underrepresented groups. BMSS will include teaching, training and learning in an interdisciplinary setting, while simultaneously providing students with access to unique facilities, instrumentation, and resources. The education efforts will be broadly disseminated through press releases and a web site designed for the general populace. The proposed outreach plan will potentially establish a new strategy for experiential learning at the interface of biology and the physical sciences.",
