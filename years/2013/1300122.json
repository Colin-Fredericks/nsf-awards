 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John P. Caradonna of Boston University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate new oxidation processes that directly utilize dioxygen in sustainable metal-based systems that preclude non-selective free-radical chain reactions. This research develops and characterizes a family of mononuclear iron complexes that utilize dioxygen (4-5 turnovers) in the production of an iron-based reactive species that is capable of oxidizing carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in the presence of sacrificial two-electron donor ligands such as -keto acids.  The research focuses on two fundamentally different, although related aspects of alkane oxidation: 1) the development of a molecular-level understanding of the mechanism by which these mononuclear non-heme ferrous complexes activate dioxygen to form a metal-based oxidant, and 2) the creation of second-generation complexes that will support the general synthetic use of the formal oxygen-atom transfer reactivity of these systems. The use of iron in these catalytic systems is particularly attractive as this metal is earth-abundant and non-toxic and thus, this effort opens new avenues in inexpensive and sustainable catalytic transformations of interest to industry. Overall, the effort results in a deeper understanding of fundamental reaction chemistry and leads to the development of useful reagents for the controlled oxidation of substrates such as alkanes and arenes. \r\n\r\nProfessor Caradonna and his research group actively participate in the NSF-funded PROSTARS Program in which community college students perform research in biological/chemical oriented laboratories.  His laboratory also offers research opportunities to students at the earliest level possible, and annually participates in the Boston University's High School Research Internship Program in Science and Engineering.  Finally, the investigator mentors and encourages recent Ph.D. graduates whose graduate careers have shown their potential for future excellence in both chemistry teaching and research though Boston University's Postdoctoral Faculty Fellow (PFF) program. Together, the research activities and educational projects generate a wide range of experiences, depth of knowledge, environmental and industrial insights, and communications skills necessary for the development of next generation scientists with interests in sustainable chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n                  The direct utilization of O2 in the controlled oxidation of organic substrates remains an area of intense interest in the chemical community owing to both economic and ecological reasons. Research over the past century has only partially solved many of the fundamental issues behind the productive activation of O2 and its use. However, advances in mechanistic and structural/spectroscopic metalloenzymology have generated a new understanding of how Nature activates small molecules.  Based on these insights, we have developed a series of iron complexes that mimic two fundamental process exhibited by a subset of non-heme iron enzymes: (i) the efficient two-electron reduction of dioxygen and formation of a metal-based oxidant viathe conversion of a bound &alpha;-ketoacid to CO2 and the corresponding carboxylic acid, and (ii) the reaction of the metal-based oxidant with substrate to regenerate the catalyst. The use of iron is particularly attractive as this metal is earth-abundant and relatively non-toxic, thus opening new avenues in inexpensive and sustainable catalytic transformations of interest to the chemical community.  Although alkanes and biological materials are attractive feedstocks, their use is currently restricted primarily to fuels because of the limited number of available reactions for their modification. The proposal sponsored research efforts designed to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental reaction chemistry and consequently lead to the generation of a useful reagent for the controlled air oxidation of substrates such as alkanes and arenes. We used a cyclical combination of state-of-the-art experimental, spectroscopic, and modern computational simulations to characterize the intimate mechanistic steps in order to develop catalysts with enhanced and selective reactivity properties.  These studies led to the development of a unique \"academic\" iron-based catalyst that rapidly coordinates to a variety of small molecule a-keto acids (biological coenzymes) to form 1:1 complexes that show significantly enhanced (&gt;500 fold) oxygen sensitivity only when the iron center coordinates to the a-keto acids (making them \"user friendly\"). This initial oxygen adduct rapidly decomposes the bound a-keto acid ligand to CO2 and the corresponding carboxylate ligand, thereby generating an Fe-based reactive intermediate that is capable of oxidizing alkanes to alcohols, alcohols to ketones/aldehydes, olefins to epoxides, performing desaturation reactions, and converting phenols to phenoxyl radicals which, if possible, undergo subsequent carbon-carbon bond formation.  The observed product distributions are not sensitive to excess oxygen radical scavengers, suggesting the absence of such uncontrollable species in the chemical transformation.  This homogeneous catalyst is highly efficient, utilizing oxygen from air at ambient temperatures and pressures while performing anywhere from 50-800 turnovers at rates greater than 5 per second before inactivating via an irreversible dimerization pathway.  These data supported our preliminary efforts to enhance the catalyst lifetime (and hence its commercial utility) by synthesizing surface-immobilized versions of the catalyst on a variety of heterogeneous macroporous supports, thereby decreasing the potential for catalyst inactivation by dimerization and allowing flow technology to be utilized for these oxidation reactions. This work led to the successful application of a chemical patent (Green Oxidation Catalytic System, received 2015, PCT Application No. PCT/US2015/066736).  \n\n                  The work supported by this proposal afforded outstanding opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in a collaborative learning environment.
