 "awd_abstract_narration": "Where species live changes through time -- for example, mountains may rise, dividing one species into distinct populations, or a small group of individuals may hitch a ride in ballast water and start spreading within a new geographic area. To investigate the history of species through time, scientists often represent possible histories as models and compare the fit of observed data to these models. This grant will develop new modeling methods and software to allow scientists to test alternative, complex models that best fit observed data for various groups of organisms. A test case, using North American bats, will help ensure that the new software can accommodate various types of data effectively.\r\n\r\nThis work has practical importance because the new methods can be used to help identify sources of invasive species. It is also important in conservation because these methods will provide information about whether a species in different river systems is one or multiple populations, whether hybridization is occurring between two related species, and what the effective population size of a species has been through time. Graduate students and postdoctoral students will be trained in these methods as well.",

To infer this history, biologists have utilized analytical models that simplify the historical demography of the focal organism, for example by assuming or ignoring ongoing gene flow between populations or by requiring a priori specification of speciation history. Since an analytical model that includes all possible parameters would be too complex to function under any computational framework that is currently available, software packages for analyzing genetic data incorporate a small number of parameters, and researchers rely on intuition to choose the models that they use to analyze their data. Thanks to the funding provided by the National Science Foundation, we developed PHRAPL, software that enables evolutionary geneticists to identify an analytical model that is appropriate for the genetic data collected from their unique empirical system. PHRAPL operates by quickly estimating the approximate probability of any number of analytical models, and then choses the model that minimizes the information loss using Information Theory. <br /><br />In order to explore the intuitive choices made by researchers during the process of data analysis, we applied PHRAPL in the reanalysis of data from previously published empirical&nbsp; investigations. Prior to our work, scientists were forced to rely on their intuition as when selecting analytical models, which appears to work well only in systems that have been intensively investigated. Analyses indicate that intuition is often inadequate in previously understudied systems, as demonstrated by Figure 1. Our results suggest that objective approaches to identify phylogeographic model can augment researcher intuition to improve phylogeographic inference. <br /><br />PHRAPL will improve the results and inferences in other federally-funded projects that utilize genetic data. Because analytical model with a poor fit to the data produce inaccurate estimates of the parameters that form the basis of the inferences made by biologists, PHRAPL will improve these inferences. Our simulations suggest that PHRAPL performs well, producing similar probabilities via our approximations as those that can be computed analytically via equations for only a small portion of the possible models (Figure 2). PHRAPL has immediate applications in the identification of cryptic species (Figure 3) and the investigation of complex and understudied empirical systems (Figure 4). <br /><br />This project resulted in the comprehensive training of one postdoctoral scientist and one graduate student, who participated in the development, testing, and description of PHRAPL. To date, we have published three manuscripts describing this work, and have 2 others in review at this time. Broader impacts include the training of 65 other biologists via several PHRAPL workshops, and the improved inferences that will result from the application of an automated approach to model selection.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bryan&nbsp;C&nbsp;Carstens</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257784/1257784_10234439_1493294433857_TrianglePlot_arrows--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257784/1257784_10234439_1493294433857_TrianglePlot_arrows--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Researcher intuition contrasted with PHRAPL\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257784/1257784_10234439_1493294433857_TrianglePlot_arrows--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Researcher intuition contrasted with PHRAPL\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Analytical models of three varieties are represented at the vertices of the triangle.
