This research asks: what factors account for wealth accumulation patterns for Chinese immigrants, and how can these patterns inform understanding of immigrant adaptation? Chinese immigrants and their descendants are often discussed in terms of their high median levels of achievement, but Chinese Americans vary considerably on education, income, occupation, and labor market mobility. For example, although their median income is high, Chinese Americans are more likely than white natives to live in poverty. Given their size and within-group heterogeneity, this case provides an occasion to study the factors that enhance or impede immigrant adaptation in general. This study will contribute to the immigration literature by providing a detailed within-group study of this important group and by focusing on their wealth (or net worth) accumulation, an important but understudied measure of adaptation. The project has three specific objectives. First, it will provide a detailed portrait of wealth for Chinese immigrants and their children. It will describe wealth ownership for households at all points in the wealth distribution, comparing Chinese Americans with other Americans, other recent immigrants and descendants of immigrants, and other Asians. Second, it will identify unique wealth accumulation trajectories for Chinese immigrants and their American-born children to distinguish patterns of immigrant adaptation. Third, it will assess the degree to which entrepreneurship contributes to wealth accumulation for Chinese immigrants and their children by using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to construct a portrait of Chinese business networks in Southern California.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis research will contribute to research in many academic disciplines including immigration studies, the sociology of race/ethnicity, Chinese American studies, entrepreneurship, stratification and inequality, and economic sociology. This research has the potential to shed new light on an important and growing segment of U.S. society and to broaden understanding of immigration and adaptation processes and pathways more generally. The research is also likely to have important broader social impacts. This proposed research has the potential to inform discussions on immigration, wealth ownership, and inequality. The investigators anticipate disseminating the findings widely, including to non-academics, through publications in non-academic journals, op-ed pieces, and press releases. In addition, the investigators will involve graduate students in all aspects of the research and will draw on the work in their graduate and undergraduate courses on social stratification, immigration, and economic sociology.",

We investigate patterns of wealth accumulation among new immigrant groups, how wealth varies by immigrant-entry status, national origin, tenure in the U.S., and cross-border ties, and how these factors affect business ownership in the U.S. Our results reveal grave disparities in wealth between today?s new immigrants. Chinese immigrants have significantly higher net worth than Latino immigrants and native blacks, reflecting selection on education and income status. However, delving within the Chinese immigrant population, we find important differences in wealth owenership by national origin. Immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwain have higher levels of wealth compared to immigrants from Mainland China due to their hyperselection and economic advantages stemming from home country development. These findings provide important details about the role that within-group heterogeneity among Chinese immigrants may have for their adaptation and long-term class status stability and, thus, answer a growing call from immigration scholars to look more closely at differences within national-origin groups. While there is heterogeneity in wealth among Chinese immigrants, we find a pattern of accelerated economic adaptation, especially for those from HK-T, where wealth exceeds that of native-born whites and blacks, and nearly all other immigrant groups. \n\nDelving further within the Chinese-origin population, we investigate how family wealth, transnational connections, human capital, and educational resources, influence access to capital and entrepreneurial pathways among the Chinese-American first and second generations. We find differences within and between the first and second generation.
