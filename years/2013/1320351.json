 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at quantifying a general network's inner potential\r\nfor supporting various forms of security by achieving secret common\r\nrandomness between pairs or groups of its nodes.  Statistical and\r\ncomputational secrecy measures are being considered against a general\r\npassive adversary. Common-randomness-achieving protocols are classified\r\ninto two groups: culture-building and crowd-shielding. The former achieves\r\ncommon randomness between nodes situated in close proximity of each other,\r\nfrom correlated observations of specific (natural or induced) network\r\nphenomena. The latter ties together the security of multiple communication\r\nlinks, to the point where an adversary can no longer isolate and attack\r\na single link without attacking the group as a whole. The broad range of\r\ninvestigated protocols cover multiple topics, from multipath diversity\r\nto network tomography, from secure network coding to protocol coding,\r\nand from anonymous routing to the spread of epidemics.  The protocols\r\nharvest network randomness from diverse sources like ciphertext blocks\r\noriginating at various terminals, contention protocols (delay randomness)\r\nor network topology (in highly-dynamic, or ad-hoc networks).\r\n\r\nCommunication networks are naturally dynamic, inherently redundant,\r\nand largely unpredictable. While the former two features have long\r\nbeen recognized as a valuable resource for integrity, efficiency\r\nand confidentiality, network unpredictability is often regarded as an\r\nincommodity. This project shows how network randomness can be harvested,\r\nand, together with diversity, exploited to enhance communication\r\nsecurity. In doing so, it develops a more  profound understanding about\r\nthe statistical nature of networks, which can be applied to a broad range\r\nof information-assurance objectives.  The technical approaches and the\r\ngeneral philosophy developed in this project, and disseminated through\r\nconferences and seminars, have the potential to inspire an abundance of\r\nrelated research. The project will directly impact dozens of students\r\nthrough Senior Design projects, a research-and-open-project approach to\r\ncurriculum development, and three new graduate courses containing related\r\ntopics. The PIs are actively involved in programs aimed at increasing\r\nthe involvement of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with\r\ndisabilities in engineering and computing sciences.",
