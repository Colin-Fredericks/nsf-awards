 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the major phenomena on Earth are ice ages and volcanic eruptions.  This research addresses the question how these two seemingly unrelated aspects of our planet may influence one another.  One causal link between the two is the pressure exerted by ice and the oceans on Earth's interior.  Volcanism is sensitive to such changes in pressure.  A second causal link occurs because volcanoes are the ultimate source of natural CO2 delivered to the atmosphere, and CO2 has a marked influence on climate.  During an ice age cycle, vast quantities of water are transferred between continents and oceans, eliminating thick ice sheets and changing sea level.  Melting ice uncorks volcanoes, leading to a pulse of much more active continental volcanism for several thousand years.  Glacially induced sea level change should influence how much Earth's interior melts beneath ocean ridges.  As sea level rises and falls the amount of melt delivered to make the ocean crust should vary by about ten percent, leading to changes in the thickness of the ocean crust and the depth of the sea floor.  This could be the explanation for the undulating topography of the sea floor known as abyssal hills.  The changes in volcanism at ocean ridges could also lead to changes in hydrothermal activity that would influence deep sea ecosystems and affect geochemical budgets of the oceans.  The large volcanic pulse following de-glaciation could add large amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to the rapid warming that occurs at the end of ice ages.  Ultimately, a better understanding of the influence of volcanic CO2 emissions on climate could provide an important context for understanding the significance of human CO2 emissions. \r\n      \r\nTo test these potential relationships, we combine novel new observations with quantitative modeling.  High resolution maps of the sea floor will provide the bathymetric data to test whether abyssal hills vary with climate cycles.  New sediment cores near ocean ridges will reveal whether hydrothermal activity also varies with glacial cycles, and how much it varies.  Sampling and analysis of the volcanic rocks of the sea floor will show how melting of Earth's interior varies over time.  The sea-going work will take place on two cruises, one on a U.S. oceanographic vessel and the other in collaboration with German investigators.  On land, we will collaborate with leading volcanologists from the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the volcanic signal of Cascades volcanoes over recent glacial cycles.  Newly measured ages will constrain the timing of the volcanic response to glaciation.  Geochemical analyses will constraint how volcanism responds to glacial changes, and how much CO2 emissions may vary.  Modeling work will investigate exactly how changes in ice sheets and sea level cause pressure changes beneath volcanic regions on land and undersea, and generate quantitative models of melting of Earth's interior and how it responds to sea level change.  The final aim is an integrated model that links volcanism, CO2 and climate and tests how they may interact with one another over time periods of many glacial cycles.\r\n     \r\nIn essence, we are exploring the coupling between Earth's interior and Earth's climate, perhaps discovering that even the fabric of the ocean floor may be responding to climate change ultimately caused by variations in the amount of solar energy our planet receives, and that glacial cycles are influenced by the pulse of the solid Earth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEarth has repeatedly transitioned from ice ages to inter-glacials, when ice retreats and the climate warms.  Human civilization has flourished in the most recent interglacial, following the last ice age extreme ~20,000 years ago.  These ice age cycles are complex, but have happened about once every hundred thousand years for the past million years.\n \n An underlying cause of the ice age cycles is changes in the amount of summer sunlight received in the northern hemisphere due to periodic variations in Earth's orbit, but these effects are amplified globally by changes in the CO2 content of the atmosphere.  CO2 during glacial periods is about 90 ppm lower than during inter-glacials, cooling temperatures and supporting the formation of ice sheets.  While the central role for CO2 is well known, the causes of the CO2 variations have been mysterious.\n \n Climate scientists working on the atmosphere and ocean have looked for mechanisms whereby the ocean would take up CO2 during ice ages and release it during inter-glacials, but exactly how and why that would happen has not been clear.  The ultimate source of CO2 is volcanism from Earth's interior (Figure 1, the volcano image).  Earth?s interior contains vastly more CO2 than the ocean and atmosphere combined: might changes in volcanic output be an important factor in understanding glacial cycles?  This question has been little explored, partly because solid earth scientists do not generally work on climate science.\n\n\n \n This project united climate and solid earth scientists to explore possible connections between climate and volcanism, and we found that they are extensive. Volcanism is influenced by changes in pressure that confine volcanoes. On land, glaciers cover many volcanoes, inhibiting volcanism even as they erode the volcanic edifice. When the ice melts, global volcanism can increase for a few thousand years by a factor of three to five, pumping extra CO2 into the atmosphere.  This leads to a positive feedback that contributes to rapid climate warming as an ice age ends and an interglacial begins.\n \n Most of Earth's volcanism, however, occurs under the ocean along a global system of ocean ridges.  As ice sheets form and melt, sea level rises and falls by about 100 meters, changing the ocean's downward pressure on the undersea volcanoes.  We carried out a cruise to the Juan de Fuca ocean ridge to determine whether there were changes in volcanism that corresponded with glacial cycles.  We found that as sea level varied, volcanoes along the ridges fluctuated in their output by about twenty percent.  This leads to a new hypothesis for the most common topographic feature on Earth--abyssal hills (Figure 2 sea floor bathymetry) which are long linear quasi-periodic features that define the fabric of the sea floor.\n\n \n\n Both global analyses of sea floor topography and detailed study of individual regions support this surprising new hypothesis, that changes in seasonal sunlight at the surface can end up causing extensive changes in sea floor topography, so that the record of Earth?s orbit is expressed in the hills and valleys of the ocean floor.\n \n Perhaps the most fascinating features of ocean ridge volcanoes are the ?hydrothermal vents?, extremely hot springs that serve as oases for deep sea biological communities (Figure 3, hydrothermal vent illustration), and also form very rich ore deposits.  In addition to providing a deep-sea ecosystem, these vents are also the source of important chemicals such as iron to the oceans.  Hydrothermal input of iron is surprisingly important because it is a limiting nutrient for the oceanic biosphere.  The record of hydrothermal activity is contained in sediments that accumulate at the bottom of the ocean. By taking cores of sediments around the ocean ridge, we discovered that hydrothermal activity also varies with glacial cycles. The variations in volcanism change the balance between heat output and rock faulting, and this controls how hot and extensive the vents are.\n\n\n The cores we recovered also led to a serendipitous discovery.  In the bottom meter of the cores, very fresh fragments of volcanic lava were preserved (Figure 4a, core being recoverd from ship 4b glass fragments).  These fragments were created by volcanic eruptions that explosively send them up into the water column where they spread before settling down into the sediment below.  Over thousands of years, the sediment gradually thickened, and the preserved lava fragments reveal how the chemical composition and form of volcanism changed over time.  How volcanism varies with time has been one of the hardest problems to crack at ocean ridges, and sediment cores now hold the promise of providing records of hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, opening up a whole new dimension of study of ocean ridge systems.\n \n\n\n \n Through interdisciplinary cooperation, we discovered linkages between the solid earth and glacial cycles, establishing new connections, developing new hypotheses, and showing anew the amazing inter-connectedness of the Earth system.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles H Langmuir"
