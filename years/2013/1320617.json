 "awd_abstract_narration": "Big data leads to big challenges, not only in the volume of data but also in its dynamics and variety. Multiple descriptions about the same set of objects or events from different sources unavoidably lead to data or information inconsistency. Then, among conflicting pieces of data or information, it is crucial to tell which data source is reliable or which piece of information is correct. Accurate information is referred to as the truth and the chance of a source providing accurate information is denoted as source reliability or trustworthiness. The objective of this project is to detect truths without supervision, by integrating source reliability estimation and truth finding. A unified framework is developed to model complex trustworthiness factors, heterogeneous data types, incremental and parallel computation, and source and data dependencies so that truth and trustworthiness can be inferred from multiple conflicting sources of heterogeneous, disparate, correlated, gigantic, scattered, and streaming data.\r\n\r\nThis project makes tangible contributions to data integration, information understanding and decision making, and benefits many applications where critical decisions have to be made based on the correct information extracted from diverse sources. Research results of this project are integrated into course materials and projects, and into training students and new generation researchers, especially female and minority students.

CoType: Joint Extraction of Typed Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases (Figure 3)</strong></p>\n<p>We investigate joint extraction of typed entities and relations with<strong> </strong>labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge bases (i.e., distant supervision).<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>As our algorithm for type labeling via distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy<strong> </strong>training data poses unique challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent<strong> </strong>framework, COTYPE, that runs a data-driven text segmentation<strong> </strong>algorithm to extract entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation<strong> </strong>mentions, text features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity<strong> </strong>and relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are<strong> </strong>close will also have similar representations. COTYPE, then using these learned<strong> </strong>embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. &nbsp;We formulate a joint<strong> </strong>optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases,<strong> </strong>adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and introducing an<strong> </strong>object \"translation\" function to capture the cross-constraints of entities and relations<strong> </strong>on each other. &nbsp;Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness<strong> </strong>of COTYPE across different domains (e.g., news, biomedical), with an average of<strong> </strong>25% improvement in F1 score compared to the next best method.

TruePIE learns arity-constraints from data distribution of a seed pattern set and applies the constraints to tuples extracted from numerous pattern candidates of good content quality, which enables capturing conflicts, modeling the reliability of textual patterns, and finding true facts. We iteratively conduct the truth finding and pattern reliability modeling to mutually enhance each other.
