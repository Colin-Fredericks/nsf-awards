 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a \"rectenna\" device that simultaneously collects and rectifies solar radiation from infrared to visible. The approach is to use selective atomic layer deposition, a process developed by the investigators, which is capable of fabricating arrays of thousands of nanoscopic, geometrically-asymmetric tunnel junctions in a reproducible manner. An integrated program of device fabrication, characterization, and numerical modeling will provide insight into device design aimed at creating larger arrays (to harness more power), and smaller junction gaps (to reach the visible spectrum).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nUntil the advent of selective atomic layer deposition, developed by the present team of researchers, it has not been possible to fabricate practical and reproducible rectenna arrays that can harness solar energy from the infrared through the visible. The fabrication, characterization, and modeling of the proposed rectenna arrays will lead to increased understanding of the physical processes underlying these devices, which will add greatly to the fields of solid-state device physics and solar power conversion technology research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe solar power conversion device under development by this collaboration of two universities and an industry subcontractor has the potential to revolutionize green solar power technology by increasing efficiencies, reducing costs, and providing new economic opportunities. A large, diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will acquire extensive research experience and training. The four faculty members and two industry subcontractors have proven experience working with underrepresented groups including, women, minorities, and international colleagues and students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the major challenges to efficient harvesting and conversion of electromagnetic energy into electricity is a lack of broadband devices that can collect and convert electromagnetic energy from the IR through the visible.  To address this major challenge, we fabricated large arrays of nanoantennas using nanofabrication methods.  The arrays consist of pairs of metal dimer nanostructures with nanosized gaps.  By varying the size, shape, nanogap, and material, we characterized the optical properties and determined design criteria that allow arrays of nanoantenna to absorb and scatter light from the visible to the near infrared.  This was accomplished through experimental measurements of optical extinction as well as finite-difference time-domain simulations, which examined the agreement between theory and experiment and provided feedback for design iteration.\n\nIn order to achieve electro-optic devices that couple efficient light harvesting with electronic currents, antenna-coupled diodes with nanogaps near 1 nm are required.  To this end, we investigated a novel approach based on selective-area atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a scalable method to nanofabricate tunnel junctions.  The ALD process selectively adds copper metal to antennas patterned with palladium, which allows precise control of the nanogaps.  We studied how the addition of copper layers modifies the optical resonances of the antennas.  Extracting energy from the plasmonic devices requires that the antennas be connected to an external electrical circuit.  We investigated how adding contacts to plasmonic nanostructures modifies their optical response.  Experiments and computer simulations were used to investigate the difference between arrays of devices that are isolated and those that are electrically connected.  The outcome has lead to an increased understanding of the physics of electro-optic plasmonic nanostructures, as well as nanofabrication methods to realize new types of nanodevices.  Plasmonic nanostructures are promising for new types of energy conversion devices that may enable a new generation of green technologies.\n\nThe project also provided transformative educational opportunities for two graduate students and 15 undergraduates, and enabled the professional development of three faculty at Penn State Altoona and the University of Connecticut.  The work allowed students and faculty to be immersed in an outstanding research environment where students learned to become scientists by participating directly in all aspects of the research program, from experiment design to dissemination of results with oral and poster presentations at regional and national meetings.  The research project also supported technology transfer through collaboration between two universities and a small startup company. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian G Willis"
