 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project connects a core curriculum science course taught in the Earth and Environmental Science department entitled, Science for Future Legislators, with the public through the growing of hydroponic food, air quality data collection using data eggs, and the use of touch foil technologies. Partnering with local businesses and libraries, the project team places touch foils on windows to engage the general public in understanding air quality data and the impact of land cover use and changes in air quality.  A touch foil is a thin film that can be placed on any glass surface, for example a storefront window, which transforms that window into a large interactive touch surface (in essence transforming the window in a giant iPad). Using this guerilla science approach affords the general public the opportunity to learn about science in places where they would not expect to see science. The goal is to provide access to scientific data and analyses that are understandable and of interest to the general public in a way that does not require a visit to a museum or similar institution but in a place where the public takes a regular walk, visits, or spends their time. The project also engages non-science majors in growing produce hydroponically and learning how to conduct scientific research to investigate processes that maximize production.  The produce is sold at a local market to help sustain the program and to help the community have access to fresh, healthy, and local food.",
