Keith Gilless, University of California-Berkeley\r\n1242957\r\nRichard Smith, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\n\r\n     One of the most important questions in climate science is how extreme weather changes as a result of natural and anthropogenic forcings.  At this project's core is a goal to address three areas that are critical to understanding extreme events, but whose methods are not yet developed enough to answer impact-relevant questions.  First, the investigators advance and develop multivariate statistical methods that can describe and model extreme events that arise from a combination of meteorological factors that may or may not individually be extreme.  Second, the investigators advance spatial downscaling methods to be applicable to studying extreme phenomena that occur at spatial scales not resolved by climate models.  Third, the investigators put the study of detection of changes in extremes and attribution of extreme events on a solid statistical foundation, and apply the spatial and multivariate techniques to this area.  The participants collaborate with social scientists in incorporating the improved methodology into models that analyze the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production and the forestry sector for specific regions of the US.  They also develop risk assessment measures that take into account possible increases in the frequency of extreme weather events. \r\n\r\n     Extreme weather can have profound consequences for the well-being of individuals, societies, and natural systems.  This project studies several aspects of weather extremes and how the nature of extreme events is likely to change under an altered climate.  The project develops probability-based measures of risk that take account of the fact that impacts of extreme weather events cannot be predicted with certainty.  Another feature of the project is that high-impact events often arise from a combination of extreme weather conditions.  For example, wildfires may arise from a combination of heat, wind, and lack of moisture; we therefore need methods of analysis that take into account multiple meteorological variables.  Most of the methods being developed rely on large computer programs known as climate models to project future climatic events.  However, climate models often work on time and space scales that are much larger than the high-impact events we are interested in; therefore, data from climate models must be translated to the scales of interest.  The specific focus on extreme events is different from most current research using climate models for the detection and attribution of climate change.  Detecting changes in extreme behavior is essential for risk assessment, as risk-related quantities such as the 100-year flood, fire, burning, and heat indexes are estimated based on data that may no longer be relevant if extreme behavior has changed.  The determination of the impact of such changes at a broad range of socio-economic levels is needed to determine appropriate societal responses to extreme weather events associated with climate change.  In addition to university-based investigators, the project includes Michael Wehner and collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. who are an intrinsic part of the team.  University-based investigators are funded by NSF while the Department of Energy supports LBNL investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals laid out for this project were to advance statistical methods for extremes which could be applied to better understand high-impact weather events.  In particular, we aimed to advance methods for multivariate extremes, or extremes that exhibit dependence as in the spatial setting.  In terms of intellectual merit, univariate extremes methods have become commonplace in atmospheric science studies, but multivariate and spatial studies remain largely inaccessible due to a lack of statistical methods, or due to the methods? difficulty in use.  Events such as wildfires whose risk increases with temperature, wind speed, and dry conditions have been simplistically modeled because risk arises from multiple factors.  Particular challenges were to develop methods for high dimensional extremes, which were nearly non-existent, and to develop spatial extremes models which could be fit to large data sets.  In terms of broader impacts, these statistical tools will aid in understanding risk associated with high-impact extreme weather events, but further to understand these events? contributing factors.  As high-impact extreme events are not limited to weather, it is likely that advances made here could be translated to other disciplines such as finance, insurance, and engineering.\n\n \n\nIt is likely that the largest statistical contribution coming out of this project is the development of transformed linear operations for extremes.  Linear methods are ubiquitous in ?traditional? statistics; time series models, linear prediction, spatial models, and principal component analysis (PCA) are just a few examples.  Via transformed linear operations, we develop linear methods which focus attention on the tail of the distribution, rather than its center.\n\n \n\nOur first application of these transformed linear operations was to develop PCA analysis for extremes. The purpose of such an analysis is to perform dimension reduction for high-dimensional data:  identifying modes of important large scale behavior and focusing attention on these modes.   Figures 1 &amp; 2 show the 2nd-largest mode and its time series from a precipitation study of hurricane season at over 1100 US weather stations.  We found that this mode, which has a strong signal along the US East Coast, has a very strong relationship with the El-Nino Southern Oscillation.\n\n \n\nAnother application of transformed linear operations was to develop an extremes analogue to a spatial autoregressive model, a familiar spatial model for non extreme analysis.  We successfully fit this model to data from hundreds of locations, and we see no reason that this model could not be fit to thousands or tens-of-thousands of locations.\n\n \n\nOutside of this project?s transformed linear operations work, other extremes methods were developed.  We developed a method for visualizing multivariate return levels which help researchers to understand the joint behavior of different variables which in combination lead to extreme events.  We applied this method to dryness and windspeed data in a study of wildfire conditions and also to temperature and humidity data in a study of heat-induced human health effects.  Figure 3 shows the method applied to the wildfire data, note that the highest isoline is beyond the range of the data.\n\n \n\nOther work produced as part of this project provided new models for spatial extremes.  In one project, a spatial extremes model was developed to investigate projected temperature-induced changes in insect damaged forests.  Another developed a novel model for spatial dependence in the asymptotically independent setting, a particularly difficult type of extremal dependence to model.  Early work in the project was motivated by the 2013 Colorado floods, which provided us an opportunity to investigate how a large event can influence return level estimates.  A study of extreme precipitation as produced by the latest suite of climate models produced estimates of projected changes in return levels due to climate change.\n\n \n\nIn terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts, capabilities to model and investigate multivariate extreme behavior were advanced on multiple fronts.  In particular, our development of tools to model and explore high dimensional extremes we expect to be particularly useful both in the atmospheric sciences and beyond.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Cooley"
