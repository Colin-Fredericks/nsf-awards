Graduate students will have an opportunity to present their research results and to interact with experts from academia, government agencies, and industry across the United States and from abroad.  The \"off-the-record\" format presentation and discussion led by the topic experts also offers the exchange of the emerging ideas of the field.  The proposed funding is to provide support for registration for both GRS and GRC to student presenters.",

The importance of industrialization of the combustion process has also become evident. All of these topics have been the subjects of thorough discussion at biennial international symposiums.  In view of the increasing role of combustion in achieving efficiency, this symposium brings researchers from across the World to present and discuss relevant concepts and technologies. The symposium provides numerous opportunities for networking among the participants, thus promoting the generation of novel experimental and modeling ideas, striking of new collaborations, and advancement of innovative combustion c..."
