 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award has been funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A Program of the Division of Chemistry. It will support the work of Prof. Thomas D. Varberg and his undergraduate student researchers at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota as they record and analyze the electronic spectra of gas-phase free radicals that contain a transition metal atom. These molecules will be studied using laser-excitation spectroscopy in the visible region, with both pulsed and continuous-wave lasers. Spectral analyses will yield accurate values for the principal molecular constants, including the vibrational, rotational, fine, and hyperfine structures. Such analyses will characterize in some detail the nature of each molecule's electronic states and chemical bonding, as well as provide accurate transition frequencies that are of use to scientists in other fields. The molecules targeted for study include diatomic molecules such as gold sulfide, tantalum hydride, tantalum oxide and hafnium fluoride, and linear polyatomic molecules such as zinc acetylide and copper acetylide.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding the structure, bonding and spectroscopy of molecules that contain a transition metal is important for several reasons. For example, chemists have learned how to make small clusters of gold atoms known as colloids and then react these colloids with long-chain organic molecules that terminate in a sulfur atom. The resulting gold nanoparticles are possible building blocks for devices to be used for data storage, ultrafast switching and quantum electronics. This NSF award will support fundamental measurements on the diatomic molecule gold sulfide as a study of the simplest form of the gold-sulfur bond, which lies at the heart of the more complex nanoparticle structures. Furthermore, many industrially useful chemical reactions of organic compounds utilize transition metals to catalyze, or speed up, the formation of the desired product. In these catalyzed reactions, a metal-carbon bond is formed and then later broken in transforming the system from reactant to product. Experiments supported by this NSF award will study some of the simplest metal-carbon bonds found in nature, the results of which will help chemists understand such bonding in larger systems. All of these studies will be carried out by Macalester College undergraduate students, which will introduce these young scientists to modern research in physical chemistry and prepare them for graduate training in chemistry, chemical physics, and engineering.",

We worked on three different molecules during the course of this grant: tantalum oxide (TaO), tantalum hydride (TaH), and gold sulfide (AuS), with the majority of our time focused on gold sulfide. We investigated the gas-phase electronic spectra of these molecules using laser-excitation spectroscopy in the visible and near infrared regions, typically at sub-Doppler resolution obtained by the use of intermodulated fluorescence spectroscopy. In the first stage of the analysis, we determined the quantum number labels for each of the many transitions we observed in our spectra. Following this work, we were able to accomplish several specific goals, including: (1) determining accurate values of the significant molecular constants by fitting para&shy;meter&shy;ized equations (representing the effective Hamiltonian) to the measured transitions, (2) characterizing the nature of the electronic states involved in the transition(s) using the analyzed hyperfine structure arising from Ta, Au and/or H nuclei, and (3) determining accurate transition frequencies that are of use to scientists in other fields. We show examples of our spectra in the accompanying two figures. The first figure displays a portion of the Doppler-limited spectrum of the a<sup>4</sup>&Sigma;<sup>-</sup>&ndash;X<sup>2</sup>&Pi;<sub>3/2</sub> (0,0) band of AuS. The second figure displays a portion of the same band recorded under sub-Doppler conditions. Here the hyperfine splitting due to the <sup>197</sup>Au (<em>I</em> = 3/2) nucleus is clearly visible. The results of our work on TaO, TaH and AuS have now been published in the physical chemistry literature via three different publications. We expect to publish two more papers on the spectrum of AuS.</p>\n<p>A substantial and broader impact of this work supported by NSF was to prepare Macalester chemistry majors for graduate work in physical chemistry, chemical physics and closely related fields.<strong> </strong>A total of seven different undergraduate students worked on these projects. The skills these students acquired included the use of modern laser technology, methods of signal processing, computer interfacing of instrumentation and lasers, numerical data analysis, use of the typical instruments found in a modern machine shop, and the professional presentation of research results, all of which are skills that are highly useful in a wide variety of scientific settings. Six of these students have now graduated from Macalester College. Of these six students, five entered Ph.D. programs in chemistry, with another student planning on applying to graduate school this coming year. The seventh student is still currently in my research group.
