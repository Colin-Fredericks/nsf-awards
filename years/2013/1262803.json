 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout the Arctic, indigenous people are faced with difficult choices between the cash benefits of industrialization versus potential degradation of subsistence hunting.  Subsistence hunting often provides a large fraction of foods, and may be more reliable in the long term than a cash economy based on nonrenewable resources.  Subsistence hunting for certain species may also have cultural significance that far exceeds their dietary contribution.  On the Chukchi Sea coast, pipelines connecting offshore oil wells to onshore terminals must be built across a nearshore corridor used by most marine birds and mammals that migrate to the western North American Arctic. These animals are hunted for subsistence by local Natives.  During spring, these animals travel through a zone of open water that forms between landfast ice and moving pack ice.  If an oil pipeline were ruptured by spring ice scour in this shallow zone, oil could probably not be removed from open water within broken ice during migration.  Such an event could not only restrict the extent of viable habitat, but also eliminate local hunting areas.  Thus, key habitats that are usually accessible to hunting should be avoided in pipeline placement.  In this research, we will model habitat requirements and map viable prey densities for a formerly hunted but now threatened species (Spectacled Eider, SPEI) and a commonly hunted species (King Eider, KIEI) in the Chukchi nearshore zone, and determine long-term variability in the eiders? access to those areas through the ice.  We will refine these maps with traditional ecological knowledge on conditions and areas where hunting for KIEI typically occurs.  We will then estimate probabilities that different eider feeding areas that are accessible through the ice and conducive to hunting would be eliminated during migration by oil spills from pipelines built along four alternative routes.  We will use this information to inform structured decision-making workshops we will hold in the Native community.  These workshops will help create a local vision for sustainability, in terms of potential risks of different pipeline routes to subsistence and cultural values of eiders, relative to cash benefits of local construction projects.\r\n\r\nLocal villagers will be involved in creating and shaping the data set, and will be the main participants in structured decision-making workshops.  We will integrate our work with outreach and education programs conducted in these villages by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Our project will yield important information for future evaluations and decision-making by Endangered Species and Migratory Bird Management Offices.  Our modern scientific and traditional ecological data, and facilitation of community consensus-building, will expedite later impact assessments by BOEM and other agencies as oilfield development proceeds.  On a hemispheric scale, the approach we develop will serve as a prototype applicable to the many such situations developing across the Arctic.",

We did this through a series of workshops in Wainwright, coupled with questionnaires and interviews to gather relevant information. While our project was underway, oil and gas drilling offshore from Wainwright came to an abrupt end (for the time being at least). This meant that the issues we had planned to discuss were suddenly much less pressing. In discussion with our local partners, we decided to re-focus on safety during hunting and on employment opportunities for youth. The structured decision support approach was useful in thinking through what local participants were concerned about and what options they had to address those concerns. Specifically, taking a systematic approach to the questions led participants to realize that some concerns were comparatively minor, a conclusion that was not evident when we were initially listing the factors that threaten hunting or the species being hunted. We concluded, along with our local partners, that the structured decision support approach was a useful tool for complicated questions. It helps identify what is really at issue, what information we have and what information we need, and what criteria are appropriate for evaluating potential actions. It is important to note that the kinds of complicated questions we were addressing lead to answers that are not obvious to anyone. In other words, it is not sufficient simply to ask local residents what they want or how some aspect of the community functions. Without the chance to think through the question more thoroughly and carefully, off-the-cuff answers are unlikely to offer much insight or have much chance of a successful outcome. At the community&rsquo;s request, we produced a 20-page booklet reporting our results in plain language, which was distributed to community residents.
