 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations Program in the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, the Developmental Systems Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Biological and Computing Shared Principles working group.  \r\n\r\nEvery cell contains an extremely complex control system for functions essential for survival and reproduction of the organism.  Identification of the design principles embodied in this poorly understood core regulatory circuitry of the cell is the focus of this project.  In many ways, this cellular control system resembles the electronic systems that humans design, although it uses biochemical and genetic reactions instead of transistors as its underlying technology. Over many decades, electrical engineers have learned design principles that enable the design of robust, reliable systems.  This project investigates whether cellular control circuitry makes use of these same principles, and whether there are new principles that can be learned from cells. This is addressed by analysis of the essential logic controlling the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Caulobacter control circuitry resembles asynchronous digital circuits, a type of digital design that does not use a global clock signal to coordinate the system.  The design of reliable asynchronous circuits is a difficult engineering challenge, and many interesting methods for designing and analyzing these circuits have been developed.   \r\n\r\nThis project maps out the essential control circuitry, which regulates the processes that are vital to cell viability, using a combination of laboratory and computational methods.  The research integrates results from several types of high-throughput data, including ribosome profiling, RNA-seq data at various points in the cell cycle, and ChIP-seq, and combines that with computational DNA binding motif search. A hybrid continuous and discrete mathematical model will be developed for the essential cell regulatory system, and a homologous asynchronous digital circuit will be constructed and analyzed using model checking software.  The circuit structure and model checking results are used to map existing asynchronous circuit design concepts to the biological domain, and to identify new circuit design methods that may have been selected by evolution that lead to the extreme robustness displayed by living cells.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Outcomes\nThis was an interdisciplinary project with investigators from biology, computer science, and electrical engineering. The goal was to deepen understanding of the biochemical and genetic regulatory network that controls the cell cycle of the model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Caulobacter is of particular interest because it divides asymmetrically to produce two differentiated daughter cells: a \"swarmer\" cell with a flagellum that which provides motility and a \"stalked\" cell which has a multifunctional stalk appendage. Only the stalk cell type is competent to initiate chromosome replication and cell division. After a short period of motility, the swarmer ejects its flagellum, differentiates into the stalked cell type, and then initiates another cycle of cell duplication and division. Over the past 40 years, the molecular and genetic mechanisms of the complex Caulobacter cell cycle have been intensively studied so that now Caulobacter is the best understood model at the molecular level of how cells accomplish asymmetric division.  This is a profoundly important current problem in the biological sciences and medicine.\nIn this project, we focused on understanding essential regulatory genes, that is the subset of genes that are essential for Caulobacter viability. Regulatory genes encode proteins that control the synthesis of other proteins, some of which can also have a regulatory function.\nIntellectual merit\nThe project produced several important insights into Caulobacter cell which are described in publications by the team.  The first paper1 identifies cell cycle-regulated genes and characterizes details of their regulation with unprecedented accuracy. The paper offers new insights into how some genes are subject to combinatorial control by multiple regulatory mechanisms simultaneously.  This enables the cell to adjust the rate of progression of the cell cycle in response to conditions in the environment or internal to the cell.\nA second paper2 provides a detailed characterization of cell cycle-dependent regulation of translation (the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in messenger RNAs), a topic that has previously not been investigated in bacteria. We showed that polar-located proteins are synthesized in a narrow time window just when needed for insertion at the proper pole and that cell cycle-dependent translation is controlled by the same cyclical biochemical circuit that controls gene transcription. This is an important advance in our standing of the bacterial cell cycle control system.\nOne of the goals of the project was to understand the control of the cell cycle as an \"asynchronous circuit\" &ndash; a digital circuit with no central clock.  This project has led us to a deeper investigation of methods for designing fault-tolerant asynchronous circuits &ndash; circuits that continue to function despite limited internal faults, such as transient changes that are not supposed to occur or signals that don?t change when they are supposed to (\"stuck-at faults\").
