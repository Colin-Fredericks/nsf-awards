 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jonathan Pober is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Washington.  This project involves observations to understand the formation of the first galaxies in the Universe.  This period of cosmic history, called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), occurred when emission from the first galaxies fed back into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and ionized it.  The Fellow is a developer of the NSF-funded Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), an experiment to detect a radio signal from the EoR.  Ultimately, measurements of 21cm radio emission from both the EoR and other epochs offer a unique, 3-dimensional cosmic probe with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cosmology as the cosmic microwave background has done in the past two decades.\r\n\r\nExperiments like PAPER have been limited so far by the intrinsic faintness of the cosmological 21cm signal, and the presence of significantly brighter astrophysical foreground emission.  This project will benefit from recent developments in infrastructure and data analysis to overcome these obstacles, and it may offer the first meaningful constraints on the nature of the galaxies responsible for reionization to come from observations of the 21cm line.  Because the first generation of results from PAPER will be low signal-to-noise, the Fellow will support his principal analysis with a campaign to investigate systematic effects in 21cm EoR experiments to maximize the scientific impact of these measurements.  His collaboration with sponsoring scientist Miguel Morales at the University of Washington will provide access to data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), another array targeting a detection of the EoR signal. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will take over the development of the Gamma-ray Burst All-Sky Spectrometer Experiment (GASE), a unique resource for the educational component of this program.  GASE is an interferometer designed to detect low-frequency (30 MHz) radio emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB).  GASE is currently being commissioned by a team of community college transfer students, recruited and trained as part of an NSF CAREER award (AST-0847753).  These students begin working on GASE prior to transferring, and as a result, they develop a network of support and mentoring relationships to help fight against \"transfer shock\" and increase their retention rate.  The fellow will take over direction of the GASE project and be the principal supervisor for these students.  He will also lead them to develop the GASE system, including a new correlator to enable continuous observations.  The fellow's ultimate vision for the project is for GASE to be deployable at multiple institutions and for it to be a hands-on, education-focused interferometer that until recently was beyond the reach of most undergraduate physics and astronomy departments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of this project were activities with significant intellectual merit for the field of cosmology and broader impact on the STEM educated community.\n\nThe two main goals of intellectual merit were to produce improved measurements of the cosmological hydrogen power spectrum with the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and to use a cross-comparison between PAPER and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to better understand the systematics effecting these measurements.  This first goal was demonstrably achieved, with several publications, each of which were the best limits at the time of publications.  The latest limit from the 64 element PAPER array is still the best limit on the signal to date.  Under this project, we also published a cosmological interpretation of this limit, which represents the first significant cosmological information to come from interferometric 21 cm experiments: a limit on the temperature of the intergalactic medium approximately 600 million years after the Big Bang.\n\nTowards the second goal of cross comparison studies, we conducted several significant studies.  We provided new evidence for the subtle yet pernicious effects of foreground emission on these experiments, and using this new understanding, produced several forecasts for how these newly discovered systematics will affect the science return of future experiments in the field.\n\nThe broader impacts of this project were in developing a pedagogical radio astronomy array and by building an undergraduate community college transfer program centered on summer research with the array.  This program was quite successful, with all six students now having graduated or on track to graduate.  Work was also done to upgrade the array, increasing its simplicity and pedagogical value, while also utilizing readily available components to enable future deployments at other universities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Pober"
