 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Developing New Science and Technology for Subglacial Studies of the Whillans Ice Plain and West Antarctic Ice Sheet is supported by the Antarctic Integrated System Science (AISS) program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of the Division of Polar Programs within the Geosciences Directorate of the National Sciences Foundation (NSF).  The funds will support the design, construction, and deployment of a roving hot water drill and basal ice coring equipment to be deployed in conjunction with the WISSARD (Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access and Research Drilling) project during the 2013/2014 field season. The roving hot water drill will be deployed at up to two locations in each of two sites: in the vicinity of Subglacial Lake Whillans, and at the grounding line where the drainage from Subglacial Lake Whillans empties into the sub-ice shelf cavity. The ice coring equipment will only be used at the grounding line location. All locations are at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, connected to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The new equipment will be used to augment two on-going projects occurring in the Whillans Ice Stream area, WISSARD, that focuses on understanding the biology, geochemistry, paleogeology, and hydrological/glaciological interactions of the Whillans Subglacial system, and a second project focused on the micro-earthquakes associated with the sticky spots found in the Whillans area.  The basal ice corer will add significant data to the WISSARD project, and the roving drill will provide access holes to insert within glacial seismometers that will allow a much better understanding of the micro-earthquakes. The within glacial seismometers will build on the collection of surface seismic data from 2012-13 that are characterized by repeated high frequency events interpreted as basal earthquakes. These earthquake events were not detectable at stations only 20 km away, so obtaining a better understanding of these physical mechanisms will be very useful for understanding basal ice motion and friction.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  In addition to the contributions to the understanding of ice dynamics mentioned above, future availability of a roving hot water drill system and related coring capabilities will result in increased research opportunities for researchers from a range of disciplines interested in the interface between the base of the ice sheets and the underlying substrate. The project will also support the development of the US's technical expertise in hot water drilling. Finally, the project will provide further funding of the public outreach and education started by the WISSARD project.  The WISSARD outreach and education activities have been exceptional to date, and it is expected that additional activities enabled by this new award will be exceptional as well.",

These systems were used to melt ice-penetrating boreholes through 10&rsquo;s to 100&rsquo;s of meters of ice for a series of science projects designed to explore and cleanly sample the water, sediment and biology of sub-ice environments, as well as to instrument boreholes with sensors to obtain time series measurements of ice movement and temperature. The various projects supported by these drills were located on the Whillans Ice Plain (WhIP), Ross Ice Shelf, and McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The UNL team also refurbished and operated a hot water ice corer that was used to collect ice core samples from the basal ice environment at the grounding zone of the Ross Ice Shelf. During the 2015-2016 austral summer, the UNL-SMO&rsquo;s team traveled to McMurdo Station, Antarctica to inspect, maintain and remove hot water drilling equipment from the ice for further repairs following the successful completion of these projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main WISSARD CHWDS is a 1.2 kW capacity, modular, clean access, hot water drill system that includes the following modules: (1) a Melt Tank (MT), (2) a 3700 gallon capacity Water Supply Tank (WST), (3) a Water Filtration and decontamination Unit (WFU), (4) two Heater-Pump Units (HPU-1, HPU-2), (5) a Hose Reel Unit (HRU), (6) a Command and Control module (C&amp;C), and (7) a Storage Traverse Unit (STU). These modules were mounted on ISO ski kits and transported over 1200 miles from McMurdo Station to Subglacial Lake Whillans and back. Some modules experienced damage while being pulled by US Antarctic Program tractors, but only the heaviest module, the HRU, suffered extensive damage that required it to be removed from the ice for repairs (Figures 1, 2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The UNL Roving HWDS is a relatively lightweight, mobile hot water drill system created from component parts of older, existing hot water drills that have been combined with a new drill hose and hose reel, as well as new control hardware and software to provide access holes into the ocean beneath ice shelves. These modules were mounted on a small number of sleds for transport into the field. The system includes eight small hot water heaters (pressure washer units), three pump units, a melt water tank, a main water tank, a glycol tank, a main hose reel with a 1,000 m-long by 3/4 inch internal diameter (ID) main drill hose having a food-grade inner liner, which is connected to a weighted drill tip and nozzle, a return hose reel with return hose and downhole submersible pump, a manifold for routing the hot and cold sides of the connecting plumbing to/from all of these components, a power generator, assorted hoses, cables and electrical lines, and a drill tower sled with sheaves that guide the hoses from the reels into and out of the keyhole and main borehole in the ice. During the 2015-2016 austral summer season the Roving HWDS modules were removed from two USAP sleds and either stored on the WISSARD Launch and Recovery system (LARS) deck or removed from the ice for further maintenance (see Figures 3-6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hands-on experience gained by the early-career engineers while working with senior driller/engineers with extensive career experience was extremely beneficial for building a shared understanding about the maintenance and operation of the WISSARD CHWDS and the UNL Roving HWDS, which helps to preserve the &ldquo;corporate memory&rdquo; between successive generations of hot water drillers working in Antarctica. The ability to cleanly access subglacial environments, for example, to explore subglacial lakes under the ice sheets and the ice shelf cavities beneath ice shelves surrounding Antarctica, opens up a wide range of possibilities for new discoveries and the involvement of other disciplines of science and engineering, from glaciology to geology, geophysics, oceanography, biology, geochemistry, genomics, ecosystem studies, and many others.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/24/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harwood</p>\n</div>\n<div
