 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being used to convene a workshop of ~40 participants to define end-user needs related to geoscience education within the EarthCube initiative.  The workshop brings together disciplinary faculty in the geosciences, educators experienced in teaching with geoscience data and developing associated curricula, representatives of NSF-sponsored research programs involved with generation of large data sets, as well as technologists, STEM education researchers, and learning scientists.  The workshop is being held at the Scripps Forum (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) during the Spring of 2013.  The workshop seeks to explore both the educational opportunities offered through the cyberinfrastructure capabilities of the EarthCube program and identify the educational needs for preparing undergraduate students and faculty to be the future contributors to the scientific research enabled by EarthCube.  A major goal of this workshop is to establish an initial roadmap for educational activities that should be associated with or enabled by EarthCube.  The workshop will consider the educational and instructional strategies not only to prepare students in undergraduate programs to be technologically-savvy users of EarthCube data and models, but also to build the future scientific capacity to advance Earth systems scientific research.  Consideration will also be given to how EarthCube may serve as a platform for advancing STEM education research.",

An example of the kinds of  insight that emerged:  \"everyone, no matter how senior and experienced  they may be, becomes a novice again when they enter into an  interdisciplinary collaboration.  If EarthCube can make Earth data  accessible to undergraduates, it becomes at the same time accessible to  scholars from all other domains of human knowledge who wish to  collaborate with geoscientists.\"  \n\nBroader Impact:  We laid out a blueprint by which NSF\u00c6s  investment in building cyberinfrastructure and associated governance  structures for scientists working at the frontiers of knowledge can be  re-purposed to help in educating the next generation of scientists and  citizens. Using EarthCube as a resource, the \"data savvy\" college  graduate will be more knowledgeable about the evidentiary basis for  knowledge about the Earth, and will be skilled at using data and models  to answer difficult questions and solve ha..."
