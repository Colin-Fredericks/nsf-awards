 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop a novel wireless surgical camera system to enhance \r\nand improve surgical procedures for single incision laparoscopic surgery. The camera system can \r\nbe inserted into a body cavity via an incision or a natural orifice for the operation instruments, \r\nwhich eliminates the need for dedicated incisions for laparoscopic cameras and the shared use of \r\nan incision for surgical instruments. The key innovation of the insertable camera is the design of \r\na semi-spherical driving unit driven externally by a specially designed magnetic stator with \r\nvarying thickness of tissue insulation. The design addresses the challenges in anchoring and \r\nmanipulating single or multiple camera systems inside body cavities during surgical operations \r\nby elegantly coupling manipulation and navigation functions into the semi-spherical driving unit.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is the technological and theoretical bases for a new class of wireless \r\nlaparoscopic cameras that consist of an in vivo rotor and an ex vivo stator for single incision \r\nlaparoscopic surgery. The innovative design enables precise translational and rotational control \r\nof laparoscopic cameras, and the estimation of critical depth information of the surgical scene \r\nand instruments for hand eye coordination.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are the societal benefits to patients by reducing unnecessary muscle cuts and \r\nscars, blood loss, hospital stay duration, post-operative pain, and recovery time. This project also \r\nprovides education and outreach activities to undergraduate and graduate students by innovative \r\nteaching and project design modules, and demonstration activities at local K-12 schools and \r\nyouth summer camps.",
