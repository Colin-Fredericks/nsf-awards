 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to support the Workshop on Future Research Needs in Advanced Manufacturing from Industrial Prospective; August 11-13, 2013; Arlington, Virginia. This workshop aims to provide a forum for leaders in industry and academia to formulate the long term research goals in the area of manufacturing, particularly innovative manufacturing processes and equipment, and to enhance respective process capabilities while taking into account impacts on industrial ecology, for example, raw materials consumption and environmental impact. A diverse group of individuals from both academia and industry will come together to discuss the future manufacturing challenges and research needs from industrial perspective. Major activities of the workshop include presentations by industrial leaders and NSF program directors, as well as interactions among workshop attendees.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will create a long-term impact on the future research needs and directions. The expected outcome includes outlook to manufacturing research, suggestions of future research directions, and an establishment of a channel for long term dialogue between industrial leaders and academic researchers. Results from this workshop will be disseminated at a public website and to professional societies, and will be presented at manufacturing conferences.",
