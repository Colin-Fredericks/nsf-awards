This\r\nlevel of resolution allows scientists and engineers to investigate cells, organelles, viruses,\r\nand nanoparticles on their relevant length scale. A group of 23 Georgia Tech faculty members\r\nin 7 departments propose to acquire a Zeiss LSM 780 Elyra PS1 Combi super-resolution fluorescence\r\nmicroscope to advance research along 3 themes; Cellular & Engineering Bioscience, Complex\r\nSystems, and Nanoscience. The microscope will be part of the Georgia Tech core facilities\r\nlocated in the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB). These core\r\nfacilities are available to any academic or industry researcher and we expect the super-resolution\r\nmicroscope will be a valuable tool for researchers throughout the Southeast. The core facilities\r\nalso provide professional staff to oversee maintenance and training, as well as long-term\r\nstewardship of the microscope. In addition to advances in research, this microscope will be\r\na valuable educational tool for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and\r\npostdoctoral researchers, both at Georgia Tech and in Atlanta.",
