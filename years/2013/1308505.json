Students will benefit from  attending  the conference, with its rich technical program of contributed and invited research talks, complemented by focused workshops, tutorials and other events. \r\n\r\nThe student travel awards will help enrich the eduation and training of a diverse group of young researchers, including women and members of underrepresented groups, working in Artificial Intelligence in general, and Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems in particular.",
