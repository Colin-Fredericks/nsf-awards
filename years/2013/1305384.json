Further,\r\nthe facility will enable forward-thinking research that re-considers\r\nthe technical and economic factors involved with the interplay\r\nbetween mobile networks, software defined networks and cloud technologies.\r\nThe availability of a physical facility will help researchers to\r\ntransition new mobile network designs from theory into practice.\r\nGiven that a large fraction of the world's population are already\r\nusers of such networks, and that fraction is growing, the research\r\nenabled by this infrastructure will have the potential to have truly\r\ntransformative impact.",
