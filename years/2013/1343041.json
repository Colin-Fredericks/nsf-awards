 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to further develop a comprehensive platform to compute Collective Social Intelligence from social media data. It currently uses Twitter as a starting point, and brings in news, multimedia, Wikipedia and Linked Open Data as complementary data and background knowledge for analysis. Its detailed analysis encompasses spatio-temporal-thematic (where, when, what), people-content-networking (who and how), and emotion-sentiment-intent (perceptions & impact). While social media capabilities are currently predominately used as a means of delivering messages, this technology is designed to gain insights and potentially predict trends using data gathered from social media.\r\n\r\nSocial media analysis will have broad implications on gaining insights on a wide variety of human activities, ranging from business to science and engineering. This project plans to support transitioning research on advanced social media analysis techniques and early state technology into their real world products and services to potentially help improve the quality of decision-makers and their products.",
