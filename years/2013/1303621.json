 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kristen Schilt\r\nAbigail Ocobock\r\nUniversity of Chicago\r\n\r\nThe  \"de-institutionalization\" theory of marriage is based on the assumption that marriage no longer provides external, informal rules for behavior.  Yet few have examined, explicitly, how marriage shapes and constrains social action today, or how people actually experience it as an institution. Same-sex marriage provides an interesting lens through which to investigate the theory because it suggests both the possibility of de-institutionalization, as adherence to traditional marital norms decline and marital practices become more varied, and the further institutionalization of marriage, as it expands to govern new populations.  Research has not kept pace with the rapidly changing institutional landscape of marriage.   Scholars have made important contributions to ongoing debates about same-sex marriage but the lived experiences of same-sex couples who gain the right to marry have received scant attention, Social scientists know little about how gay men and lesbians actually experience marriage and its impact on their lives. Does having the legal right to marry impact the decision to marry after the initial point of legalization? How does having access to marriage shape relationship choices and experiences as well as the meanings they attach to them? And beyond couple relationships, does marriage also impact family and community relationships?\r\n\r\nThis dissertation addresses these questions by comparing gay men and lesbians in Massachusetts, which has offered same-sex marriage since 2004 with their counterparts in Michigan, which adopted a constitutional ban on same-sex relationship recognition the same year.  It is a mixed methods study that includes the collection of data both through an online questionnaire and in-depth interviews. By comparing the experiences of gay men and lesbians with and without the right to legally marry, and investigating differences across married and unmarried groups, this study offers systematic, in-depth data about how the institution of marriage shapes couple, family and community relationships, making a significant contribution to both institutional and family scholarship.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nGiven the level of continuing social and political debate around same-sex marriage, this dissertation will generate detailed and reliable data about how same-sex couples experience marriage. This is essential for improving public understanding on the issue, and findings will be made accessible to a broader public audience through the publication of articles in mainstream media outlets as well as academic journals. In addition, reports of findings will be disseminated to policy makers, to provide them with empirical information that can be used to inform policies related to same-sex couples and their families.",
