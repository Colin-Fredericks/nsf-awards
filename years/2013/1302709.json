 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to identify principles by which information and computer scientists can design solutions for systems that will span periods extending beyond a single human lifespan.  The challenge is not simply that hardware, software, and information infrastructure change, but also that culture and social institutions change.  Thus the research will develop information systems that can adapt to shifting socio-technical conditions as they unfold; provide a delicate balance among remembering, forgetting, and speaking sensitive to different generations; support public discourse; and link distributed digital heritage across technology, institutions, and time.  To achieve these goals, the project will leverage the existing Tribunal Voices testbed within four research strands: (1) multi-lifespan envisioning; (2) tagging and meaning making across generations; (3) supporting public discourse in shifting socio-technical conditions; and (4) constructing multi-lifespan policy and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nMulti-lifespan systems must be resilient to shifting societal, political, and technological conditions over an extended period of time. A fundamental challenge is to understand what those shifts might be, and how to support such future shifts from a technical perspective in today's designs. This project will explore conceptual, technical, and policy-oriented mechanisms for adapting and supporting such shifts. Another fundamental challenge is determining how to involve the public in interacting with deployed multi-lifespan systems, with sensitivity to multi-generations.  This project will develop innovative methods to support public discourse for digital forums and public exhibits with attention to generational perspectives and secure participation. Multi-lifespan systems will need mechanisms for supporting the permanence of data, even as technologies change, as well as the intended impermanence of data. This project will develop integrated technical mechanisms and interaction designs to support a balance among remembering, forgetting, and speaking about difficult topics. \r\n\r\nThis will be the first large-scale research and design investigation from a multi-lifespan design approach. The goals are two-fold: First, achieving technical progress by generating general design knowledge and methods for multi-lifespan information system design.  Second, achieving social progress by contributing meaningful information system designs in support of advancing international justice and reconciliation between groups that had been in conflict with each other.  In its broadest framing, through the development and refining of the core theory and methods of multi-lifespan information system design, this project seeks to shape the future of human-centered computing such that the next generation of scientists is well positioned to frame and address problems on a longer-term societal level.",

Despite these short timeframes, technical systems are often employed to address any number of critical societal problems (e.g., social conflict and crime management, deforestation, chronic disease and epidemics). While information and the processes around information have much to contribute to the solutions of these problems, many of these problems require an approach that considers longer timeframes than the traditional technology development cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OUR APPROACH: The work conducted for this award developed multi-lifespan design to address this gap. In proposing this work, we identified three categories of multi-lifespan design problems: First, limitations on the human psyche, or our ability to heal from deep harms (e.g., harms resulting from war, genocide, and other extreme conflict). Second, limitations of the structure of society, or our ability to repair tears in the social fabric (e.g., the generational knowledge lost in communities decimated by pandemic). Third, natural times scales that move more slowly than a human lifespan, or the pace of non-human natural cycles (e.g., the re-growth of old growth forests). Over the course of the award we have developed theory, methods, best practices, and toolkits to support the design of technologies intended to address challenges that require thinking in the long term, beyond a single human lifespan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CASE STUDY: To investigate two of these problem categories?limitations of the human psyche and tears in the social fabric?we worked in the aftermath of genocide. Specifically, we developed the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal testbed, a collection of 49 video interviews with personnel from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (e.g., judges, translators, administrators, the warden). The award supported the development and refinement of the collection (e.g., providing transcripts online and improving the website) so that the collection could serve as a testbed for exploring multi-lifespan design. All of the interviews are accessible for reuse under a Creative Commons license from the website (<a href=\"http://www.tribunalvoices.org/)\">http://www.tribunalvoices.org/)</a> (see Figure 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OUTCOMES: We developed new technical design knowledge for thinking longer-term. We used the collection to develop design methods (envisioning workshops, multi-lifespan timeline, and multi-lifespan co-design), expand theory (around design and human conflict), define design mechanisms (pause), refine best practices (collaborative reflection), and build toolkits (multi-lifespan envisioning cards and metaphor cards). For example, the multi-lifespan envisioning cards stimulate thinking about technology and design solutions from a long-term perspective?20, 50, 100 years from now (see Figure 2). Similarly, the metaphor cards and co-design methods help technologists and designers generate new ideas while taking longer-term implications into account. In addition, our work also laid the foundation for a community of practice for designers and researchers interested in applying longer-term design thinking and multi-lifespan design to other contexts (e.g., cultural heritage, smart cities, and ecosystems).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BROADER IMPACTS: We have applied the multi-lifespan design approach to the design and implementation of information systems in support of international justice. The work holds promise for increasing the effectiveness of international justice institutions to reach those communities closely affected by crimes against humanity. Beyond international justice, the technical design knowledge and methods we produced have the potential for widespread impact across diverse sectors of society. For example, the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal collection can be accessed by the scientific community for use as a technical data set, by the legal community for legal scholarship, by documentary filmmakers for source material, and by the public for education and general interest. Most broadly, multi-lifespan design thinking, including the specific methods, mechanisms, and the toolkits, methods, and mechanisms developed under this award were designed to be easily adapted to diverse technologies and institutions. For example, they could be used to support cultural heritage (e.g., preserving diverse cultural identities), ecosystems (e.g., managing the interaction between natural and man-made systems), energy (e.g., considering new energy grids), smart cities (e.g., envisioning and planning urban infrastructure), or water (e.g., designing allocation and use systems for limited aquifers).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Batya&nbsp;Friedman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534399953_Figure1WebsiteScreenShot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534399953_Figure1WebsiteScreenShot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534399953_Figure1WebsiteScreenShot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal website.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Value Sensitive Design Lab, Information School, University of Washington</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Batya&nbsp;Friedman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534474017_Figure2Multi-lifespanEnvisioningCard-ReimaginingInfrastructure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534474017_Figure2Multi-lifespanEnvisioningCard-ReimaginingInfrastructure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1302709/1302709_10269791_1543534474017_Figure2Multi-lifespanEnvisioningCard-ReimaginingInfrastructure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample Multi-lifespan Envisioning Card.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Value Sensitive Design Lab, Information School, University of Washington</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Batya&nbsp;Friedman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
