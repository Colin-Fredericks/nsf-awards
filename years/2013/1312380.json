Three specific analyses will be considered: the Cosmic Microwave Background lensing signal by foreground galaxy clusters, the large angle CMB lensing versus temperature cross correlation, and an extension and improvement of ACT's measurements of galaxy motions via the mean pairwise velocity of galaxy clusters.  These three studies will advance the understanding of growth of structure in the universe and the nature of gravitation on cosmological scales.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, Dr. Kosowsky will organize a scientist-teacher partnership program in the Pittsburgh region, modeled on the successful NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education program.",

Most large galaxies harbor giant black holes in their centers, and heated gas swirling around the black hole gives off prodigious amounts of energy before being swallowed up. This energy can be enough to significantly heat the gas in the rest of the galaxy, but it is very difficult to measure the gas&nbsp; temperature directly. We made an indirect measurement by showing that the microwave background radiation passing through these galaxies has its intensity suppressed at lower frequencies. This effect, known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, has been well explored in galaxy clusters, which are much larger and have hotter gas. In individual galaxies, the effect is too small to see. Again, we averaged together the signal from thousands of individual galaxies to see a mean effect. By comparing with theoretical models of the gas temperature of galaxies without any heating from a black hole, we showed that it is likely that 5 to 10 percent of the energy coming out of the black hole goes into heating the gas.
