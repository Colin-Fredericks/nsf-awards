 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project seeks to improve understanding of precipitation processes in mixed phase orographic clouds and the variation in the isotopic signature of snowfall that is associated with aerosol effects on cloud microphysics.  The study will use measurements and modeling of the isotopic content of water vapor, cloud water, and snow at the Desert Research Institute's (DRI's) Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL, altitude 3210 m) to test the hypotheses that: 1) variations in the isotopic composition of snow associated with riming and riming inhibition are significant; and 2) the isotopic composition and chemistry of cloud droplets near cloud base and falling snow are sufficient to resolve the relative roles of vapor deposition and riming in snow growth. \r\n\r\nModel simulations with a new isotope-enabled version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used to test observation-based inferences on snow formation by riming and vapor deposition, the altitudes at which they occur, and the effects of variation of aerosol concentration on the isotopic composition of snowfall. The sensitivity of the isotopic composition of snowfall to aerosol-induced changes in the rimed mass fraction will be evaluated with model simulations over a range of aerosol concentration based on observational case studies representing a variety of meteorological and synoptic conditions during wintertime storms at SPL.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nRiming of ice crystals in wintertime orographic clouds significantly enhances their water content and the amount of water deposited in snowfall.  The isotopic composition of precipitation at a given location reflects local cloud processes as well as the history of upwind condensation, evaporation and mixing. In the work, the impact of aerosol-induced changes in mixed phase orographic clouds on the isotopic content of snowfall will be explored.  Inhibition of snow growth by riming due to aerosol-induced reduction of cloud droplet size has been observed in wintertime storms at SPL.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe contribution of isotope-enabled microphysical models to the WRF community during this project will allow for broader application of these methodologies in studies of general circulation and the water cycle.  The isotopic signal recorded in glacial ice has been used as a proxy record of past climates. Low-level riming over glacial ice may contribute to a component of the isotopic signal that is independent of global temperature. This project involves the participation and training of graduate students from DRI and Harvard in the field program and modeling studies.  During the field experiment season, SPL will host atmospheric science field courses from the University of Wisconsin, North Carolina State University, and the University of Colorado for undergraduate and graduate students.  As part of this work, a series of lectures will be presented to each of these classes on the use of isotopic signatures in environmental science. Reports on SPL research projects have appeared on CNN, NBC, National Public Radio, National Geographic Explorer, local television stations, in newspapers across the U.S., and the NCAR EOL Channel (http://tinyurl.com/ISPAscience). SPL is integrally involved in the Steamboat Weather Summit of meteorologists from television stations around the country. These activities will coincide with the winter field study at SPL and a talk on this work will be presented at the Weather Summit. The investigators will also present a community lecture in Steamboat Springs and an \"open house\" at SPL to share the scientific motivation of this research. Finally, a curriculum developed to provide middle school students with hand-on learning focused on meteorology and climate will continue with the project and have classes observe weather balloons launches during the field study.",

This was a collaborative effort between the Desert Research Institute of the Nevada System of Higher Education, the University of Washington, and Harvard University. Its goal was to improve our understanding of precipitation processes in wintertime mixed-phase (liquid and ice) orographic mountain clouds which supply much of the water for human use in mountainous regions around the world. The stable isotopic composition (natural, not radioactive!) of atmospheric water vapor (humidity), snow and liquid cloud water provided insight into how snow formed at the Desert Research Institute&rsquo;s Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL, 3210 m MSL) near Steamboat Springs in northwestern Colorado. As snow falls through liquid clouds and the temperature is below freezing, it collects liquid cloud droplets which freeze onto the snow crystals when the droplets and the crystals collide. This process, known as &ldquo;riming&rdquo;, which is similar to what occurs when ice forms on airplane wings, supplies a significant fraction of the snow water which falls to the ground and forms the snowpack. The isotopic composition of the snow and cloud droplets sampled at SPL can tell us how important the riming process is in snow formation. One of the goals of this study was the development of an enhanced version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that includes the isotopic composition of water vapor, liquid cloud, and snow in its predictions.

Sampling was conducted when SPL was immersed in a liquid cloud and it was snowing. These conditions existed on 14 days. The differences in isotopic composition between water vapor and liquid cloud and between water vapor and snow were similar from day to day, consistent with what would be expected from transport of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean to SPL, a distance of over 1000 miles, and consistent removal of water by precipitation along the way. While snow crystals can form high in the atmosphere, perhaps up to 5 kilometers above SPL, the isotopic composition of the liquid cloud and snow at SPL showed that most of the snow&rsquo;s mass was formed within 1 kilometer above SPL. Based on theory, the isotopic composition of cloud water at SPL was closely reproduced from the water vapor composition at SPL. This was not the case for snow, which demonstrated that the water vapor composition changed with height above SPL. The vertical stratification of the isotopic composition of water vapor is consistent with our ideas about how air masses are transported over long distances through the atmosphere. The difference between cloud and snow isotopic composition was very small on 7 of 14 days, demonstrating that snow on these days gained much of its mass and isotopic signature from riming close to SPL. Thus, near-surface riming can have a significant effect on the isotopic composition of deposited snow. These results were published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology in 2016.
