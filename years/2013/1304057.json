  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of this postdoctoral fellowship can be grouped into roughly three categories of work: random matrices, random tilings of homogeneous spaces, and the power of choice phenomenon.\n\nOne major theme addressed in the work on random matrices is the connection between log-correlated Gaussian fields and random matrices.  The general theory of log-correlated Gaussian fields has been developed recently to include rigorous understanding of quantities such as the maxima and exponentials of these fields.  Meanwhile, certain random matrix statistics, such as the characteristic polynomial, are known to have some distributional features matching Gaussian log-correlated fields in the large matrix limit.  This leads to a natural family of conjectures: the general predictions that hold true for the maxima and exponential of Gaussian log-correlated fields hold for these random matrix objects.  Multiple papers projects performed by the PI while supported by this fellowship directly addressed conjectures of this nature, and partially resolved some outstanding ones.\n\nAnother topic addressed by the PI is that of random tilings of homogeneous spaces.   This has been an active field of research, particularly in studies of uniform random triangulations of the 2-dimensional sphere.  The nature of the tilings studied by the PI are more in line with the theory of lattices.  These are collections of points, the nuclei, in the homogeneous space that are invariant under isometry.  Such collections of points beget tilings of the space by building cells in the space around each nuclei (for example Voronoi cells).  Work completed in this project investigates some of the geometric features of such tilings when the points are chosen, in some sense, as random as possible.\n\nThe power of choice phenomenon was a final theme investigated during this project.  The power of choice was coined in reference to the following online queuing algorithm: suppose that a large number of tasks are to be assigned to a large number of servers.  Servers can work on a single task at a time, and suppose the number of servers equals the number of tasks.  With perfect information and memory, one can assign tasks to servers so that each server processes a single task.  With no information and no memory, one can still assign tasks to servers randomly, which will still perform relatively well, in that the server with the most assigned tasks will have about the logarithm of the number tasks assigned to it.  If one is allowed a small amount of information: at each step, one can inspect two servers to see how many tasks are currently queued, then one can assign the task to the server with the fewer tasks.  This strategy leads to maximum task load of an iterated logarithm of the number of tasks, and this reduction in load from logarithm to iterated logarithm is called the power of choice.  Work of the PI in this direction focused on other random growth models in which there may or may not be a power of choice phenomenon: in preferential attachment graphs and in geometric equidistribution.  \n\nBroader impacts: During the Fellowship, the PI mentored an undergraduate working in random geometry as part of the Kupcinet--Getz international science school.  The PI also worked with a visiting graduate student in random graphs.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elliot Paquette"
