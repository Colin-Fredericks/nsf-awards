 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Newtonian N-body problem suffers (or enjoys) two difficulties not shared by the typical dynamical systems of general  theory: collision singularities  which render the  flow incomplete, and symmetries  which make all its periodic orbits degenerate. The investigator and his colleague eliminate these two difficulties. They eliminate collision singularities by Levi-Civita regularization, Kuustaanheimo-Steifel regularization or McGehee blow-up.  They eliminate the symmetries by symplectic reduction and invariant theory. They call the resulting regularized reduced flow the \"global regularization.\"  This flow is complete and has   the minimum number of degrees of freedom possible among for a  flow encoding the N-body problem. Given the global regularization, the investigator and his colleague study previously inaccessible problems within the N-body problem, such as the dynamical and variational  nature of collision-collision solutions, and the existence or lack of existence of a symbolic dynamics for  the planar zero-angular momentum three-body problem whose 3 symbols are the 3 types of syzygies (collinearities).  \r\n\r\nImagine the moon going around the earth,  the earth going around the sun, and the sun spinning around the galaxy. The dominant force in the large scale dynamics of the universe is the attractive force of gravity and is responsible for the large scale rotational type  motions of celestial bodies.  The N-body equations are the equations governing this motion. (\"N\" stands for the number of bodies.)  When two bodies get close the forces get large to the point that when the bodies  collide the  forces become infinity.  This infinity  is called a \"collision singularity.\" If the whole universe is translated, or rotated some fixed amount, the motion remains identical and so there are extra variables in the usual N-body equations, namely the variables describing the \"origin\" and \"axes\" of the universe.  The investigator and his collaborator eliminate the collision singularities, and the extra variables in the N-body equations. These eliminations yield a potentially more useful  system of equations for the motion,  a system  free of infinities which may provide a good platform from which to solve some of the many open problems about one of the dominant dynamical behaviors going on in our  universe.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Three massive bodies attracting each other under gravitation execute a dance as they move around each other.  If  their motion is periodic,  in the plane (as opposed to space)  and if the bodies never collide with each other, then the ``topology'' of this dance can be observed and recorded. For example  A and B  might go around each other 5 times counterclockwise, then B might move closer to C and then B and C might wind once clockwise  around each other and then the motion repeats.   ( A, B and C label the three bodies. )  We have proved that all ``dances'' (technically ``free homotopy classes'')  imaginable  are actually  realized by an honest motion (technically: a solution to Newton's differential equations).   This result represents the culmination of 17 years of work.  However, the theorem described only holds when the total angular momentum is small but nonzero, whereas most of that 17 years was spent on the zero angular momentum problem.   Strong evidence suggests that the `simplest dances'': A and B spinning around each other with C quite distant, are not realized as periodic solutions for the zero angular momentum equal mass three body problem. \n\nThe N-body problem concerns the motion of some (possibly large) number  N of masses moving according to gravitation.  A regime of the N-body problem far from that of the periodic `dances'   described above (in the N=3 body problem) arises when the bodies move  quite fast relative to their  common center of mass.  In this high energy regime the gravitaitonal force just barely bends the trajectories of the particles as they get close. The motion is more like that of  bullets flying past each other., than that of dancers gracefully spinning around each other.  Only when the bodies become extremely close, or actually hit, is there any deflection.  In this high energy limit we showed that we could accurately model the situation as  mathematical ``billiards'' . We then classified the possible ingoing and outgoing states of motion and established facts regarding the structure of this space of motion. \n\nMethods  developed in the course of this research include  higher dimensional geometry,  the regularizing of collisions (where forces go to infinity), and are proving already  to be useful to up and coming researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard W Montgomery"
