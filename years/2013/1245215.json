 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: This project integrates recommendations by the Vision and Change initiative to revise and revitalize the first year biology sequence at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK).  A community-based approach is being used to monitor and document the integration of Vision and Change concepts, competencies, and research by UTK biologists into three courses.  Faculty and graduate students are developing new instructional strategies and assessing the impacts on student learning.  In part, the effort involves 1) developing and implementing a new curriculum, 2) providing professional development for the UTK biology community, 3) assessing and evaluating student learning in light of the curricular changes, and 4) disseminating the student learning and curriculum change results.  The project is providing one model of how an outcomes-based and community-based reform at a large state university can integrate Vision and Change into introductory biology courses.  The creation and use of open-ended assessments based on Vision and Change concepts is also building capacity in assessment of undergraduate biology learning.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: By engaging dozens of UTK faculty, graduate students, and staff in best practices for teaching and learning, the project is providing thousands of undergraduates the tools to become more biologically literate.  It prepares students for open-ended questioning, and encourages them to think like biologists.  Moreover, the project functions as a model of reform whose deliverables are freely available for use by other institutions.  UTK community members are also visiting selected institutions to encourage them to enact similar curricular reforms within their introductory biology courses.",

There were two overall goals of the project: 1) To align national concepts and competencies (as defined by the NSF/AAAS <em>Vision and Change</em> Report) with the introductory biology sequence at UTK, and 2) To integrate small group discussions focused on research into lectures and labs in the introductory sequence. The project was supported by four faculty PIs, two graduate research assistants, and one external evaluator. All curriculum revisions were done as part of learning communities created for the project. For concept and competency alignment, the fifteen faculty members who taught the introductory courses worked together over a three-year period to agree on new standards for course content and implementation. External and internal consultants met with the group and shared teaching ideas. The research assistants observed the course delivery, interviewed faculty, and surveyed students, and iteratively presented these data to the group each semester. These data showed that student outcomes were aligned with the new foci of the courses, and that faculty increasingly used pedagogical approaches (such as group active learning and written activities) shown to improve student learning. These changes occurred despite the loss of one lecture hour per week to the new small group discussions. Interviews of faculty captured changes in teaching perspectives that occurred over the course of the project. They shifted in their conceptualization of active learning and their thinking about assessment (Auerbach and Schussler, <em>CBE LSE</em> 2017, 16: article 57). The group expressed that they appreciated the consideration, compromise, and consensus of the community process. For the creation of the small group discussion sessions, we solicited volunteer undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and faculty members to form curriculum pods for each new discussion course (two lecture courses and one lab). These groups worked together over one year to create the policies, goals, and activities for each course. After this time, the faculty member in charge of coordinating the course completed the details of the curriculum. Assessment of the pods indicated that the groups were dedicated to making a difference in the curriculum structure and valued the opportunity to participate in the process. Although they were frustrated by how long the process took, they were proud of their achievements by the end (Dalrymple et al., <em>IJSoTL</em> 2017, 11: article 5). One question was whether changing the curriculum from two 4-credit courses (each with a lab) to three courses (one lab course and two lecture courses with small group discussions) would change student scientific literacy. We found some benefits and few losses to reducing lab time and increasing discussion time in the introductory sequence (Auerbach and Schussler, <em>CBE LSE</em> 2017, 16: article 29). Recent extensions of this work have investigated maintenance of active learning in the courses, and student response to active learning. We continued observations of classroom instruction two years beyond the three-year project period. We found that one of the courses continued to increase in the use of active learning, while the other decreased. The proportional use of group active learning continued to increase in both courses. Instructors who were new to the courses often maintained or exceeded the active learning levels of previous cohorts. Although most students appreciate active learning, there is a small percent of students who experience anxiety in response to its use. This anxiety varies with the type of active learning and the instructor who is employing the practice (England, Brigati, and Schussler, <em>PlosONE</em> 2017; 12: e0182506). Higher anxiety levels early in the course are correlated with lower course performance and higher intention to leave the major (England, Brigati, and Schussler, <em>CBE LSE</em> in revision). Not all the anxiety is related to active learning, however, with many students attributing more than half of their anxiety to test anxiety, the pace of the course, or confusion about the content. In total, the project generated 4 publications, has two manuscripts in review or revision, 14 conference presentations, and 6 invited talks. The invited talks focused on lessons learned from the project and how other institutions can enact their own <em>Vision and Change</em> curriculum revisions. Overall, this project changed not only the curriculum, but also the culture of teaching and learning in introductory biology. The instructors of the introductory sequence still meet regularly to talk about curriculum and instruction approaches. Data are collected and returned to the group for consideration. The discussion curricula have undergone a minor revision this year, which was led by some graduate students, and the lab discussions are about to be expanded. As we hoped when we wrote the proposal, we met the goals of the project by working together as a community to enact change.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/14/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elisabeth&nbsp;E&nbsp;Schussler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
