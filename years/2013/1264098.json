 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use moored velocity and hydrographic time series to quantify the input of the warm Atlantic Water emanating from Fram Strait into the Arctic Ocean and determine the dynamics of the flow that lead to exchange with interior waters. This is made possible through collaboration with scientists from five international research institutions (known collectively as the ATWAIN project) who will contribute moorings and provide the ship time. Together, 9 moorings will be deployed across the Atlantic Water boundary current for a full year in a configuration that will resolve the relevant dynamical scales of the current. Four of the moorings will be provided by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and five by ATWAIN. The array will be deployed and recovered using a Norwegian ice-strengthened vessel. The funds to fabricate all of the moorings and the technician time to deploy and recover them have already been obtained through a combination of private sources (for the WHOI moorings) and foreign funding agencies (for the ATWAIN moorings). In this proposal the PI is seeking support for (i) participation on the recovery cruise by the PI and a shipboard technician; (ii) processing of the mooring data and shipboard hydrographic/velocity data; (iii) scientific analysis of the resulting observational data in conjunction with the foreign collaborators; (iv) a graduate student to work on the project; and (v) an outreach program.\r\n\r\nThe flow and modification of warm Atlantic Water within the Arctic Ocean contributes to the waters that form the Meridional Overturning Circulation, sometimes known as the ocean conveyor belt, that is a major aspect of the global climate system.  This project will significantly enhance our understanding of the time and space varying processes contributing to that modification.",

There is enough heat stored in this layer to melt the pack-ice on the surface, but the heat is trapped by the presence of colder and fresher water above it. It is of high importance to understand how the warm Atlantic layer is maintained and how it might be changing in time; for instance, might it be getting closer to impacting the ice? The goal of our project was to describe and quantify one of the major sources of Atlantic Water (AW) into the eastern Arctic: the so-called Svalbard branch of the AW boundary current (see the figure). Relatively little is known about the current, and year-long measurements of the flow are rare. In collaboration with institutions from Norway and Poland, we deployed a high-resolution mooring array across the current from September 2012 to September 2013. This is the first time that such a detailed view of the current has been obtained. <br /><br />The results of our study have fundamentally improved the community's understanding of the structure, strength, and seasonality of the Svalbard branch. Among other things, we determined that, averaged over the year, the current transports 2 million cubic meters per second of AW eastward. The current is typically subsurface intensified, and its dominant variability is associated with pulsing rather than meandering back and forth. From late-summer to early-winter the AW is warmest and saltiest, and its eastward transport is strongest, while from mid-spring to mid-summer the AW is coldest and freshest and its transport is weakest. This seasonality is largely (but not completely) dictated by the upstream input of AW through Fram Strait, with a delay of approximately two months, which is the time it takes the water to move that distance. <br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising discovery was that the AW is able to be modified locally by air-sea interaction. In particular, strong heat loss to the atmosphere caused convective overturning to occur, whereby the surface water becomes denser than the underlying water and consequently sinks. This results in a well-mixed layer that becomes progressively deeper in time as the heat loss continues. We found that the mixed layer deepened enough to reach the AW layer and modify the warm and salty water. This ventilation lasted until early spring when the region became covered by pack ice (which shielded the surface water from further heat loss). Our results suggest that, as the ice cover continues to decrease in this part of the Arctic Ocean due to climate change, the AW will be more extensively transformed via local air-sea interaction. This could have far-reaching impacts on the functioning of the Arctic Ocean. <br /><br />During the cruises when the mooring array was deployed and recovered, we carried out extensive shipboard surveys of the region. During this work we discovered and mapped out a large rotating lens of AW that had pinched off from the current. Detailed investigation of this feature, together with further analysis of the mooring data, suggests that such swirls of AW should be spawned regularly and thereby represent an effective mechanism for fluxing the warm and salty water offshore into the interior basin. This provides a clue as to why AW is found so extensively throughout the Arctic Ocean. Finally, we documented that wind-forcing could cause an exchange of water between the Svalbard branch and the region offshore. In sum, our project shed great light on the means by which warm water from the Atlantic Ocean invades the Arctic domain, and how this process might be altered under a warming climate. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;S&nbsp;Pickart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264098/1264098_10244763_1564878297408_outcomes1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264098/1264098_10244763_1564878297408_outcomes1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Study region\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1264098/1264098_10244763_1564878297408_outcomes1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Study region\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Geographical map showing the schematic circulation of the Atlantic Water (red lines).
