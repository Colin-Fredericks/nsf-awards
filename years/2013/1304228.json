 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has two main objectives: 1) determination of the physical and microbial characteristics and microstructural evolution of sea ice exposed to severe melt; and 2) exploration of the influence of biogenic particles such as sea ice algae, bacteria and polymer gels on the melting behavior of sea ice. This research will develop and apply state-of-the-art microbiological, molecular, biogeochemical and geophysical techniques to examine the character and evolution of natural Arctic sea ice at the end of the melt season at field sites near Barrow, Alaska. This project will assess: (1) ice physical characteristics (ice density, salinity, permeability, albedo, and microstructure) using standard and novel microscopy and X-ray computed tomography techniques; (2) ice algal and bacterial characteristics (abundance, activity, biomass, productivity and diversity) using epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and massively parallel taq sequencing techniques; (3) polymer gel characteristics (abundance, composition, gel carbon biomass, and size) using in situ microscopy, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy techniques; and (4) the relationship between biogenic particles and ice physical characteristics, in particular microstructural properties for melted and intact ice samples using image analysis and correlative statistical methods. This proposed project will carry out educational outreach by offering research experience to an undergraduate student, mentoring a postdoctoral research associate, and entrainment of relevant scientific results into both academic curricula and public outreach.",

Retreat in areal extent and reductions in total thickness have been profound. With record Arctic sea ice melt year after year, the time is ripe to advance our understanding of a privously uncharacterized type of ice: heavily melted or 'rotten' summer time sea ice and its possible impact on a changing Arctic ecosystem and climate. Here we laid the ground work for such predictions by describing the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of rotten sea ice. We found that as this ice exhibits profoundly different physical structures and optical characteristics compared to earlier summer ice. It also harbors a unique and distinctly different microbial community possibly adapted to a warmer, lower nutrient, and more fresh environment.</p>\n<p>During the summer in 2015 and 2017 our team sampled summer time sea ice off the coast near Utqiagvik (formerly&nbsp;Barrow) Alaska accessing the heavily rotten ice with boats&nbsp;(Figure 1). We found that this ice is much more porous, with a lower density compared to earlier season ice and contains 'swiss cheese' - like microstructures with large channels throughout the entire ice column (Figure 1). We also discovered that algae and bacteria remain present in this type of ice (Figure 2) and that the microorgnisms living in late melt season ice are distinctly different from the ones living in sea ice earlier in the spring and summer. For example, we observed more centric diatoms and a host of different bacterial groups to be present&nbsp;reflecting the differences observed in salt (less) and nutrient content (less) and particulate polymers (more) present later in the season (Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Polymer gels (mucus released mostly by algae and some by bacteria) are important components of sea ice habitats as they aid the organisms in cryoprotection but also might have a role in shaping the structure of the ice thereby possibly influencing its melt behavior. To study this further, we developed in&nbsp;the laboratory an ice melt chamber (Figure 4) that allowed us to study the melt behavior of ice samples of different structures and polymer content. In our first tests, we found that ice amended with polymers can melt up to 15% slower compared to unamended ice samples. This could have important implications for the Arctic sea ice melt, since ice with higher populations of algea containing higher mucus (polymer gel) content could melt more slowly thereby impacting the overall ice melt. With warmer temperatures, earlier algae blooms and&nbsp;possibly higher algae biomasses predicted, this could be an important overlooked component of the Arctic climate puzzle. However, these findings are the first of its kind, are only of preliminary nature and more in depth studies are needed to fully understand how the microstructure of the ice will affect its melt behavior and how such microstructural changes translates to the bigger climate related questions. An important question to address given that accurate climate predictions rely on accurate ice melt predictions.</p>\n<p>Results of this research have been presented at several national conferences, have been published in peer-reviewed publications and a book chapter.
