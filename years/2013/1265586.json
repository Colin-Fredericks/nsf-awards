 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his research group will investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in (1) beryllium clusters containing 3 - 30 Be atoms, (2) hypermetallic MOM with M=Mg and Ca; (3) alkaline earth carbides; and (4) the diatomic ions CaO+, BaO+ and BaCl+. These clusters and molecules have been the subject of numerous theoretical investigations, but experimental data are lacking. The ultimate goal is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of bonding that are not well-characterized in terms of conventional models, and to advance our understanding of bonding when clusters grow from a few atoms in size to large systems that approach bulk metal behavior. In addition, the studies of the carbides MgC and CaC will be of value to the astrophysical community, while work on the molecular ions CaO+, BaO+ and BaCl+ will advance research programs where the aim is to generate and manipulate ultra-cold (<mK) molecules for applications such as quantum computing. A variety of experimental tools will be employed, including anion photodetachment, laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results from these studies will help chemists to develop a deeper understanding of bonding that encompasses the traditional models as well as the unusual interactions that are one of the themes of the present study. The research will provide the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods. A successful collaboration with Spelman College, that provides research opportunities to students from a historically Black women's college, will be continued.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  The primary objectives of this program were to investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in compounds of the alkaline earth metals (group IIA).  These molecules are of fundamental interest as they exhibit modes of bonding that are not well characterized by conventional models. The ultimate goal is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of bonding, which will then facilitate the search for new materials.\n\n  A new instrument was constructed to characterize the alkaline earth compounds by means of anion photodetachment techniques.  In this apparatus the molecules of interest were prepared as negatively charged ions, and separated from other products by means of mass spectrometry.  Laser excitation was used to eject the additional electrons, and an imaging technique was used to measure the energy distribution of the ejected electrons.  This instrument has been used to characterize the AlO-, BeO- and BeS- anions for the first time.  The data provide rigorous tests for the current theoretical models for the anions.\n\n  Bonding in the molecules Be2, MgOMg and CaOCa has been explored using spectroscopic measurements and theoretical models.  The Be-Be bond is particularly difficult to understand, and an accurate model of the forces acting between two Be atoms has been developed.  The hypermetallic oxides MgOMg and CaOCa have been observed for the first time.  These molecules also provide rigorous tests of the current generation of electronic structure models of bonding, as they reveal subtle details of electron-electron interactions.\n\n  Diatomic molecular ions of the group IIA metals have great potential for the investigation of chemical processes at ultra-cold temperatures (below 10-3 K), where the wave nature of matter dominates.  Spectroscopic data for these ions are an essential prerequisite for progress in this field.  As part of the NSF supported program we recorded the first spectra for the CaO+, BaO+ and BaCl+ ions.\n\n  Three post-doctoral fellows, five graduate students, three undergraduates and three visiting Professors have been involved in our NSF supported research program to date.  Two of the post-doctoral fellows have moved on to academic appointments. Dr. Jacob Stewart is now an Assistant Professor at Connecticut College and Dr. Adrian Gardner is a Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham (UK).  Dr. Daniel Frohman joined our group in 2015.
