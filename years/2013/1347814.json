 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln aims at bridging the gap between research and practice in STEM education.  The project is drawing upon prior research on effective pedagogies and theories of change to effect institutional transformation in undergraduate STEM education with a particular emphasis on introductory classes where student attrition is most pronounced.   Within the implementation component of the project, over one hundred faculty members in fourteen STEM departments are being provided professional development on research based instructional strategies and course design.   The faculty members are using this professional development to change their instructional practices with the overall goal of improving student learning outcomes.  This is impacting approximately 5000 students, including a significant number of underrepresented students, over the life of the project.  The research team will use this context of instructional transformation to study factors that influence faculty and departmental adoption of effective pedagogies.  The results of these studies are contributing to the higher education knowledge base and could influence how other institutions seek to enact transformations in STEM teaching and learning.  The research results are being broadly disseminated to other institutions and to the public through a variety of mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of the Adopting Research-based Instructional Strategies for Enhancing (ARISE) STEM Education project was to create a sustainable model for transforming and supporting STEM education using research-based instructional strategies in STEM courses, with an emphasis on large introductory-level courses taught in 14 STEM departments at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).  A key factor in the ability of the United States to remain economically competitive is the ability of universities to educate the next generation of the STEM workforce.  This will require institutions to increase and diversify the student body studying STEM disciplines.  To do this, faculty need to better understand how students learn engineering and adopt research based instructional strategies that increase student learning and allow a broader student body to succeed in undergraduate STEM curricula. \n\nWe recognized three central considerations to transforming STEM education: (i) content matter expertise does not translate to pedagogical expertise, (ii) nurturing communities of practice support experimentation and implementation of teaching practices that are new to any given faculty member, and (iii) the culture and practice around evaluating and rewarding effective teaching is not fully developed. The ARISE STEM Education project was designed with three major components that specifically address these three considerations. The first major component involved professional development workshops for STEM faculty.

The project resulted in the institutionalization of the Engineering and Computing Education Core that provides resources and support for engineering faculty towards the UNL College of Engineering?s mission of providing excellent post-secondary education through ABET-Accredited programs.
