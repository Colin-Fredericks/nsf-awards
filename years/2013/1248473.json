 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the\r\nproblem of learning predictive models of individual choice behavior using sparse\r\ninformation on the behavior of any single individual. The intellectual merit of the\r\nproject is developing a novel parsimonious view of this problem by modeling\r\nchoice behavior as a distribution over permutations of alternatives, and making\r\nthis view implementable at scale. A unit of data in this paradigm is a single\r\ncomparison between two alternatives. Data of this sort can be derived in a variety\r\nof contexts ranging from product reviews to transaction data. While being a\r\nparsimonious modeling viewpoint, exact computation, or even representing such\r\nmodels is intractable. The project will focus on developing approximate solutions\r\nthat, in the spirit of recent advances in high-dimensional statistics, exploit the\r\npotential of sparse approximations to such models. Given the vast quantities of\r\ndata available to build such models it will be important for the algorithms\r\ndeveloped to be amenable to parallelization in a manner reminiscent of the\r\nMap/Reduce computational paradigm. The algorithms developed will fit this\r\nparadigm with key algorithmic steps decomposing across data collected for a\r\nsingle individual. In summary, this project will develop a massively parallelizable\r\napproach to modeling individual choice behavior using unstructured data from a\r\nvariety of sources.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project rests in enabling the\r\nemerging, all pervasive transition from 'search' to 'discovery'. This transition can\r\nbe witnessed in sectors ranging from e-commerce to offline retail to matching\r\nimpressions to advertisers on demand side platforms. The key stumbling block in\r\nthis transition is the seeming requirement to build attribute rich models for a given\r\ncontext as opposed to a black box approach. The approach taken in this project\r\nis of the latter variety. As a concrete example, the task of merchandising requires\r\nan offline retailer to decide on the right assortment of products to carry in\r\nsegments ranging from tooth paste to clothing; the approach here will power such\r\ndecision making in an entirely data driven fashion. In a different direction, serving\r\nads based on models that capture a surfer's preferences across the various silos\r\nof products and topics on the web can be enabled at scale and incredible\r\ngranularity using the approach here. The level of granularity made possible by\r\nthe approach here cannot be achieved with 'parametric' attribute driven\r\napproaches. In summary, the tools developed in this project have the potential to\r\ndo for `discovery' what the PageRank algorithm did for search.",
