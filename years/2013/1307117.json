 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Eric Fossum of Wright State University will utilize meta-activated nucleophilic aromatic substitution as a facile route to prepare poly(arylene ether)s with a multitude of functional groups located in pendent positions. Three different approaches will be employed including: 1) the introduction of azide moieties, via the corresponding iodo derivative, allowing for \"clickable\" systems, 2) utilization of functional sulfonamide groups as the activating group for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and 3) reactivity ratio controlled polycondensation reactions of BB'B\"-type monomers, which provide the possibility of functionalization either before or after the polymerization process.  The thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers will be evaluated as well as their potential for application as engineering thermoplastics. The broader impacts involve training master's, undergraduate, and high school students in research methods, disseminating results in publications and seminars, as well as the development of a new class of chemically robust polymeric materials suitable for a wide variety of applications.\r\n\r\nPolymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  This work will enhance our ability to synthesize new engineering plastics with excellent environmental stability and properties that can be readily tailored to meet a specific need. The results of these studies may have many positive, long-term impacts on applications in which engineering plastics are currently employed, including the energy, medical, automotive, electronics, and aerospace industries.",

One of the key advantages to this methodology is that the functionality resides in a truly pendent position, relative to the backbone of the polymer.  As such, a wide variety of functional materials can be prepared from a relatively small number of monomeric species.  In addition, since the various functional groups are located in identical positions, these new materials provide an exceptional opportunity for the development of thorough structure-property relationships.  The introduction of new functionality into the systems allows the researcher to readily tailor the properties of the material to meet a specific need. \n\n            The primary scientific outcome of this project was the introduction of functionality to PAEs, via the use of sulfonamide, sulfone, and benzophenone type monomers, each of which was designed to undergo meta activated NAS reactions (Figure 1).

Similar results were achieved with the N-alkyl-N-aryl based systems with the additional capability to introduced functional groups such as allyl, iodo-aryl, and benzoate.
