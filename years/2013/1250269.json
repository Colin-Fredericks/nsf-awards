 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades it has become clear that the continental crust can be heated to extreme, ?ultrahigh? temperatures (UHT) in excess of 900 \u00b0C (about 1650 \u00b0F) over large regions during metamorphism and mountain building events. How metamorphic rocks of the crust reach such extreme temperatures remains a fundamental unresolved problem in the geosciences, with major implications for rock strength, generation of magmas (which may ascend from depth to produce ore deposits and volcanic eruptions), heat transfer, and Earth?s overall heat budget. This project will focus on newly-discovered UHT rocks in northeastern Connecticut, the first regional UHT locality found in the United States. The rocks underwent extreme temperature conditions of roughly 1000 \u00b0C (more than 1800 \u00b0F) at depths of at least 35 km (about 22 miles) below the surface during Appalachian mountain building in the Devonian Period. This discovery will force a rethinking of how the deep rocks of the Appalachian mountains were formed, and shed new light on how UHT conditions can be reached. Moreover, the rocks contain abundant evidence for the former presence of CO2-rich fluids at ultrahigh temperatures, and thus could have important implications for carbon cycling in the crust and the long-term carbon cycle.  \r\n\r\nFundamental hypotheses for UHT metamorphism will be tested including: rapid exhumation from the mantle; underthrusting of radiogenic crust; asthenospheric upwelling; mechanical strain heating; heat input from mantle-derived magmas; and heat transfer by fluids. Basic data collection will involve field mapping of geologic relations; electron microprobe analyses of minerals; bulk chemical analyses of rocks; U-Pb dating of zircons by ion microprobe; and micro-Raman analyses of mineral and fluid inclusion types. These data will be used to determine pressure-temperature-time histories for the rocks; crustal fluid compositions; radiogenic heat production due to the decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium; and other geologic variables critical for hypothesis testing. The project will support and train Yale Ph.D. and undergraduate students, and integrate research results into public science outreach programs at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.",

The rocks formed at extreme temperatures greater than 1000 <sup>o</sup>C (over 1800 <sup>o</sup>F) during the mountain building events that produced the Appalachian mountain chain. How metamorphic rocks of Earth&rsquo;s crust reach such extreme temperatures remains as a fundamental problem in the geosciences, with major implications for rock strength, generation of magmas (which may ascend from depth to produce ore deposits and volcanic eruptions), heat transfer, and Earth&rsquo;s overall heat budget. There are only about 60 localities around the world which host these \"UHT\" rocks; our group's discovery of them in CT is the only confirmed regional occurrence in the United States. The extreme temperatures were reached during deep burial and compression due to continental collisions that ultimately produced the supercontinent Pangaea some 300-400 million years ago. Garnet crystals in the rocks contain a wide variety of mineral inclusions that provide important clues regarding rock formation processes. These inclusions typically have very regular geometric orientations controlled by the crystallography of garnet. Work done by Ph.D. student Jennifer Axler documented two new forms of mineral inclusions that will be valuable \"exploration tools\" for rocks formed at extreme conditions in other parts of the United States and the world. Axler&rsquo;s work on uranium-lead (U/Pb) dating of the mineral zircon and modeling of zircon behavior at extreme conditions will contribute significantly to our understanding of the timing of metamorphic events. Pre-existing zircons in the rocks were largely destroyed during UHT heating due to incorporation of zirconium into rutile, silicate melt, and garnet; then, new &ldquo;neo-formed&rdquo; zircons grew when the rocks cooled. In this way, the widespread Neoacadian (~360 million years ago) ages we have obtained are interpreted as \"cooling ages\" following UHT conditions. The occurrence of such zircon together with the rarity or absence of pre-metamorphic (detrital) grains is another potential indicator and mapping tool for extreme metamorphism worldwide. Our latest work involving Ph.D. student Duncan Keller has turned up some surprises. His study of &ldquo;silica-undersaturated&rdquo; rocks (they lack quartz) in the field area reveals that not only were the rocks heated to extreme temperatures, they were buried to very great depths as well. The pressures the rocks were subjected to were about 1.7 GPa, which is about 17,000 times atmospheric pressure. Such pressures are only reached at great depths of about 60 km (nearly 40 miles) below the surface. These pressure-temperature estimates have been confirmed completely independently by our colleague Silvio Ferrero (GFZ, Potsdam, Germany) who did experiments on inclusions of melt trapped within garnets. So the rocks are the hottest and the deepest yet discovered in the New England Appalachians; technically they are best termed &ldquo;high-pressure granulites&rdquo;. Our working hypothesis is that the rocks were underthrust and potentially subducted beneath overriding continental crust during the Devonian Period as part of the sequence of plate tectonic collisions that gave rise to Pangaea.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The project provided partial or full support for Ph.D. students Jennifer Axler, Duncan Keller, and Xu Chu, twenty papers and conference presentations (several more are in preparation), and a book chapter.
