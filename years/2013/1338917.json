 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests Phase III funding for the University of Virginia (UVA) to remain as an active lead site in the Center for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing (LPAM).\r\n \r\nThe primary focus of the center's research is in laser and plasma applications for advanced manufacturing. With the advances in laser and plasma technology such as availability of high power diode, solid state and fiber lasers, and atmospheric plasma sources, there is continued growth of laser and plasma applications for industrial manufacturing. Lasers allow non-contact material processing to provide high precision, faster throughput and applicability to variety of materials such as metals, ceramics, polymers and composites. Some of the centers research activities have been in the areas of laser removal of oxides, laser micromachining of titanium, laser micro-texturing, optical imaging sensors for laser welding, micromachining of aluminum alloys, atmospheric plasma treatment of polymeric surfaces etc. Lasers and plasma sources continue to play an important role in various industrial sectors such as energy (specifically solar energy), automobile, aerospace, microelectronics, biomedical and general manufacturing. The center will continue to support industry research through innovation, participation of graduate and undergraduate students, leveraging the existing facilities and through multi-university partnerships. \r\n\r\nThe performance of industry research by lead center and various sites, allows the U.S. industry to be more competitive in advanced manufacturing and hence the LPAM center provides a great economic benefit to the society. The LPAM center develops new manufacturing processes and process monitoring tools, as well as provides fundamental understanding of technical issues related to current processes for the benefit of the center industrial members. The LPAM center also provides education and training to graduate and undergraduate student in research areas of interest to industry to meet their future workforce needs. The LPAM center creates a unique opportunity for students to be able to collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers. The LPAM center provides opportunities for team building and carrying out research in collaboration with students at participating universities and industrial members. The center has also involved undergraduate students through Research Experience for Undergraduates program and has provided a valuable experience at early stage of student's career.",
