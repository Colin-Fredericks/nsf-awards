 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will use rigorous asymptotic analysis to answer open questions concerning the following three aspects of integrable nonlinear wave equations: (A) The asymptotic behavior of initial value problems for multicomponent integrable systems in one spatial and one temporal variable, including the n-wave model and the Markov n-wave model for Burgers turbulence. (B) Understanding and classifying critical behavior in boundary regions in systems such as the semiclassical sine-Gordon and long-time nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and uncovering fundamental properties of associated Painleve functions. (C) Asymptotic analysis of models in two spatial and one temporal variables, such as the Davey-Stewartson II and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equations, requiring the d-bar approach to inverse scattering.  These three projects will make use of and further develop recent advances in asymptotic analysis, scattering theory, and the study of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices.\r\n\r\nNonlinear wave equations are powerful mathematical models for energy transmission in fluid dynamics, solid state physics, and other physical systems. Specific applications of the models considered include the evolution of cosmological structures, the onset of wave collapse in fiber-optic cables and superconducting Josephson junctions, the accumulation of fluid vortices, and Hele-Shaw flow.  Solutions to these equations are typically too complex to describe in full generality, yet salient features often become clear in certain asymptotic limits for entire families of initial conditions. This universality is an indication of the reasonableness of the equation as a good physical model. Incorporating the effect of interaction terms in multicomponent systems, analyzing critical transitions to help completely describe global behavior, and developing the mathematical tools necessary to study systems in two spatial dimensions will help build a fuller picture of the behavior of general nonlinear wave equations and their applicability as physical models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNonlinear wave equations are powerful mathematical models for energy transmission with applications ranging from water waves to fiber optics.  The completed project further developed our understanding of three important aspects of nonlinear wave theory:  multicomponent systems, critical phenomena at boundary regions, and the development of new mathematical techniques.  Due to the variety of physical applications, the results obtained help to provide a solid mathematical background for future scientific and engineering advances.  The project also provided significant opportunities for professional development for junior mathematicians through collaboration as well as conference and special session organization.\n\nMulticomponent systems. \n\nMost theory for wave propagation has been developed for scalar equations.  However, multicomponent systems display new interesting physical phenomena and can provide more accurate models.  The three-wave resonant interaction equations are one of the most fundamental multicomponent systems.  In joint work with R. Jenkins and P. Miller, we have initiated the first investigation of the semiclassical behavior of these equations.  Analytical and numerical results show, for the first time, multiphase behavior similar to dispersive shock waves in scalar systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and provide a basis for ongoing asymptotic analysis.  Applications of the three-wave resonant interaction equations include atmospheric Rossby waves, the design of all-optical switches, and buckling of cylindrical shells.\n\nCritical phenomena at boundary regions. \n\nIn many situations olutions of nonlinear wave equations display qualitatively different behavior in different regions (such as oscillations versus a smooth profile).  The transition between these regions has been an active research area recently, with Painleve functions playing a leading role.  The transition between a rotational region and a librational region in the semiclassical sine-Gordon equation is known to be described in terms of rational solutions of the second Painleve equation.  Jointly with P. Miller we have analyzed the large-degree asymptotic behavior of these rational solutions in both the edge and the bulk of the pole region, results that are necessary for understanding the rotational-librational transition.  These results also proved a conjecture from 1986 by Kametaka, Noda, Fukui, and Hiranoin concerning the regular structure of the zeros and poles.  The semiclassical sine-Gordon equation models magnetic flux propagation in superconducing Josephson junctions, while the rational Painleve functions have further applications to water vortices.\n\nDevelopment of new mathematical techniques. \n\nRemarkable progress in the study of integrable equations has been made through the development of the nonlinear steepest-descent method and the analysis of Riemann-HIlbert problems.  These methods have, in turn, led to advances in probability, orthogonal polynomials, and other fields.  In joint work with M. Bertola, S. Lee, and V. Pierce, we have used the nonlinear steepest-descent method to determine the small-rank perturbation behavior in the external source random matrix model.  This analysis required extending the theory of 3x3 Riemann-Hilbert problems (most prior work is for the 2x2 case).  Further progress in the study of nonlinear wave equations will be facilitated by the  development of these methods.  For example, a different 3x3 Riemann-Hilbert problem arises in the study of the three-wave resonant interaction equations.\n\nSupport for professional development.\n\nIn addition to furthering the mathematical understanding of the physical processes described by these equations, the project supported training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in nonlinear wave theory.  Three postdoctoral researchers collaborated on projects.  Furthermore, during the project time period, the PI co-organized three special sessions on nonlinear equations and related topics at professional meetings (the 2016 SIAM Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures, the 2015 IMACS International Conference on Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena, and the 2014 AMS Spring Southeastern Section Meeting) and the 77th Midwest PDE Seminar in April, 2016, which featured a combined ten talks by graduate students and nine by postdoctoral researchers.  A further seventeen graduate students and four postdocs participated in the Midwest PDE Seminar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Buckingham"
