 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streamline to Mastery Phase II builds on the collective induction philosophy that undergirds successful NSF-funded Noyce programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.  The project is integrating, expanding, and aligning teacher preparation, induction, and leadership by bringing together Noyce Teacher Teams of teachers and prospective teachers with different levels of experience.  The focus of each team of veteran, novice, and prospective teachers is on conducting classroom research and the goal of this centralizing activity is the critical examination of assumptions about teaching and learning. The mechanism by which such reflection occurs is scientific inquiry into one's own practice, the practices of others, and the practices of students. This design is like that of any scientific laboratory-knowledge generation with all participants playing critical, productive roles as knowledge producers as well as expert learners. The project is a collaboration of the University of Colorado Boulder,  Adams 12 5-Star Schools, Boulder Valley, Cherry Creek, Denver Public Schools, Englewood, Jefferson County, Mapleton, and St. Vrain Valley school districts and includes Colorado Legacy Foundation as a partner. The design of this project reaches beyond general descriptions of teaching practice such as \"inquiry-based\" and \"student-centered\" and into the realm of fundamental reorganization of learning contexts for teachers. The Streamline to Mastery Phase II research team activities serve as mechanisms both for the professional growth of participants and as a model for how scientific inquiry into personally and professionally meaningful problems leads to collective knowledge generation. \r\n\r\nThis project has the potential to impact thousands of students as well as to instigate large-scale change in the way teacher preparation, novice teacher induction, and veteran teacher professional development are conducted. The proposed Teacher Research Team model is potentially sustainable and builds on, rather than questions, the abilities and wisdom of people who devote their lives to teaching. This philosophy transcends into K-12 classrooms, where the skills and experiences of students can be utilized rather than questioned. The model proposed and tested in this project is based on equity and access, guided by the understanding that people will learn in contexts that capitalize on their social, linguistic, experiential, and cognitive resources. The project immediately impacts over 40 teachers, including 10 new Master Teaching Fellows, and their students in high-needs school districts in Colorado. The expectation that Noyce Teacher Teams publish and present their work, and engage other teachers in professional development activities leads to a greater impact on teachers and their students nationwide",

By the end of the grant, the Streamline to Mastery teacher community had built two programs that will survive beyond the life of the grant. Both programs are headed by K-12 teachers, and they serve K-12 teachers. Over the life of the grant, the 11 teachers worked with over 200 teachers from 70+ schools, impacting over 25,000 students. The first program is called the Noyce Induction Teacher (NIT) program, which brings together practicing teachers with prospective teachers in discussing problems of practices and working together toward solutions. The group also engages in a book study each year and in lesson design that brings together content and culturally and linguistically responsive teaching. Prospective teachers reported increases in their understanding of the reality of teaching, in their confidence and general know-how, and in their feelings of community and relationships. Practicing teachers reported improved support networks, improved self-care and relationships, and confidence. The program is in the process of being integrated into the standard teacher certification program at the host institution. Four of the teachers from the original cohort of 11 teachers published a book highlighting their leadership experiences in this program and how it has impacted them as influential professionals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second program is a curriculum-focused, professional learning program that brings Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to life in the high school physics classroom. Physics through Evidence, Empowerment through Reasoning (PEER Physics) engages teachers first in a community to enact the NGSS in their classrooms using PEER Physics materials. After two years of implementation, teachers are eligible to enter facilitator training and can become compensated facilitators of PEER Physics professional learning for other teachers. Research demonstrated that for each session a teacher attended, they showed a 1.5% increase in the learning outcomes of their students. Research also showed that students in PEER Physics courses learned more than students in more traditional courses, and that students felt empowered through the process of supporting claims with evidence in the classroom. Teachers also reported feeling a sense of empowerment through the leadership they developed through participation in the program. One student said, <em>We used to be gullible before this class, but now evidence has our backs.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Another said, <em>If she had just told us the answer, I think you lose that sense of wonder, so it kind of taught me to be more resourceful of myself and not always depending on other sources.</em>&nbsp;A PEER Physics teachers said, <span><em>I really appreciate that there was not one wasted moment during our work together. This was engaging and worthwhile - all the work and learning that we did was obviously worthwhile, practical, and well thought out and presented.&nbsp;</em>Another teacher said, <span><em>I want to try inviting students to constantly refer back to the evidence...This is new for me, as I often struggle with equalizing the playing field and knowing how to engage students on both extremes of the spectrum of understanding.
