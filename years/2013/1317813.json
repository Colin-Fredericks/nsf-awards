 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a new approach to robot learning from demonstration which allows experimenters to teach multiple robots nontrivial, heterogenous collective behaviors in real-time.  Training multiple robots is challenging because while the experimenter may know what emergent collective behavior he wishes to achieve, it is unlikely that he knows what individual robot behaviors, and their interactions, will achieve it. This project decomposes robot teams or swarms into a social hierarchy of leaders and subordinates.  Small groups are then trained at the bottom of the hierarchy relatively simple collective behaviors, then groups of leaders are trained progressively with more complex and abstract behaviors, until all trained top-level root behaviors have been learned. The project examines homogeneous behaviors within robot groups, heterogeneous behaviors among the robots, and mixtures of the two at any level in the hierarchy.  The method builds on prior work in single-robot behavior training, which used decomposed hierarchies of behaviors consisting of finite-state automata and learned transition functions. Beyond robotics, the project also allows the development of group behaviors for virtual agents found in animation and in emerging agent-based models in the social sciences and biology.  The work integrates with a teaching and research robotics laboratory, with agent-based modelers in the social sciences, and with robotics education efforts in K-12 underprivileged schools.",

The goal of this project is to develop a way by which a single non-expert human can train a large swarm of agents (robots, etc.) to do complex collective tasks, in real time: perhaps an hour or two.  To this end we developed HiTAB, a piece of software which makes it possible for anyone to train a team or swarm of agents.  Using HiTAB, for example, we taught a team of humanoid robots how to play soccer at the RoboCup competition, then entered the result into the competition, defeating many competitors.\n\nThe project has also assisted the development of multiagent systems research in other areas closely related to or directly supporting multiagent training.  We developed a small swarm of 25-30 robots, the New FlockBots, which can collectively manipulate their environment and work together to do tasks such as collaborative construction.  We also developed approaches by which robots such as the New Flockbots can leave virtual messages in the environment (inspired by pheromones) to communicate with other robots so as to coordinate their behaviors.  This is useful because with large numbers of robots, or robots spread over large areas, wireless communication etc. is no longer reliable.  Furthermore, we developed so-called \"lenient learning\" algorithms by which robots can rapidly understand how to work together to maximize the payoff of the group without having to know exactly what the other robots are doing at any particular time.  And we have developed new approaches to distributing tasks among robots based loosely on how bounty hunters compete to maximize their bounty payoff.  This approach has outperformed traditional methods, usually based on auctions.\n\nThe work we've done has also resulted in large and sophisticated pieces of open-source software and hardware made available to other researchers and the general public.  Our HiTAB software is open source, as is the New FlockBots hardware and software library.  These systems build on top of MASON, our widely regarded multiagent simulation toolkit, and ECJ, our generally regarded first-in-class evolutionary computation library, both open source and in widespread use in their respective areas.
