 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to acquire a state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) system for a range of metabolomics and proteomics applications. Mass spectrometry has emerged as the technology of choice for workflows seeking to identify, detect, and/or quantify metabolites and \r\nother small molecules as well as proteins and peptides in complex biological samples. The instrument specific benefits include: very fast full-scan acquisition speed, large dynamic range, high resolution,superior sensitivity, and mass accuracy. The proposed QTOF system will support a diverse range of research projects for the PIs as well as a number of major users and collaborators: (1) identifying immunomodulatory microbiota metabolites; (2) in vitro disease model; (3) cardiac tissue engineering and regenerative medicine; (4) lipidoids for nucleic acid delivery; (5)biosynthesis of advanced biofuels; (6) non-invasive monitoring of tissue metabolism;and (7)tendon development and regeneration.",
