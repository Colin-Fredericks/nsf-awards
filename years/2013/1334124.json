 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI requests funding to develop and implement a novel forward scatter reciprocal acoustic scintillation instrument to measure path-averaged hydrothermal vent flow (horizontal and vertical), and temperature along the acoustic path (mean and turbulence properties). The instrument will be capable of reciprocal transmission and reception of acoustic signals from two pairs of transceivers at two depths to measure the mean and turbulent properties of the horizontal flow and sound speed (temperature) along the acoustic path. In particular, the measurement of temperature by reciprocal acoustic paths will provide a direct measure of heat flux issuing from the vents and quantify the effect of suspended particles and turbulence on their measurements.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   \r\n\r\nHydrothermal vents are scientifically interesting. Hydrothermal vents also appeal to the broader public and hence can serve as a valuable vehicle to attract high school and undergraduate students to STEM activities. The PI has already demonstrated evidence that she has been able to involve high school teachers and students in her activities.",

The acoustic propagation instrument sends coded or uncoded transmissions from the Master to the Slave unit and vice versa and sound is scattered from a deep-sea hydrothermal plume like that of the Grotto vent at the Main Endeavour vent field.  Unlike other sampling instruments, this acoustic scintillation instrument allows remote measurement of hydrothermal physical properties without having any sensors in the plume waters which are highly corrosive and particle laden.  Its design is intended to give accurate amplitude and time of arrival (hence phase) measurements for four channels (two pairs of two transmitters and two receivers vertically spaced 5 m apart) at sampling rates up to 12 Hz.  This data will be collected in real time on the land base station and processed to give measurements of the vertical rise speed and turbulent mixing as a result of entrainment of ambient fluids, and document their changes at two depths and as a function of oceanographic and geological events over the long term.  The instrument is specifically designed for maximum flexibility, given its intended long term 5 year deployment plan on the cabled observatory.\n\nCORAS is designed for remote operation as part of the Ocean Networks Canada Northeast Pacific Ocean cabled observatory at the main Endeavour vent field.  It is equipped with titanium pressure housings for the depth and corrosive environment in which it will be deployed and is designed to be deployed and connected to the observatory by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) using specialized underwater mateable connectors.  The transducers in the arrays are specially designed and built to be horizontally omnidirectional with a narrow vertical beamwidth, so that there is no need to aim them when they are positioned on either side of the hydrothermal plume (see attached image).
