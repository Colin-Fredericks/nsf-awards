 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID) will help identify how experts and non-experts reassess storm surge flood risks that affect small municipalities following a record-setting disaster.  It is informed by, and will contribute to, the interdisciplinary research literature on disaster recovery and risk governance.  Experts in emergency management organizations and flood plain management organizations will be surveyed electronically to establish the scope of risk information needs in the wake of Sandy, risk information exchange activities, risk information gaps and unmet needs among user groups, openness to involvement by non-experts, and suggestions about ways that risk information could be employed more effectively. Public leaders and risk professionals in each of three small municipalities that sustained losses will also be interviewed to assess their roles in demanding, supplying, receiving, and using risk information pertinent to their communities.  Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with local residents who have decided to continue living in these communities after the storm. Interviews will identify residents' activities as suppliers of local knowledge about post-storm risks, their assessments of other flood risk information, and the perceived importance of risk information in reducing uncertainties about recovery and community futures. Cross-tabulations and content analysis of the data collected in surveys and interviews will be undertaken to reveal shared concerns and assumptions about future flood risks as well as to uncover the structure of evolving new networks that blend inputs from external experts and local residents.\r\n \r\nThe grant will provide information necessary to improve preparedness for coastal flood risks that are anticipated to increase as a consequence of climate change. Progress in anticipating more floods is being made at the global, transnational and national scales but little is known about how small municipalities are equipped for that urgent task. Small independent municipalities with limited resources and populations of less than 10,000 are the norm for much of coastal America. These are the places that most need, and can benefit from, decision-support information.  The survival of small municipalities and the wellbeing of adjacent coasts will depend in large part on their ability to take advantage of expert information in the aftermath of disasters that wreak major damage. At such times prompt but judicious decisions are required about future uses of the damaged and vulnerable areas that will increase their long-term resilience. What happens in the small municipalities will determine the success of broader regional and national responses to rising sea levels and worsening storms. By supplying a sign-posted road map to the ways that risk information is being used and pointing out opportunities for improvements, this research will make a valuable contribution to human welfare, economic recovery and environmental sustainability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was initiated when it became clear that the unprecedented losses suffered as a result of Super Storm Sandy (October 2012) would prompt major decisions about recovery that would likely shape long-term patterns of vulnerability and resilience.  In the past it has proven very difficult to get individuals and communities in the United States to employ the best available scientific and technical information that is capable of reducing future losses.  A rush to rebuild, with only limited concern for improving protection against future storms, has been a distinguishing feature of past coastal disasters.  Constructive changes to policy most often occur only in the wake of a catastrophic event.  Sandy provided an opportunity to study risk decision-making in response to a powerful stimulus for change in small under-resourced municipalities that are typical of most U.S. coasts.\n\nIt was found that post-disaster rebuilding and recovery decisions of individuals and communities in three case study communities were hampered by a large number of uncertainties about the process of recovery and by confusion about the meaning of new flood risk information that was released by federal agencies in the wake of the storm.  Non-expert local residents of disaster impacted communities employed systems of storm surge risk assessment that took into account a wide range of flood-forcing factors, that are recognized by research scientists but are not included in the flood risk maps and base flood elevation data that inform the most important rebuilding and redevelopment regulations in disaster-affected coastal communities.  Whereas these instruments focus mainly on predicted flood depths, laypersons also attribute powerful agency to wave action, sediment transport, drainage, sand dunes, and the effects of nearby structures, among others.  The differing perspectives of experts and laypersons raise problems of reconciling official and vernacular risk assessment which undercut support for the former, as well as calling into question strong official reliance on narrowly defined flood risk criteria.  At the scale of individual sites and property lots the panorama of large areas at risk to flooding that is portrayed in Flood Insurance Rate Maps, breaks up into a mosaic of distinctive local places, each with its own hazard characteristics.\n\nFEMA (The Federal Emergency Management Agency) injected new flood risk maps and base flood elevation data into recovery and redevelopment decisions making at a time when a large number of other uncertainties about recovery monopolized the attention of victims and hampered their efforts.  The project identified more than thirty such barriers to decision-making, many present simultaneously in the time window when officials who sought local input were negotiating rebuilding choices.  Efforts to lower or remove these barriers are likely to leave communities better equipped to face future hazards.\n\nInstitutional mismatches between local and regional governance units on the one hand and federal policy on the other, frustrated the achievement of holistic disaster recovery in the case study communities.  Whereas recovery of buildings and infrastructure was well accommodated by existing institutions, the tasks of achieving sustainability-enhancing objectives of economic, environmental, social and cultural recovery were seriously impeded\n\nThe project\u00c6s chief intellectual impact is on theories and models in the interdisciplinary field of Hazards and Disasters Research, that relate to the production, exchange and use of specialized information about risk. Our findings challenge the assumption that increasing complexity of disasters retards the widespread participation in decision-making of laypeople by revealing the depth and multidimensionality of lay risk assessments. They also supply a basis for sharpening official flood risk analysis methods by making them more sensitive to local scale variations that presently escape con..."
