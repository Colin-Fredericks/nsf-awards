 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe PIs propose a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of establishing the structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using oxygen isotopes in benthic foraminifera. While such measurements are plentiful north of the ACC, there is only one published LGM benthic oxygen isotope measurement south of the ACC. The PIs will analyze a series of sediment cores south of the ACC to determine if they can identify cores with the appropriate stratigraphy and sufficient benthic foraminifera to establish a profile of LGM benthic oxygen isotopes. They will also investigate the possibility of reconstructing the LGM density contrast across the ACC based on existing data and dynamical constraints. The outcomes of this work could provide strong constraints on both the dynamical and biogeochemical behavior of the ACC, an important component of the ocean-atmosphere system.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThis work could help fill a gap in current dynamical understanding of the interactions between atmospheric winds, ocean eddies and the density structure, which is an area of active research in the climate dynamics community. The PIs will provide research experience for an undergraduate student from an under-represented group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded a pilot study in order to investigate the feasibility of establishing the structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during the Last Ice Age.  Large scale ocean flow is strongly coupled to the distribution of seawater density, and seawater density, in turn, is largely driven by seawater temperature and salinity.  Our approach was to combine various types of paleoclimate data to best estimate the distribution of seawater density and thus circulation in the Antarctic during the last ice age.  We first analyzed output from numerical models of the ocean/climate system and found that the strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is tightly linked to both the lateral density gradients across the current, but also to the vertical density gradient north of the current.  This allowed us to take advantage of the relatively large amount of information we have about the temperature and salinity of the ice age ocean in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans to make estimates about the Antarctic circulation despite the lack of data in the Antarctic region itself.  Our reconstruction suggests that there may have been some strengthening of Antarctic Circumpolar Current, it was likely more modest than in some model studies.  We also find that better reconstructions temperature and salinity at intermediate depths (Antarctic Intermediate Waters) would significantly reduce the errors on these estimates.\n\nThis work will be of interest to those seeking to understand why atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations decrease during ice ages.
