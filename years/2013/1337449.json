 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Ernest Petersson from the University of Pennsylvania and colleague Tobias Baumgart will acquire an autosampling stopped-flow spectrometer for users at U Penn, Drexel University, Temple University, Thomas Jefferson University and Swarthmore College. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of thioamide quenching probes; (b) study of protein/membrane interactions; (c) investigation of assembly kinetics of synergistic protein-nanoparticle assemblies; (d) small molecules to probe and control RNA tertiary structure; (e) determining the dynamics of programmed frame-shifting on the ribosome; (f) study of the folding mechanism of intrinsically disordered proteins; (g) enzymological studies of activation-induced deaminases; (h) studies to provide insight into class II tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA)-addition; (i) study of the mechanism of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase; and (j) mechanistic studies of cellulase enzymes.\r\n\r\nThe stop-flow system allows rapid mixing of samples allowing the acquisition of real time UV/visible absorbance and fluorescence data with millisecond time resolution for the study of chemical kinetics of molecules binding to proteins and nucleic acids or enzyme activities and simultaneously studies the changes in the spectra. In general, in a stopped flow spectrometer the enzymatic reaction is initiated by opening of valves followed by injection of the enzyme and substrate. The quantities mixed are controlled by the action of the enzyme, substrate, and stop syringe plungers. The mixed solution is irradiated at one wavelength through an excitation monochromator, and absorbance (one wavelength) and fluorescence (two wavelengths) outputs are simultaneously detected using separate filter channels. The data are then processed by a computer and fit to kinetic models specific to the reaction. The kinetic characterization of biomolecules enabled by stopped flow instrumentation is fundamental to understanding their function. Because most cellular processes take place far from equilibrium they are thus governed by the relative rates of enzymes. The instrumentation will be located in the Biological Chemistry Facility and will be used by a large number of researchers and students in various institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) acquired a KinTek AutoSF-120 autuosampling stopped-flow spectrometer for a shared instrumentation facility, known as the Biological Chemistry Resource Center (BCRC).  The BCRC houses several pieces of instrumentation used in the synthesis and analysis of biomolecules and is accessible to researchers across UPenn and at other institutions in the Philadelphia area.  To date, AutoSF-120 users have come from the UPenn School of Arts and Sciences, Perelman School of Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, and University of Delaware.  Additional users are anticipated from UPenn and the surrounding schools.  The KinTek AutoSF-120 enables one to rapidly measure the rates of enzyme reactions, biomolecule folding, or binding interactions.  Such data allow one to better understand the basic processes of proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids in in vitro experiments.  In many cases, this understanding can be extrapolated to provide fundamental insights to processes in cells or to the development of new therapeutic technologies.\n\nIntellectual Merits. The research projects executed with the AutoSF-120 each have specific individual merits, which variably derive from the impact of tool development and/or new fundamental understanding.  All experiments center on determining rates for molecules binding to proteins and nucleic acids, or enzyme activities.  The characterization of these rates enabled by stopped flow is crucial to understanding their function; most cellular processes take place far from equilibrium and are thus governed by the relative rates of enzymes.\n\nBroader Impacts. Learning to operate the AutoSF-120 and analyze data provides training that is applicable to careers in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries for students and postdoctoral scholars.  In addition to serving as a research and training tool, the AutoSF-120 has been used as part of the UPenn Summer Research Academy program to bring in cohorts of high school students to expose them to a high-level research environment, particularly in terms of Biochemistry experiments.\n\n \n\nUPenn BCRC: https://www.chem.upenn.edu/content/penn-chemistry-biological-chemistry-resource-center\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ernest J Petersson"
