 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of this project is to develop generative models for images of natural scenes, as well as associated algorithms for unsupervised learning of such models from natural images. The learned models can then be used for image representation and pattern recognition. A particular class of models investigated in this project are the compositional sparse coding models, where the images are represented by automatically learned dictionaries of templates, and each template is a compositional pattern of wavelets that provide sparse coding of the images. The PI and collaborators also investigate related models where the templates are inhomogeneous Markov random fields whose energy functions are defined by the sparse coding wavelets. \r\n \r\nImage understanding is at the hearts of many modern technologies. It is also a major function of human brains. The key to image understanding is automatic discovery of patterns in the images. The goal of this project is to develop methods for learning dictionaries of patterns or \"visual words\" for representing images of our environments. The learned dictionaries can be very useful for image understanding and object recognition.",

Such models represent our knowledge about the rich patterns in these signals, such as what a tiger looks like or what a flower looks like. They are probabilistic because they capture both the regularity and variability of the patterns. For example, we can sample from such a model to generate many different images of tigers. Such models enable the computers to learn from the data with little supervision. They can be used for pattern recognition, such as recognizing a tiger; pattern restoration, such as completing a partially occluded face; as well as computer graphics, such as generating photorealistic videos of flowing water.</p>\n<p>The attached images are generated by our probabilistic models learned from images of similar patterns. Intuitively, our models endow the computers with the gift of imagination, which is important for the computers to perform various tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One model we study in this project is a two-layer model, where the first layer consists of wavelets, and the second layer consists of their compositional patterns. Intuitively, the wavelets are like strokes, and their compositions are like the characters or words made up by the strokes.

In our work, we show that the filters or descriptors in ConvNet can also be used for probabilistic modeling, e.g., telling us what a cat looks like or what a tiger looks like.
