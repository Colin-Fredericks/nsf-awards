 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research asks what relationship extremist ideologies and militarization have to protracted displacement. This project has chosen a Chechen exile community in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan as the research site within which it will explore this question. The research comes in the wake of the violent acts committed by Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the \"Boston Marathon bombers,\" who were ethnic Chechens born and raised in Tokmok. There has been widespread speculation about their motivations that reflect the larger debate among social scientists about the root causes of extremism. This research explores the role of protracted displacement in ethnonationalism and potential extremism.\r\n\r\nMore than a million people from the Caucasus region displaced since 1944. Yet, little is known about how protracted displacement in the Caucasus is related to nationalism and extremist ideologies. This project investigates three hypotheses: (1) that displaced Chechens in Kyrgyzstan are socially isolated from the Kyrgyz and Russian communities; (2) that social isolation, unemployment and uncertainty resulting from dislocation lead to a pervasive sense of waiting, stasis and \"nothingness\" in the present rather than a sense of development and progress; and (3) that the experience of exile leads to a historical narrative that frames current dispossession and precarity in terms of future control over disputed territory. \r\n\r\nTo conduct the research, the PI will travel to Kyrgyzstan to accomplish four tasks: (1) interviewing the Chechen community about the history of forced migration and conditions of protracted displacement in Kyrgyzstan; (2) Conducting path analysis to determine how isolated the Chechen community is in Kyrgyzstan; (3) interviewing Chechens, particularly young men, about daily activities, including participation in street corner gatherings where young men discuss politics, religion, and violence. \r\n\r\nThis research will shed light on the experiences of the Chechen community, now seen as the major source of political conflict in the former USSR. More importantly, it will create a framework for understanding why forced displacement so often gives rise to violent political movements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhat is the link between forced displacement and political extremism?  We investigated this question by conducting research in the Chechen community in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan.  The Chechens of Tokmok were originally displaced by Stalin in 1944.  More recently, this  was the original community of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston  Marathon Bombers.  The project had three major research objectives:   (1) to discover whether or not displaced Chechens in Kyrgyzstan socially  isolated (2) to investigate whether social isolation, inactivity and  uncertainty resulting from dislocation gave this community a pervasive  sense of stasis rather than of progress, and  (3) whether protracted  displacement led to \"mythico-historical\" narratives that posited a  return to territorial control as the only responses to isolation and  stasis.   We spent three months in Tokmok conducting   ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured interviewing and archival research  to determine the answers to these questions.   In NKVD archives, we located documents relating to the way Chechens were treated upon arrival in Kyrgyzstan that explained why they became (and remained) socially and economically marginalized  in Kyrgyz society.  Through semi-structured interviews, we also learned the ways that this community became tied to organized crime in Kyrgyzstan.    Our research showed how and why this community has developed its own legal code, apart from state-sponsored law, and how it has come to rely on organized crime networks for many of the functions ordinarily provided by the nation-state, including the administration of justice and social service provision.  While we did not discover any links to radical Islamic movements, we did discover how and why many members of the community have resorted to violence and criminality to contend with pervasive socio-political marginalization.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth C Dunn"
