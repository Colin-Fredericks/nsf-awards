 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a high--?]throughput --?] surface acoustic wave nebulization (HTP--?]SAWN) ion source for mass spectrometry (MS). The SAWN ion source developed during phase I resulted in a device that has competitive performance between the two most popular ionization techniques for MS: electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix--?]assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). SAWN offers the convenience of ionization from a planar surface like MALDI, but the performance characteristics of ESI at atmospheric pressure (Heron et al. Anal. Chem. 2010). However, at the end of phase I SAWN remains low throughput and at an early developmental stage technologically. The phase II proposal will refine SAWN performance by coupling it to a novel MS interface that efficiently samples solvated analytes produced by SAWN making it immediately available on all major manufacturer?fs instruments. Phase II will result in an 1) optimized piezoelectric wafer by investigating options other than lithium niobate; 2) automated, robotic, HTP--?]SAWN that will double the throughput of an existing ESI--?]based assay; and 3) a more economical to manufacture and efficient to operate concentric ring interdigitated transducer electrode design developed in phase I. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will provide a high--?]throughput --?] surface acoustic wave nebulization (HTP--?]SAWN) ion source for mass spectrometry that offers ease of use; lower ion energetics and the capability to instantaneously monitor chemical reactions. SAWN has been shown by direct comparison to generate ions of lower energy (Huang et al. JASMS 2012; Yoon et al. Anal Chem 2012) than ESI and by inference MALDI. In addition to HTP--?]SAWN, phase II will result in SAWN being  compatible with all major manufacturer?fs instruments. SAWN will also be combined with direct analysis in real time (DART) to expand the capability of SAWN and DART; e.g. the combination will provide secondary ionization of compounds in emulsions desorbed from the SAWN chip into the DART stream. Additionally, dried blood spot analysis by HTP--?]SAWN will be developed using a newborn error assay for lysosomal storage disorders as an example. This assay will be used to demonstrate the potential of SAWN for immediate analysis of reaction products. SAWN has the broader potential for direct analysis any number of chemical or biochemical reactions within seconds of them having been carried out from monitoring cellular secretions or bacterial communication.",
