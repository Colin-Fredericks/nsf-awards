 "awd_abstract_narration": "1254484\r\nHuang\r\n\r\nCell properties have been extensively examined in two-dimensions (2D), yielding fruitful information\r\nregarding focal adhesions, migration, the establishment of polarity, traction forces and\r\nmechanotransductive responses. However, with few exceptions, most cells in vivo exist in a threedimensional\r\n(3D) environment, where their behavior is considerably different compared to when they are\r\nplated on a petri dish. Not only are there significant geometric differences, but there are also\r\nomnidirectional cell-cell interactions as well as cell-matrix interactions. As disease and tissue engineering\r\nresearch advance, it is imperative that cellular behavior and properties are established in detail. However,\r\nachieving this goal has been slow, in a large part because imaging and otherwise probing cells embedded\r\nwithin other cells and/or matrices is difficult due to scattering and inaccessibility. Thus there is a need for\r\ntransforming techniques to derive information from three-dimensional cellular constructs.\r\n\r\nThe scientific objectives of this proposal are (1) to design and implement a microrheometer to\r\ncharacterize cellular properties that can remove out-of-plane noise and perform three-dimensional\r\ntracking, (2) to use the microrheometer to assess changes in cell rheological properties under resting\r\nconditions as well as under mechanical stimuli, in a variety of 2D and 3D environments, and (3) to model\r\n2D and 3D rheological changes using a novel 9-parameter computational model based on a Monte Carlo\r\nsimulation which will be used to interpret the results from the experimental parts of the project.\r\nPreliminary work demonstrates that cell behavior in layered 2D arrangements are already more\r\ncomplex than simple 2D plating can predict. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness of new\r\ntechniques for acquiring microrheological measurements in a variety of conditions. The next logical step\r\nis to deploy more advanced techniques to 3D, and to carefully examine cell behavior and response in\r\nmore realistic environments, and to create computational models to help interpret the results. Thus, this\r\nproject will provide the groundwork for years of research in basic cell biomechanics, tissue engineering,\r\nas well as imaging techniques that may rely on these measurements for diagnoses or treatments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The driving goal of this project is to characterize cells in threedimensional\r\nenvironments by designing advanced imaging setups, coupled with computational\r\nmodels to help interpret the results. Because 3D is the next major area of cell-based research, and\r\nbecause tools for examining biomechanics and mechanotransduction are currently lacking for 3D\r\nexperimentation, the work proposed here will help advance the field of biomechanics, tissue engineering\r\nand imaging. Ultimately, a vastly improved and more realistic model of cell behavior in vivo will be\r\nestablished and better models of cell regulation and physiology can be created.\r\n\r\nThe overall merit of this work lies in the ability to precisely characterize cell properties under\r\nrealistic but controlled conditions, where one can vary the extracellular matrix constituents, the\r\nmechanical stresses acting on the cells, and the degree of cell-cell interactions. Thus, these results can be\r\ntransformative for the field of cell mechanics and mechanotransduction, which themselves are relevant for\r\na broad range of other fields. Because of the fast development of 3D tissue-engineered constructs and the\r\nneed for characterizing cell properties, this proposal seeks to fill a large gap in current knowledge. For\r\nexample, is it true that in response to mechanical stimuli, cells first fluidize their interior to permit\r\nremodeling? Do cells plated in 3D exhibit different anisotropy from cells plated in 2D? Does altering the\r\nadhesive ligand engaged by one layer of cells affect a second layer of cells plated on top of the first layer?\r\nThis proposal seeks to answer these, and other, questions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Because of the breadth of this project, there is considerable opportunity for\r\nhaving broader impacts on many aspects of biomedical engineering education and outreach. Because\r\nknowledge of contemporary biomedical engineering techniques and stem cell biology are not yet widely\r\navailable to educational programs and the public at large, part of this project is dedicated to outreach.\r\nThis outreach program is based on expanding a remote lab program by creating freely available videos\r\nalong the line of the \"Minute Physics\" videos, but with a focus on biomedical engineering topics and\r\ntechniques, posted to YouTube and other high-traffic video sites. Additionally, a broader selection of\r\nundergraduate students will be provided the opportunities to engage in laboratory research. Finally,\r\ncourses in tissue and molecular engineering and biomechanics will be enhanced by the topics explored in\r\nthis proposal, with plans for supplementary material stemming from a textbook that is currently in press.",
