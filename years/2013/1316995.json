 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Patricia Yang of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Lab of Marine Resources Management in National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.  The project title is \"Aero-Hydrodynamics of Flying Fish.\" The host scientist is Dr. Shui-Kai Chang.\r\n\r\nFlying fish perform specialized kinematics and fin morphing in order to rapidly transition from swimming underwater to gliding in air.  The project is to elucidate the novel mechanisms used by flying fish to propel themselves efficiently and stably in both air and water.  A series of experimental fluid dynamic studies are being conducted on larval flying fish raised in the laboratory.  This study provides original data on kinematics, morphology, and surface wetting properties of the body and appendages that facilitate propulsion on both sides of the air-water interface.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow's work will be disseminated through publication in journals and Popular Mechanics and other widely read magazines.  The Fellow will organize a conservation group for flying fish to increase understanding of both the fluid mechanics involved in locomotion, and the effect of human behavior on sustainability of flying fish in the wild.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFlying fish can propel themselves efficiently and stably in air and water.  Transition from swimming to gliding requires crossing two very different mediums, air and water, while water is 1000 times denser than air.  Juvenile flying fish less than 5 cm in length need to break \"surface tension barrier\" from water to air.  In this experimental and theoretical study, we use high-speed videography to characterize the kinematics of juvenile flying fish as they leap from the water surface.  Juvenile flying fish swim at 0.2 m/s near the interface in normal and leap after stimulation.  During this process, which lasts 0.05 seconds, flying fish achieve gliding speed to 1.2 m/s, an order of magnitude higher than swimming speed, by increasing tail-beat amplitude.  For juvenile flying fish less than 1 cm in length, the surface tension force is in the same magnitude of the maximum swimming force from fish, resulting failure leaping.  We rationalize the acceleration on the basis of hydrodynamic forces, surface tension and toques experience by the fish.  Specifically, leaping fish experience gravity only on the floating part of their body, permitting them to scheme much higher speeds than in steady swimming, and torque to decrease the body angle for further flight distance.  \n\nWe present the preliminary result in American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics Annual Meeting in Pittsburgh in November 2013.  The work will be present in Annual Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Conference in Austin in January 2014.\n\nOur work is in Buzz Blog to general audience:\n\nhttp://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=8309830695249701131\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patricia Yang"
