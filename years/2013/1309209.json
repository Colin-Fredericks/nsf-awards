 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to develop a practical quantum measurement technology - attosecond-resolution quantum interferometry. The need for the highest possible resolution in optical interferometric measurements is increasing with modern trends in fiber sensing, optical device characterization, optical identification of folded-unfolded and engaged protein markers, biological imaging of tissue and brain, and in hundreds of other science and technology applications. The approach is based on the utilization of polarization- and frequency-entangled states of light accompanied by the non-classical effect of dispersion cancellation. This use of several mutually entangled variables (hyper-entanglement) will boost the resolution of numerous sensing applications. The goal is the development of quantum interferometry for group velocity delay evaluation that has two orders of magnitude better resolution than the best classical optical apparatus could achieve. \r\nIntellectual merit.  The availability of quantum interferometry with attosecond resolution will be capable of revolutionizing optical measurement and sensing in multiple areas from telecommunication to biology.  The project must go significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art, and will rely on an interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of quantum optics, material science, and optical measurement. \r\nBroader impacts.  Novel scientific devices as well as environmental and biophotonics sensors always strive for greater resolution in order to reveal effects that are currently hidden from modern optical sensors. Quantum optics and quantum measurement are highly potent modern research fields, and the current project holds promise for attracting talented undergraduate and high-school students who are eager to join the development of future technological breakthroughs.",
