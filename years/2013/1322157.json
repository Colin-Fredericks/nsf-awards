FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. Topics include reliability, performance, mobility, power management, measurement, and other areas germane to file and storage systems. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work.",
