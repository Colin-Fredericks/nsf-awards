Among the topics to be discussed by speakers at this year's meeting are the following: classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and the Novikov conjecture; rigidity and deformation theory; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
