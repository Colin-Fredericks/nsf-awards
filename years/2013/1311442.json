 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through an integrative study of DNA sequences and morphological features, including the use of high-resolution computer tomography, we will study the adaptations to terrestrial and arboreal lifestyles in a large group of amphibians - the worldwide-distributed narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae).  Microhylids are not entirely restricted to the water for breeding, and many groups have completely abandoned the need of water for reproduction. Examination of anatomical adaptations related to this transition (aquatic to terrestrial breeding) in these frogs can help us understand the evolution of terrestriality in vertebrates as a whole.\r\n\r\nResults and data associated with this research will be broadly disseminated for both the scientific community and general public through a variety of outlets (scientific journals, newspapers, internet). Curriculum material will be developed together with the Department of Education the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) as part of the Science Research Mentoring and the Research Experience for Undergrads program at the AMNH, introducing high school and undergrad students to moderns research topics and techniques.",
