The instrument will be used to investigate the effects of high temperature and high energy proton irradiation on Wide Band Gap (WBG) semiconductor surface based device characteristics. This instrument will enable the researchers to develop an advanced metallization scheme that minimizes surface deformation because of the harsh environment. Wide band gap semiconductors are capable of surviving in harsh environments because of their intrinsic properties. In principle, WBG semiconductor based devices can operate in environments such as: (a) inside or in close proximity to an automotive engine block (for efficient fuel usage and reduced atmospheric pollution due to incomplete gas combustion); (b) the control electronics for nuclear power plants; (c) the sensor electronics for space exploration and  more. The goal is to investigate and explore conducting ternary refractory barrier layer to minimize damages to contact metal and semiconductor surface in high temperatures (between 500 and 800 degree centigrade) and high energy proton irradiations over a long exposure time.  The equipment will be the first electron microscope at ECSU. It will therefore serve as a great educational tool for underrepresented and underserved STEM students. It will also be an important outreach tool to K-12 science teachers and students in the northeastern North Carolina region.\r\n*****\r\nNon Technocal\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) with the acquisition of Portable Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector.  The SEM and EDS system will be used to investigate the effects of high temperature and high energy proton irradiation on Wide Band Gap (WBG) semiconductor surface based device characteristics. This instrument is essential to be able to understand and develop a durable and robust metallization scheme for materials and devices in harsh environmental conditions. Such condition exists in defense and weapons systems and in automobile industries for in-situ monitoring of gas combustion and control of environmental pollutant from incomplete gas combustion. Many faculty members across disciplines from technology to biology will be using the electron microscope for research and education. It is expected that more than 50 undergraduate students will make use of the equipment on a short-term basis per year. About 5 undergraduate students and 3 graduate students will routinely use the equipment for research per year. Teachers from the K-12 public schools in the region will be trained and aided to use the equipment to educate and motivate their students for a career in STEM disciplines. Samples will be viewed with SEM to introduce students to sub-micron length scale, structures and patterns that are not visible with common light microscope. SEM with EDS at ECSU will enable increased intra-university and interdisciplinary research collaboration between faculty members. It will also enable stronger collaboration with the center for materials research at Norfolk State University and the Applied Research Center at Newport News, Virginia where faculty may use more expensive SEM/TEM for detailed studies.",
