 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Christine Hughey and Stephen Lucas and their groups will explore the fundamentals of negative ion electrospray ionization, an ionization technique that selectively charges acidic molecules by deprotonation prior to mass spectrometric detection. Specifically, the researchers will investigate the mechanisms of ionization under different pH regimes and develop a multivariate model that will predict response for physiochemically diverse acidic analytes under different solution/pH conditions. In pursuit of these objectives, the team will test the hypothesis that analyte physiochemical properties have a greater impact on ionization efficiency than the route of ion formation. Since James Madison University is a predominately undergraduate institution (PUI), undergraduate chemistry and mathematics majors will conduct the research proposed and, in doing so, will learn how to effectively collaborate and communicate across disciplines. In addition, Professors Hughey and Lucas have a demonstrated track record with the involvement of women and the deaf in their research. The groups will continue to be an integral part of the research project.",
