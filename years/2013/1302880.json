 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio State University will host a conference entitled 'Hodge Theory and Classical Algebraic Geometry' on May 13--15, 2013.  The conference will cover Hodge theory, classical algebraic geometry and the interactions between them.  The principal topics will include abelian varieties, higher dimensional algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry.  Speakers will address recent progress in approaches to the Hodge conjecture, compactifications of period domains, variations of Hodge structures, algebraicity of Hodge class loci, and normal functions.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are (1) to generate new ideas and collaborations, (2) to formulate and disseminate new problems and directions of research, (3) to involve a new generation of researchers in these subjects.  This will be the first event in the U.S. devoted to the progress that has been made in Hodge theory over the past five years, as well as to the applications that it has in other parts of algebraic geometry.  One of the central problems in this area is to resolve the Hodge conjecture; this is one of the Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics Institute.
