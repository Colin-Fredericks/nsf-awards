 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the field of judgment and decision making, two distinct approaches have defined the debate over how people combine available information to form judgments: linear models and heuristic models. Since linear models excel at explaining judgment in some environments, and heuristic accounts are more effective in other environments, many researchers have argued that people switch between the different strategies depending on the particulars of the judgment task. In this research, the PI develops and tests a model of causal reasoning that subsumes both linear and heuristic models of judgments in a single, unified framework.  The PI will also test other implications of the model that previous models have been unable to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, this research has implications across a variety of fields. Medical diagnosis relies on doctors successfully assigning appropriate weights to cues (symptoms). Judges and juries are asked to combine cues (evidence) to make judgments of guilt and punishment. Investors look at cues such as various market conditions to decide on investment strategies. Understanding cue weighting has the potential improve the quality of important daily judgments.  Recognizing that judgments have significant consequences for decision-making in a variety of domains, this research will examine how to leverage findings to improve judgment in real-world areas of policy concern.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere is an awful lot of information in the world.  Some of it is useful; most of it is not.  How do people determine what information to use when making decisions, how to search for the information they need, and what do people do when different pieces of information conflict and suggest different conclusions? \n\nWe examined the extent to which causal relationships between pieces of information drive decisions about the importance of the information.  For example, imagine we are trying to predict the amount of water damage that was caused by a burst pipe, and we know a) the size of the hole and b) the amount of water that leaked.  While the size of the hole is predictive of the amount of damage (and thus might be a useful piece of information on its own) the reason it is predictive is that it gives insight into the amount of water leaked.  If we already know the amount of water leaked, then the size of the hole no longer provides valuable information.  Understanding the causal relationship between the size of the hole, the amount of water leaked, and the amount of damage gives insight into which pieces of information are most useful.\n\nOf course, this is a very simple example, but the basic principle should hold for more complex causal networks (with many, many pieces of information) as well. In this research, we found strong evidence of the primacy of causal relationships in determining how important cues are.\n\nThere are many areas that this could be useful.  Doctors need to diagnose diseases based on a number of symptoms and indicators, many of which are causally related.  Jurors need to determine guilt or innocence based on many pieces of evidence, which may be causal related.  Financial analysists need to predict the profitability of various investments based on a number of financial indicators, which are often causally related.  Better understanding how causal knowledge leads to cue weighting is broadly useful.\n\nOne area that it is particularly useful is in education.  Students are often assigned readings which contain both important, and tangential information.  One question we might ask is how well the students can distinguish what is important (which they should focus on and study) versus what is not (and which should receive less attention). \n\nOur studies have consistently shown that undergraduates are not very good at this task.  Students have a great deal of difficulty understanding what they should focus on.  We have found that, on average, undergraduates only realize that about a third of the important information is important (and thus neglect two thirds of the most important material)!  Moreover, we find that only about a third of the information that students think is important, actually is important (and thus two thirds of what students are studying is actually tangential).  \n\nMoreover, we find that students are no better at this task in their major than outside of their major, and most students do not improve much over their college careers.  When students are asked to report how they go about determining what is important, they very rarely identify the causal relationships between the information as a determining factor.  This suggests that our current research on causal relationships and importance judgments has the potential for notable improvements in the efficiency of education.  Even small improvements in how well students can identify the important material in a text could lead to large gains in how well the material is learned.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Oppenheimer"
