This symposium will bring together particle and nuclear physicists who share common interests in the study of multiparticle reactions at particle and nuclear physics colliders and will provide a forum for well-established physicists to interact with junior members in the field to work on solving the most complicated aspects of quantum chromodynamics. Participants will discuss recent experimental results, as well as new developments in theory that impact both communities. \r\n\r\nISDM 2013 represents a good opportunity for students and post-docs to further their training and advance their careers. These activities encourage research across discipline boundaries. The NSF support of this symposium will be used to support minorities, students or postdocs, who would be otherwise unable to cover travel expenses to the symposium, registration and local expenses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe XLIII International Symposium on Multiparticle Dynamics (ISMD 2013) was held at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, Illinois over September 15-20, 2013.  The Symposium was jointly organized by the IIT College of Science and the High Energy Physics Division of Argonne National Laboratory.  More than 100 participants from nearly 20 countries participated in the Symposium to review progress and discuss cross-cutting issues of multiparticle physics in the fields of high-energy physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics.\n\nAlong with general discussions of multiparticle phenomena, several new experimental results were presented from the LHC experiments at CERN, as well as from Fermilab's Tevatron, the HERA collider at DESY, Jefferson Lab, the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven, and the BaBar experiment at SLAC.  In addition, several talks covered recent progress in theoretical QCD calculations, including Monte Carlo simulations, attempts to model and control the underlying event, searches for exotic processes using boosted jet techniques, multiparticle correlations, diffractive physics, and searches beyond the Standard Model using multi-object final states.\n\nA primary theme that emerged from discussions at ISMD this year is the striking similarity between proton-proton collisions and heavy-ion collisions.  This similarity, which exhibits itself in the high detector-occupancy of proton-proton collision events, presents significant challenges for future high-precision physics.  A critical question for the next decade will be how to maintain energy resolution and reconstruction with a large contribution from multiple proton-proton interactions (pileup).  Many participants expressed their concern that continued access to low-PT jet physics is essential for the future of the field.\n\nThe success of ISMD was made possible by the outstanding contributions of several prominent female U.S. physicists who were able to help organize and attend the Symposium thanks to the generous aid of the National Science Foundation.  This project allowed Prof. Cynthia Keppel (Hampton University), Prof. Anna Stasto (Penn State University), Prof. Radja Boughezal (Northwestern University), Prof. Olga Evdokimov (University of Illinois, Chicago), and Dr. Sarka Todorova (Tufts University) to join fourteen other female physicists in organizing and presenting plenary talks or posters at the Symposium.
