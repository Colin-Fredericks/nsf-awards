 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop: \"Physical and Mathematical Principles of Brain Structure and Function\" will take place between May 5 and May 7, 2013 in Arlington, VA. Understanding how the human brain works has emerged as a major international focus of research in the coming decade, identified as such in President Obama's State of the Union Address in February 2013 and further developed in President Obama's BRAIN initiative announced on April 2, 2013. This workshop will bring together more than one hundred scientists to discuss how to enable major progress in understanding the brain, an important intellectual challenge of the 21st century. This conference of leading neuroscientists, mathematicians, physicists, materials scientists etc. will identify the specific intellectual challenges that can be met in the coming decades with focused effort. Panels of neuroscientists with expertise in different experimental approaches and model systems will identify important long-term goals that would transform their respective fields and drive progress across neuroscience. In addition, many important questions in neuroscience cannot be pursued with current tools. Bringing together neuroscientists and technologists will catalyze discussions that spur us towards transformative new scientific insights. Advances in systems neuroscience made by integrating existing technologies and devising new methods will provide an intellectual foundation. The workshop will also include many young scientists along with the established leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",

Behavior should be studied at high resolution, on multiple spatiotemporal scales and in ethologically natural, yet dynamically controllable settings. One goal is to develop large databases of context-specific behavioral reperotoires for various model organisms. Unsupervised machine vision and data mining methods will then hopefully reveal quantitative links between behaviors and their underlying neural circuits.\n\nAttendees agreed that research on \u00e6simple\u00c6 model systems should be encouraged under the BRAIN initiative, as these systems offer the unique opportunity to directly link brain activity and wiring diagrams to behavioral outputs, across a range of experimental paradigms. To study these systems more fully, we should encourage the development of methods that permit remote monitoring of animal behavior under naturalistic condi..."
