 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies Policy Roundtable of the Behavioral and Social Sciences is exploring ways in which the behavioral and social sciences can better inform and otherwise contribute to more effective and efficient government policies and programs.  Building upon the recent National Academies report, Using Science as Evidence in Public Policy, the Roundtable brings together those who make or advise on policy, those who conduct policy-relevant research, and those who fund research and data collection in order to provide the interaction necessary for the production of relevant research that policy makers can use.  The Roundtable informs policy makers of the relevance and utility of behavioral and social science research and engages researchers in formulating researchable questions that meet their needs.  The Roundtable also contributes to the development of research to better understand and advance the use of science to inform public policy and is a source of ideas for future National Academies workshops, conferences, and studies. \r\n\r\nRoundtable members discuss priority issues in the use of behavioral and social science research for public policy and engage in dialogue, share information, and suggest ideas for further exploration and further research.  A public workshop usually follows with presentations and discussions on identified topics that would further advance the use of science in public policy.  About three meetings of the Roundtable are to be held each year.  Brief summaries of the Roundtable discussions, or meeting recaps, are provided to members and a summary or proceedings of workshops is to be publicly available.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  For scientific research to continue to contribute to societal well-being, it is critical that decisions on public policies are informed by relevant scientific knowledge.  The creative dialogue within the Policy Roundtable and the presentations and discussions at its workshops will serve this important purpose.",
