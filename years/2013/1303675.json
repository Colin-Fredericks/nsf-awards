 "awd_abstract_narration": "The source of energetic electrons in the radiation belts during magnetic storms has long been and remains an unsolved problem in magnetospheric physics. In the most common model electrons are first accelerated in the near-Earth plasma sheet and these accelerated particles provide a ?seed? population for the radiation belts. Under this model the seed electrons undergo further acceleration in the radiation belts. Recently some studies have questioned whether or not this seed population is necessary. In this view the electrons are locally accelerated in the radiation belts. This proposal will investigate whether or not a seed population is necessary. The investigators will examine the phase space density of electrons as a function of radial distance by using observations from the THEMIS satellites, the Van Allen Probes, SWARM (an ESA mission) and e-POP (a Canadian mission). This will be a statistical study that uses a number of events.\r\n\r\nThe PI has long involved secondary school students in his research. His research projects for high school students have been very successful. He will continue this under this grant. The research findings from this proposal are important for space weather applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have examined one year?s worth of plasma observations from geosynchronous orbit for ion distributions that may simultaneously be subject to the Ion Bernstein (IB) instability (generating fast magnetosonic waves) and the Alfv&eacute;n cyclotron (AC) instability (generating electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves).  Confirming past analyses, ring/shell distributions with robust signatures of instability to fast magnetosonic waves are commonly found primarily on the dayside of the magnetosphere. We have developed a new approach to high-fidelity representation of the observed ring/shell distribution functions in a form readily suited to both analytical moments calculation and linear dispersion analysis, which allows statistical analysis of the ring/shell properties.  In our year's worth of observations, the ring/shell temperature anisotropy is found to have a clear upper limit that depends on the parallel beta of the ring/shell in a manner that is diagnostic of the operation of the AC instability (Figure 1).  This upper limit is only reached in the post-noon events, which are primarily produced by the energy- and pitch-angle dependent magnetic drifts of substorm-injected ions.  Further, it is primarily at the leading edge of such injections, where the distribution is strongly ring-like, that the AC instability appears to be operating.  By contrast, the ratio of the ring energy to the Alfv&eacute;n energy remains well within the range 0.25-4.0 suitable for IB instability throughout essentially all of the events, except those that occur in denser cold plasma of the outer plasmasphere.
