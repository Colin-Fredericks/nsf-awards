 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to imitate is crucial for human development, for transferring learned abilities from one generation to another, and perhaps even for understanding the intentions and actions of others. Interest in the processes of imitation has a long history but most of the research has focused on the imitation of visually observable actions. This research program focuses instead on vocal imitation, which emerges spontaneously in infants and plays an important communicative role in language acquisition, singing, and other expressive vocalizations. The studies combine behavioral and physiological measures of vocal imitation with a computational model in order to evaluate whether deficits in vocal imitation reflect a failure of auditory imagery or of the complex transformation from auditory perception to coordinated motor action.\r\n\r\nA potential application of this research is the development of interventions for individuals who have difficulty with vocal imitation, including pedagogical techniques to train \"tone deaf\" singers. A second potential application is to the learning of tonal languages such as Chinese, for which pitch information is critical.",

For skills that involve moving one&rsquo;s limbs (fingers, hands, feet), one can observe how successfully your actions match those you are trying to imitate. A more challenging scenario arises when we have to imitate sounds using our voice, which we do when we learn to speak. In such cases, we need to form an <em>internal model</em> in our brains of how sounds relate to actions, and this can be challenging and may be a basis for problems some people have in learning to speak or sing accurately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research supported by the National Science Foundation by Drs. Peter Pfordresher and Andrea Halpern tested this prediction by focusing on our ability to imitate pitches with our voice. Pitch is an important feature of both speech and song, and the vocal imitation of pitch via singing is associated with large individual differences that bedevil music educators. Based on preliminary studies, we predicted that the most important component of pitch imitation is the formation of an internal model, and that this internal model is in turn based on how well you can form a <em>mental image </em>for the pitches you plan to imitate. Past research shows that mental images for sound (imagining a tune in your head) lead to activity in brain areas used to plan actions. Thus the vividness and accuracy of mental images may reflect how well one&rsquo;s internal model is functioning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We conducted four studies that tested different components of this theory. Two studies directly related to the use of mental imagery in vocal imitation of pitch. In one study, we had participants listen to short pitch sequences (i.e., brief tunes), and then repeat them either in their original form, or after re-arranging the order of pitches, referred to as a <em>mental transformation. </em>The influence of mental transformations are important because this poses a challenges to one&rsquo;s mental image, which has to be re-shaped after it is initially formed. People in general find it difficult to reproduce mental transformations of pitch sequences, leading to lower accuracy. However, poor imitators exhibited a smaller effect, due to the fact that their initial image was already poorly specified. This result, illustrated in Figure 1, confirmed the importance of imagery formation in vocal pitch imitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second study focused on the role of muscle movements during imagery. Because mental images include both perceptual and motor activity in the brain, some low-level muscle contractions can occur during imagery, and this can be measured using <em>electromyography </em>(EMG). We measured muscle movements associated with pitch control, as well as facial and other skeletal muscles while participants imagined and then repeated pitch sequences (see Figure 2). We found strongest activation in pitch control muscles in general, but this activity was stronger in participants who imitated pitch inaccurately. This result suggests that muscle movements may be used to enhance a poorly formed auditory mental image.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third study compared imitation of pitch in song versus speech. Participants listened to spoken sentences and short melodies including the same words as in the sentences. Previous research using similar stimuli suggested that (a) people are better at imitating sung than spoken pitch, but (b) people who imitate pitch in song poorly are also poor at imitating spoken pitch. Our current study addressed a critical difference between song and speech: <em>intentions</em>. Specifically, when you hear a song, you know that pitch is important and may therefore try harder at imitating sung pitch than spoken pitch. We tested this possibility by varying instructions to emphasize pitch imitation more or less throughout the experimental session. Instructions did matter, but had a much larger impact on song than on speech (Figure 3), suggesting that pitch does matter for speech and in fact may be a rather &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; feature in speech imitation. Furthermore, we found that instructions mattered more for people who imitate pitch inaccurately overall. Poor imitators may need to try harder to imitate pitch than more accurate imitators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our fourth study addressed a different aspect of vocal imitation: The relationship between imitation accuracy and the ability to correct oneself during vocal production. If poor imitation relates to a poor internal model, then it is likely that poor imitators will not be able to use corrective auditory information to adjust their voice either. We tested this by having participants imitate pitch sequences on their own (as is usual), or by &ldquo;singing along&rdquo; with a correct version of the sequence. Accurate imitators do better with this accompaniment. However, inaccurate imitators can become even worse when they hear both their voice and an accompanying voice. Thus, if a music educator is attempting to help a struggling singer, possibly the worst thing to do is to have that person sing next to a more accurate singer!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Pfordresher</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256964/1256964_10232211_1495747834859_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256964/1256964_10232211_1495747834859_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1256964/1256964_10232211_1495747834859_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The two rows on the left show examples of a pitch sequence and different forms of reproduction (only one of several possible transformation conditions is illustrated).
