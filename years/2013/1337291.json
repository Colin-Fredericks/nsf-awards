This research will build on six prior seasons of fieldwork in Tanzania and Zambia (together TZAM) to bring new data to bear on this major linked event of environmental, climatic, and biotic change. Our team will gather multidisciplinary data (sedimentological, geochemical, vertebrate paleontological, paleobotanical, and geochronological) during two proposed seasons of fieldwork. In the lab, we will use geographic distribution and community food web models to address more general questions about mass extinctions and their subsequent recoveries. For example, do mass extinctions consistently cause certain types of community restructuring or do their effects vary with environment and geography? Does the ecological rebuilding of terrestrial communities proceed in a stereotyped way, regardless of the exact identities of the species involved? Answering these types of questions is an important step in the process of moving from documenting the causes and effects of this extinction event, to using it as a source of predictive information for dealing with modern biotic crises.\r\nVertebrate paleontology fascinates the public. Because of their visibility, dissemination of our results to the general public will primarily occur at the natural history museums involved in the project. In collaboration with the exhibits departments at the Field Museum and Burke Museum, we will create two exhibit installations focusing on Asilisaurus kongwe, a small dinosaur relative from Tanzania that is an icon of our research project. At the conclusion of the grant, the installations will be permanently transferred to the National Museum of Tanzania (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), and the Livingstone Museum (Livingstone, Zambia) where they will introduce local citizens to the rich paleontological heritage of their nations. We will also develop a level of the FMNH's paleontology video game Game of Bones focusing on Asilisaurus. The game level will be centered around discovering and excavating a specimen of Asilisaurus, reconstructing its anatomy, and making inferences about its paleobiology. The game level will be promoted on the main websites of the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), University of Washington Burke Museum (UWBM), and the California Academy of Science (CAS), the museums' social media sites, and web pages targeting science enthusiasts (e.g., FMNH: Science@FMNH, The Field Revealed; UWBM: BurkeBlog; CAS: Science Today and Science in Action).",

Rapid global warming, caused by huge volcanic eruptions in what is now Siberia, appear to have played a major role in the PTME, making it highly relevant for studies of the impact of modern human-induced climate change. Our best record how land ecosystems ere affected by the PTME, and recovered in its aftermath, comes from rocks preserved in South Africa. However, it has proven difficult to determine whether the changes observed there are indicative of global patterns or if they preserve a more regional signal of change. This project seeks to expand our picture of how the PTME affected land ecosystems by studying fossils preserved in Zambia and Tanzania. Both countries have excellent records of land animals from the time just before and shortly after the PTME, but they have received relatively little interests from paleontologists. Learning about the ancient ecosystems of Tanzania and Zambia is a key step in determining whether the record preserved in South Africa reflects local or global effects of the PTME.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">With funding from this grant, our research group conducted five seasons of fieldwork in Permian and Triassic rocks in Tanzania and Zambia. Among the discoveries resulting from this work are several new species of the ancient mammal relatives that dominated land ecosystems before the PTME, as well as new relatives of crocodiles and dinosaurs that played a key role in the recovery following the extinction. More broadly, our work shows that land ecosystems across southern Africa were relatively uniform in structure and composition before the PTME. However, the extinction fragmented these communities, and communities in Tanzania and Zambia recovered differently from that in South Africa, with crocodile and dinosaur relatives playing a much more important role in Tanzania and Zambia. The way in which animals interacted with each other in the recovered communities also differed between Tanzania and Zambia on one hand and South Africa on the other, showing that there are multiple ways to rebuild stable ecosystems after a mass extinction. <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">Our</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\"> </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">multi-disciplinary </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">research </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">has </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">firmly establishe</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">d</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\"> these previously-understudied </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">areas</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\"> as premier locations for </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">studying</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\"> </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">the PTME</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\"> and encapsulates the synthetic approach to paleontological research promoted by the Earth-Life Transitions program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;
