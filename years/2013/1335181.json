 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pursue research in understanding interaction between light metal building frame and hard masonry wall through energy absorbing and robust connections under seismic and wind loading. Analytical research will be pursued for initial development of connections. Experimental research will be conducted in the laboratory for viable connections that are configured to transfer wind loads as well as absorb energy to enhance seismic performance. The goal is to develop connections in masonry walls that will work with the metal frame to enhance resistance of the system under multiple hazards. An industrial advisory group will assist in selecting connections for their practicality in construction. The light frame metal buildings are widely used for industrial and commercial buildings; improving resiliency of these buildings will reduce economic losses in hazards.\r\n\r\nThe research will be accomplished through a series of research tasks that include analytical modeling, experimental testing, development of a design methodology, and evaluation of system performance in multiple hazards. The first task will be to determine connection demands between stiff and flexible elements for seismic and wind events through analytical modeling. The second task will quantify the requisite strength, energy dissipation and connection deformation demands required to achieve enhanced performance. The third task will be design, analysis and comparative evaluation of energy dissipation and robustness of connections through nonlinear finite element analysis. Experimental testing of connections with high performance potential while being economical and constructible will follow. The final task will be assessment of building system for energy absorption capacity and robustness under wind and seismic loading. The education and outreach components include high school students attending Engineering Day, college students mentoring high school students and targeted outreach to professional practice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of metal building systems has become commonplace in today?s society and they are commonly used for schools, churches, commercial and industrial buildings to name a few.  For well over two decades, the performance of metal building systems during seismic events (earthquakes) has been the subject of intense research.  It was revealed that the concrete or masonry exterior cladding (hard wall cladding)  in metal building systems is susceptible to falling away from the structure in major seismic events.  The majority of the past research efforts, both experimental and analytical, has been focused on improving the seismic performance of the metal building moment frame (perpendicular to the ridge).  In order to obtain a more complete picture of the seismic performance of metal building systems clad with hard walls, the seismic performance of the longitudinal direction (parallel to the ridge) needed to be investigated.  The research completed in this project focused on understanding and improving the longitudinal seismic performance of metal building systems clad with hard walls.\n\nPost-earthquake reconnaissance following the Port-au-Prince Haiti 2010 earthquake and the Christchurch New Zealand earthquake 2011 highlighted the dangerous effects of connection failures in the hard walls of metal building systems.  The difference in behavior of the stiff, heavy concrete or masonry walls and the light, flexible steel framing creates large forces at the interface between the two systems.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that little to no coordination between the metal building systems (MBS) engineer and the engineer-of-record who is responsible for the connections between the walls and the frame, which can result in improper connection design. When these connections fail in a non-ductile or brittle manner, the loss of lateral support for the wall can result in the wall falling away from the structure.  Collapsing concrete wall panels or falling masonry in metal buildings are a life safety issue, as well as an economic concern as they require repair before the building can be reoccupied.\n\n  This project developed a simple, reliable, friction-based energy dissipating connection, the rotational friction connection (RFC).  The energy dissipating mechanism of the connection is geared towards the in-plane horizontal direction (parallel to the ridge), while maintaining out-of-plane strength for the lateral support of the wall.  To assess the energy dissipating capacity and reliability of the rotational friction connection, a series of experimental tests were performed to assess the connection performance under the types of loads that would be expected in a severe windstorm or seismic event.  Results show that the connection exhibits high ductility, repeatability and resiliency.  Replacement of the connection following a seismic event would not be required.  3-D solid finite element analytical models were developed using Abaqus (a simulation software) and validated using the experimental data.  A parametric analytical study was performed to expand upon the experimental dataset.  A simplified component level RFC model was created in a general purpose computational structural analysis software and calibrated using the results from the Abaqus model. \n\nA 3-D global finite element model of the complete metal building system with hard walls was developed to evaluate the improvement that RFCs have on the structure?s seismic performance.   Nonlinear dynamic response history computer analyses were performed using four levels of seismic hazard ranging from a service-level earthquake up to a maximum-considered earthquake event.  A baseline metal building that does not utilize the RFCs served as a comparison with a metal building system that was equipped with RFCs.  Results show that there was a reduction in the longitudinal story drifts, significant reductions in the inelastic demands in the longitudinal bracing system, as well as a slight improvement in the moment frame demands.\n\nThe results of both the experimental and analytical testing indicate the rotational friction connection shows great potential as a ductile fuse element in metal building system with hard wall cladding. The improved performance with a Rotational Friction Connection will result in significant reduction in the displacements and the damage that a structure would experience due to an earthquake. The improved connection ductility also minimizes the potential for the wall to lose lateral support. The overall benefit of utilizing this connection is an increase in resilience due to the decrease in damage potential and marked reduction in probability of injury or fatality due to falling masonry or a toppling wall panel. The decrease in damage will result in a quicker return to service for the building after the extreme event. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin D Marshall"
