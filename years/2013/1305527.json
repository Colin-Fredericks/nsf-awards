Complex experiments using free electron lasers at SLAC in California and at DESY in Germany, or low energy antiproton beams at CERN in Switzerland, are a challenge to explain for modern theoretical methods using massively parallel supercomputers.  Our project will provide new insights into the quantal dynamics found in the photon electron, and antiproton ionization of atoms like He, Li, and Mg, as well as molecules like H2 and Li2.\r\n \r\nSince atomic and molecular processes are present in most physical phenomena, ranging from astronomical observations of the early universe to laboratory production of microchips a more complete understanding of the few body dynamics of atoms and molecules can lead to a wealth of new scientific discoveries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputational methods are applied to a wide variety of atomic\n\nand molecular collision processes in support of a better understanding\n\nof the astrophysical and laboratory sciences.  Current activities\n\ninclude the calculation of laser interactions with atoms and molecules,\n\nthe dynamics of cold atomic and molecular gases, antiproton collisions\n\nwith atoms and molecules at low energies, and the ionization of atoms\n\ndue to collisions with bare charged atomic ions, neutrons, and\n\npossible weakly interacting massive particles.\n\n \n\nExample papers:\n\nFive-Photon Double Ionization of Helium,\n\nY. Li, M. S. Pindzola, and J. Colgan,\n\nJournal of Physics B 49 055401 (2016)\n\nA time-dependent close-coupling method is used to calculate the\n\nfive-photon double ionization of He.  It is found that the\n\ngeneralized cross section used in the past for two-photon double\n\nionization of He cannot be extended to five-photon double\n\nionization of He.  Therefore only five-photon double ionization\n\nprobabilities that depend on specfic radiation field pulses can\n\nbe calculated.\n\n \n\nMultiphoton Double Ionization of Helium\n\nusing Femtosecond Laser Pulses,\n\nM. S. Pindzola, Y. Li, and J. Colgan,\n\nJournal of Physics B (accepted)\n\nA time-dependent close-coupling method is used to calculate the\n\nmultiphoton double ionization of He using femtosecond laser pulses.\n\nTotal double ionization probabilities are caclulated for 2,3,4,and 5\n\nphoton absorption in the energy range from 10 eV to 60 eV.  Single\n\nand triple differential probabilities are calculated for 2,3,4, and 5\n\nphoton absorption at energies where the total ionization probability\n\nis near a maximum.  For circular polarization the total and differential\n\nprobabilities are consistently smaller compared to linear polarization\n\nas the number of photons absorbed is increased while keeping the\n\nradiation field constant.  For linear polarization, the\n\ntotal and differential probabilities vary substantially as a function\n\nof photons absorbed due to the presence of more absorption pathways.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael S Pindzola"
