 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Dagstuhl workshop is to bring together scientists from the research areas of Design Verification, Formal Methods, High-level Design, Manufacturing Testing, Robust System Design, and related disciplines in the context of integrated circuit manufacturing. The objective is to discuss major upcoming obstacles in the design, verification, and testing of robust systems and their potential solutions. Existing pre-silicon verification is insufficiently scalable, and today's manufacturing test methodologies may not be adequate in screening marginal and reliability failures. Bugs and defects that impact system correctness and/or security must be detected, localized, and corrected in the system environment, during post-silicon validation, or during system operation in the field. New methodologies, that are radical departures from today's practice and require multi-disciplinary effort spanning traditionally distinct research areas are to be  discussed.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this workshop is expected to influence US semiconductor industry by making connections between the academic and industrial researchers. The industry experts present at the workshop will also be instrumental in the benchmarking efforts critical to the research in the field. The workshop will also use the technical topic as a means to assess the value of joint collaborations between the relevant US and German scientific communities and explore various collaboration mechanisms that can be supported by the respective funding agencies. To this end, the workshop is co-sponsored by the German Science Foundation (DFG) as well.",
