 "awd_abstract_narration": "To be practical and sustainable tools for innovation, the coming generation of community-engagement and crowd-sourcing platforms need to improve the user experience of participants, while simultaneously providing a reliable mechanism for synthesizing participants' contributions into usable problem-solving outputs. In the present project, a multi-disciplinary research team will explore how community participation spreads, the effects of feedback on participation, and the changes in community and collaboration structure over time. Empirically, the project lays out three research questions: 1) characteristics of participatory government platforms, 2) behavioral and system challenges over time, and 3) the impact of managerial and design interventions on individual behaviors and network structure.\r\n\r\nThe specific platform for this research is \"10,000 Solutions\", a many-to-many system managed by Arizona State University that empowers both individuals and organizations to host and participate in solutions, challenges, and collective actions. The research team will study participation in \"10,000 Solutions\" across online, physical, and hybrid environments, particularly focusing on participant community building, trajectories of participation, and output usability. A diverse slate of experiments, with the application of the application of agent-based modeling and network analysis, will provide useful insights for theory development on community engagement and participation, as well as generating best-practice guidelines for participatory design, operation, assessment and implementation.\r\n\r\nFuture advances in economic growth and national security require new technologies for harnessing the wisdom of crowds and the power of public innovation. However, these technologies are still in their infancy, and there is a growing need for robust and flexible platforms that can move beyond exploratory efforts, toward real-world deployment. The project will develop evidence-based policies and practices to improve collaboration while increasing perceptions of accountability, legitimacy and individual satisfaction, the effectiveness of the work outputs and the adoption and use of the products developed by the community and through the platform. Knowing the conditions that increase and sustain collective action will help in devising policies and practices for building platforms to enhance participation in government and nongovernment organizations.",

The general concepts of open innovation or citizen science has transformed how knowleged is created, and by whom. Although there have been important contributions to crowdsourcing science and innovation, there is still a need to scientifically understand how to enroll, engage, connect, and develop these communities to more regularly produce usable outcomes, develop the skills and expertise of the participants, and design hybrid platforms that achieve their intended results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These new collaborative technologies, participatory platforms, enable the creation of innovative ideation and problem solving by the public that can be used to improve the effectiveness of organizations. This multi-year participatory action research project has studied the design, management, and evaluation of participatory platforms from the perspective of the managing organizations. During this project two unique platforms were designed and studied, and three other platforms were studied to better understand how the reliability of participatory platforms can be improved, thereby making such platforms a viable option for organizational problem solving, ideation, and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work advanced in two stages. The first stage of the research focused on how organizations can use ideation from open user innovation. The second stage focused on how hybridity, the combination of online and offline participation, impacts open user innovation in organizations. The focus of this particular research was on public sector organizations, though findings can be useful for any sector interested in open innovation. The research team was able to improve specificity of platform design in terms of aligning goals, participation, and evaluation of platforms with organizational objectives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Findings highlighted in this research center on organizational actions taken to improve participatory platform outcomes, and arrangements of hybridity. Of particular interest are [1] the use of innovation intermediary administrators and departments that are purposely implemented within organizations, and [2] three hybridity arrangments used in practice including unintentional, segmented, and fluid hybridity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The researchers also used agent based modeling and participatory modeling with the administrators responsible for these platforms to understand system level dynamics and the evolution of the platform, the community, and the ideas. One interesting finding discovered through this process was the finding that common outcome measures, like high numbers of participants, were actually counterproductive to the health and sustainability of the community of participants. Administrators and participants noted that an authentic interaction between the participants was most likely to lead to a deeper level of engagement. However, when driving a large number of people to participate, the liklihood for a connection to be made with someone else is decreased, thus threatening the sustainability of the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally we found that while many platforms rely on a cash prize to motivate participation, in the areas of open innovation, citizen science, and open governance, other forms of motivation are more appropriate for both enrolling participants and attracting the 'right' participants. In particular, we found that quick, meaningful feedback increased future participation--that people wanted their voice to be heard by someone that could implement their solution, they wanted to connect with other people that shared their curiosity or interests, and they wanted to feel like they had influence in the communities about which they cared. Each of these motivations has consequences on how to design participtory platforms that diverge from the best pratices used before this research. The lessons learned in this research have been applied to subsequent participtory platforms and innovation challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, this research will inform the next generation of work, collaboration, and innovation. More people will increasingly have access to participate in additional communities, jobs, and coversations. Designing these participatory platforms that take into consideration all parts of the system including the motivations and values of participants, intermediaries, and benificiaries will lead to more valuable and efficient ways of generating innovation and advancing science.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
