 "awd_abstract_narration": "In marine species, movement of individuals between sites is facilitated by long distance ocean dispersal but this may hamper the ability of populations to evolve adaptations in response to differences in environments. In the Hawaiian waterfall-climbing goby fish, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, island populations are connected through oceanic larval dispersal but juveniles entering freshwater streams on each island encounter different environmental pressures during migration upstream. Our study uses models of ocean currents, environmental features, land use practices, and the strength of natural selection between streams to predict survival and distribution of adults and juveniles across the Hawaiian Islands. We will compare these predicted patterns to measured values of genetic and morphological traits to better understand the relative roles of natural selection, ocean dispersal, and chance in maintaining viable populations of this native Hawaiian fish.\r\n\r\nOur results will identify populations most likely to persist and those most critical to future reproductive success. Such results will aid the Hawai?i Division of Aquatic Resources in designing plans to protect this unique and culturally important Hawaiian fish. In addition, undergraduates at Clemson University and in-service public school teachers, through SC Life, will be trained in inquiry-based research and molecular and computational techniques.",
