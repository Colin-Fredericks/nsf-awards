Beyond providing a vehicle for communicating the most significant new research results, one of the principal objectives is to stimulate new ideas through cross-fertilization between the different domains represented. We will also focus our energies on providing an environment in which young researchers can immerse themselves in contemporary research trends. The junior participants will interact with not only the leaders in their fields, but also with the brightest students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty worldwide. Information on registration, accommodations, financial support, and scheduling can be found at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Geometry2012/index.php/",
