 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diverse butterfly subtribe Euptychiina contains more than 400 species in Central and South American habitats ranging from rainforest to cerrado. Hundreds of thousands of euptychiine specimens in natural history museum collections hold untapped data for studies in many fields, but almost half of all specimens are difficult to confidently identify. At least 20% of species have no scientific name and 65% of genera are invalid. This project has 5 main goals: (1) to combine morphological and DNA data to produce a comprehensive evolutionary hypothesis for the subtribe and define genera; (2) to revise the classification for 9 genera containing 159 species (35 to be named), and to name an additional 21+ species in other Euptychiina genera; (3) to train butterfly researchers at the University of Florida and at the University of Campinas, Brazil; (4) to test hypotheses about Euptychiina evolution; (5) and to develop collection and web-based electronic resources to facilitate future research.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide a reliable classification and understanding of species diversity in Euptychiina and use these to begin to investigate how these organisms diversified and what factors control their current distribution, helping to predict how changing land use and climate are likely to impact their diversity.The project will train 1 post-doctoral researcher, 3 graduate students and other university and high-school students, with special efforts to include minorities. Museum collections will be enhanced and an NSF-funded, web-based informatics platform for storage and rapid sharing of taxonomic data will be adapted for use by the team and for future butterfly researchers. The project website will provide biological data, images and publications, and data will also be available to online biodiversity initiatives such as GBIF, EoL and iDigBio where they will be freely accessible. Finally, the project will be featured for one year and to more than 200,000 visitors as a component of the Florida Museum of Natural History's \"Library of Life\" exhibit, highlighting current research at the museum.",

Caterpillars of most of these butterflies feed on grasses and bamboos, and while some species are common and widespread, others only occur near stands of their host plant. Many adult euptychiines feed on fermenting fruit and are therefore commonly recorded in fruit-baited traps in studies that examine how butterfly communities respond to changing seasons and landscapes. However, despite their visibility, diversity and potentially broad research value, our understanding of the true number of euptychiine species, how to identify them, how they are related, and where they occur, has historically been extremely poor. At the start of this project, many known species still required formal scientific description and the majority of named species were believed to be misclassified, both major impediments to expanding our knowledge of these butterflies. We therefore initiated a broad collaborative project studying euptychiine evolution, using information from both morphology and genetic sequences, as well as research on problematic groups of species.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project team produced or contributed to 63 scientific papers, including three focused on the evolution of the group, 43 on species classifications, nine on community ecology, and eight on species biology. By sampling across many genes of 81 euptychiine species we obtained about forty times the data used in previous studies and were able to finally clarify the evolutionary relationships among several very rapidly evolving groups. Another key study similarly reconstructed the evolution of euptychiines using aspects of their morphology. Together, these studies have provided the foundation for further work focused on revising the classification of the entire group; nine new genera, 60 new species and seven new subspecies were described and named, and 102 species were comprehensively reviewed. In several genera we discovered that similar wing patterns, such as a white band on the hindwing or an iridescent blue upperside, have evolved multiple times and do not reflect a close relationship, although the factors driving this repeated evolution need investigation. Two new genera (<em>Amiga</em>, <em>Graphita</em>)<em> </em>were described for common, widespread species formerly misplaced in such catch-all genera. Other new genera were named for species that are very rare, with one, <em>Cristalinaia</em>, described for a new species discovered during this project as a caterpillar at a single south Amazonian locality. In another genus, <em>Caeruleuptychia</em>, males and females differed so much in wing pattern that they were placed in different genera, but genetic sequences revealed their true identities. Species diversity proved to be dramatically underestimated in some genera; in <em>Zischkaia</em>, we added nine new species to the existing three, and in <em>Euptychia</em> 17 new species were described, doubling the total in the genus. Our research has uncovered more than a dozen euptychiine genera and almost 150 species that are still in need of description.</p>\n<p>To contribute to broader research into euptychiine biology and evolution, the project also compiled information on the distribution and natural history of euptychiines. We transcribed the information on labels of thousands of specimens in museum collections and gathered records from the literature, online and field work to map euptychiine distributions. Efforts to find eggs and caterpillars in the field and rear them to adults resulted in descriptions of the life histories of 15 euptychiine species. Studies in southeastern Brazil examined the effects of forest fragmentation, edges, fires and urbanization on butterfly communities, with euptychiines comprising about a third of studied species. As one of the few butterfly groups that is diverse both within forest as well as in grassland habitats, euptychiines are a potentially important study group for examining how natural and man-made disturbance impact biodiversity.</p>\n<p>Collaboration among countries, institutions and across educational levels was an important component of this project. The project provided training and/or research experiences for one middle school student, two high school students, 40 undergraduates, 10 graduate students, three recent graduates, one postdoc and four volunteers. A number of students and postdocs have continued in higher level education or secured academic positions. The project produced or contributed&nbsp;to papers involving more than 100 co-authors, and 32 researchers and students were co-authors on descriptions of new euptychiine taxa, from 8 countries (Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Panama, Peru, Singapore, United Kingdom and USA). Collections of euptychiine adult specimens, immature stages and tissue samples in South America, United Kingdom and USA were substantially revised and expanded, providing a foundation for future research in the group. The project also provided online resources including a bibliography of papers on euptychiines, a revised checklist of species, and enhancements to existing webpages on Neotropical butterflies.
