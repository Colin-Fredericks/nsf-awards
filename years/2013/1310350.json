 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Rabi A. Musah and Robert B. Cody both at the State University of New York at Albany who will direct a project to investigate volatile organosulfur compounds (VOSCs) that are emitted by representative plants to the environment using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS). In order to determine the possible fates of these compounds in the atmosphere, the gas-phase reactions of identified compounds when exposed to atmospherically relevant radicals, such as ozone, hydroxyl and NOx species, will be investigated. In collaboration with industrial partner JEOL USA Inc., a platform that interfaces with the JEOL AccuTOF Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART\u00ae) mass spectrometer will be developed to permit high resolution DART-MS analysis of VOSCs under ambient conditions in air. The biogeochemistry of VOSCs has been the focus of significant attention because of increased awareness of their contribution to atmospheric sulfur, and hence their potential to influence the climate globally.\r\n\r\nThis research will facilitate the study of not only the fates of plant emitted VOSCs, but also the extent to which they may ultimately contribute to the overall atmospheric sulfur burden, and influence pollution, acid rain, and cloud formation, among other phenomena. The developed analytical tools would be commercially available and find broad utility for analyses relevant to a range of other fields including chemistry, biochemistry, forensics chemistry, food sciences, agriculture, and medicine. The integration of teaching and research between the postdoctoral trainee and graduate student on the one hand, and the JEOL scientists on the other, unimpeded by departmental or administrative boundaries, will cultivate a cultural shift in research-based instruction. The trainees will gain a breadth of skills, strengths, and understanding to work in an interdisciplinary team environment while being grounded with depth of knowledge in a major field. The training will provide scientific preparation for the student and the postdoctoral associate whether they pursue academic or non-academic careers and it will provide a breeding ground for exploration and application of novel experimental approaches to resolve problems.",

Sulfur sources from the oceans are well catalogued, and those from volcanoes as well as various anthropogenic activities have been quantified. However, it has been noted that these sources by themselves do not balance the sulfur budget in the atmosphere. This project proposed that a contributor to the sulfur in the atmosphere is terrestrial plant emissions, and it sought to determine not only the identities of these compounds, but also what the possible fates of these compounds are in the atmosphere when they are exposed to atmospherically relevant radicals, such as ozone, hydroxyl and NOx species.

The project supported three postdoctoral trainees, 4 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and two visiting scientists. It also resulted in the development of intellectual property which is being developed to commercialize a device that can be used for mass spectrometry imaging.&nbsp; The study revealed that the organosulfur compounds emitted into the atmosphere, such as thiosulfinates, rapidly react with hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Thus, the compounds themselves contribute little to global warming because they have lifetimes of a day or less in most cases. However, the subsequent reactions of the products generated when the emitted VOCSs interact with hydroxyl and chlorine radicals, ultimately results in the formation of the greenhouse gas sulfur dioxide. Thus, the VOSC emissions from terrestrial plants serve as masked forms of SO<sub>2</sub>. Among the broader impacts of the results of this work are the potentially profound implications that the discoveries have in terms of our understanding of the contributors to environmental sulfur. They hint at the possibility that VOSC-producing cash crops may contribute to environmental sulfur. The research also led to new discoveries in other areas of chemistry that involve compounds related to those investigated in this project. For example, the methods developed to track the formation and reactions of VOSCs by DART-MS could be directed to answer questions of relevance in forensic chemistry. Chemical mimics of the compounds that serve as precursors of the plant-derived VOSCs could be developed into anti-cancer agents. It was also revealed that there are plants with a chemical defense mechanism defined by the emission of a burst of VOSC?s by their roots in response to touch.
