 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Paul Baures from Keene State College and colleagues Brian Anderson, James Kraly, Richard Blatchly and Denise Junge will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) medicinal chemistry research on inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cholera; (b) conformational analysis of imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (I45DA) derivatives; (c) development of nature-inspired antifreeze coatings; (d) peptide-lipid self-assembly; (e) structural characterization of resveratrol isomers and derivatives; (f) synthesis and characterization of ionic liquids; (g) synthesis and mechanistic studies of metal catalysts; (h) synthesis of dopamine D1-agonists; and (i) studies of structure-function relationships of inorganic complexes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at Keene State College but also at Saint Anselm College and other neighboring institutions and local industrial partners.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  This MRI award enabled the purchase of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer that has supported the research efforts six faculty at Keene State College, three faculty at Plymouth State University, and one faculty member each at Colby-Sawyer College, Marlboro College, and Franklin Pierce University.  Markem-Imaje, an international company in specialty inks and printers, has also used the instrument for quality control and research efforts.  The research projects of the faculty include investigations in the area of cancer, infectious diseases like cholera and tuberculosis, and the pigmentation disorder, porphyria.  In addition, fundamental research in organic and inorganic chemistry was supported by this instrument grant. \n\n \n\nThe NMR spectrometer significantly improved the infrastructure at KSC for research and the research training of students.  Key features of the instrument allow for faculty and students to collect data through a menu and thereby increased the accessibility of many complicated experiments that were otherwise challenging to execute.  A resulting increase in the productivity of the researchers was realized, and three peer-reviewed publications have been reported to date with others now in the works.\n\n \n\nStudents have also benefited from the capabilities of this new instrument, and now are collected their own data by their second year of classes.  This provides valuable research experience the students will benefit from after graduation, whether they choose to enter the job market or go on to pursue an advanced degree.  An estimated 150 students have gained hands-on experience with the instrument since installation, and one-third of those are chemistry students that have been able to use the instrument to collect data for their research projects.  Many of these students have presented their findings in poster and oral formats at national, regional, and local meetings.  To date the instrument provided data in support of twenty posters or talks given by fourteen different students at these meetings.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts.  This MRI award supported the purchase of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer, an instrument that is so valuable to the field of chemistry that it is a requirement for accreditation by the American Chemical Society.  KSC achieved such accreditation in 2013, and this benefits both the college and our graduates.  Moreover, KSC is a public liberal arts college with a significant number of first generation students.  Education is an important step in improving the career opportunities for these students and the state of New Hampshire in general.  The NMR spectrometer helps provide a quality research experience that prepares these students for their future.\n\n \n\nA total of five externally funded grants benefitted from the instrument, with support coming from the American Chemical Society (1), the National Science Foundation (1), and the National Institutes of Health (3).  These projects and the experimental results help to identify potential solutions to scientific problems while providing valuable experiences for KSC students.  The instrument provides a significant infrastructure improvement that helps faculty compete for these grants and enable these opportunities. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul W Baures"
