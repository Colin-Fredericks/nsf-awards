 "awd_abstract_narration": "One dominant characteristic of today's large-scale computing systems\r\nis the prevalence of large storage clusters.  Storage clusters at the\r\nscale of hundreds or thousands of commodity machines are\r\nincreasingly being deployed. At companies like Amazon, Google, Yahoo,\r\nand others, thousands of nodes are managed as a single system.\r\n\r\nAs large clusters have brought many benefits, they also bring a new\r\nchallenge: a growing number and frequency of failures that must be\r\nmanaged. Bits, sectors, disks, machines, racks, and many other\r\ncomponents fail.  With millions of servers and hundreds of data\r\ncenters, there are millions of opportunities for these components to\r\nfail. Failing to deal with failures will directly impact the\r\nreliability and availability of data and jobs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we still hear data-loss stories even recently. For\r\nexample, in March 2009, Facebook lost millions of photos due to\r\nsimultaneous disk failures that \"should\" rarely happen at the same\r\ntime (but it happened); in July 2009, a large bank was fined a record\r\ntotal of 3 millions pounds after losing data on thousands of its\r\ncustomers; more recently, in October 2009, T-Mobile Sidekick, which\r\nuses Microsoft's cloud service, also lost its customer data.  These\r\nincidents have shown that existing large-scale storage systems are\r\nstill fragile to failures.\r\n\r\nTo address the challenges of large-scale recovery, the goal of this\r\nproject is to: (1) seek the fundamental problems of recovery in\r\ntoday's scalable world of computing, (2) improve the reliability,\r\nperformance, and scalability of existing large-scale recovery, and (3)\r\nexplore formally grounded languages to empower rigorous specification\r\nof recovery properties and behaviors.  Our vision is to build systems\r\nthat \"DARE to fail\": systems that deliberately fail themselves,\r\nexercise recovery routinely, and enable easy and correct deployment of\r\nnew recovery policies.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit this website:\r\nhttp://boom.cs.berkeley.edu/dare/",

The DARE project produces several outcomes. \n\nWith FATE (Failure Testing Service) and DESTINI (Declarative Testing Specifications), recovery is systematically tested in the face of multiple failures and correct recovery is specified clearly, concisely, and precisely.  FATE and DESTINI can explore over 40,000 failure scenarios including multiple failures in a single system and easily express tens of recovery specifications. \n\nWith PreFail (a programmable failure-injection tool), which advances FATE, testers can write a wide range of policies to prune down the large space of multiple failures and spend 10X&sbquo;&Auml;&igrave;200X less time than exhaustive testing. \n\nWith HARDFS, cloud storage such as HDFS can recovery from fail-silent (non fail-stop) behaviors that result from memory corruption and software bugs.  HARDFS employs a new approach: selective and lightweight versioning (SLEEVE).  HARDFS recovers orders of magnitude faster than full reboot by using micro-recovery. \n\nWith SAMC (Semantic-Aware Model Checking), the scalability of distributed systems model checkers are significantly improved.
