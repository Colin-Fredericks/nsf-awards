(Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret data, and Think of the next Experiment), uses intensive analysis of primary and other scientific literature to demystify and humanize science.  To date, it has been introduced in numerous upper-level capstone courses and a single introductory stand alone course.  The current CREATE toolkit includes the use of concept maps, sketching, figure annotation, experimental design, grant panels, and student email interviews of paper authors. These tools are applied to analysis of primary or other scientific literature that illuminates key concepts of biology or the nature of science. This project is investigating how best to deploy CREATE strategies at initial stages of a curriculum and how best to integrate CREATE strategies at intermediate levels of a curriculum in traditionally-taught courses. The PIs are testing a full-semester City College of New York (CCNY) CREATE course for first-year students in distinct new student cohorts, and testing the effectiveness of embedding a two-week CREATE module into an otherwise traditionally-taught Genetics course. They are investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of interventions at each curricular level, by assessing students' cognitive and attitudinal gains using a critical thinking test and a survey of student attitudes/abilities/beliefs.  The first-year CCNY Introduction to Scientific Thinking course is being tested with first-year students at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and Rowan University. Multi-week CREATE interventions in Genetics are being developed and tested at all three campuses. The data is providing insight into the adaptability of this teaching/learning strategy. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  CREATE has been tested previously in full-semester elective courses for upper-level students and found to lead to gains in critical thinking, content integration, student self-rated attitudes/abilities, and maturation of aspects of students' epistemological beliefs about science. This project explores the potential of the approach to be adapted at a less intense level and in a wider array of courses. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The PI is also conducting a series of CREATE faculty development workshops (supported by NSF 1021443). To date 96 faculty from a wide variety of community and 4-year colleges and universities have been involved in these workshops.  Many of the graduates from the faculty development project teach at institutions where options for teaching non-traditionally are limited, making effective short-term CREATE interventions particularly appealing. Outcomes from this new CREATE protocol can inform the faculty development project and that project and the graduates from it can help disseminate outcomes from this new project to a wide number of faculty from diverse institutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientists conduct creative research, puzzle over results, debate interpretations with colleagues, and write up their results in professional journals but college Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students typically listen to lectures based on textbooks. Thus the teaching of college science is not well-aligned with the practices of science.   Textbooks tend to emphasize breadth rather than depth, and to focus on conclusions reached by scientists rather than what studies were conducted and how the data gathered led to particular conclusions.   With the goal of contributing to development of a solution to this problem, our project focuses on an alternative we developed to traditional teaching--teaching college biology courses through close critical analysis of scientific literature.  \n\nOur strategy, termed CREATE (Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret the data, Think of the next Experiment), emphasizes close analysis of data and encourages students to examine studies as if they had carried the work out themselves.  Scientific creativity is promoted by experimental design assignments, and collegial argumentation in grant panel exercises models the sort of discourse common to working scientists but typically absent from the classroom.  \n\nOur previous work indicates that students in full-term CREATE courses taught by faculty trained in multiday CREATE pedagogy workshops make diverse significant gains, including in critical thinking, experimental design ability, self confidence and scientific thinking ability.  We also learned that some faculty do not feel comfortable dropping traditional lecture altogether and devoting a full term to primary literature.  Other faculty do not have time to attend pedagogy workshops.  We thus designed a project aimed at examining whether a) faculty could teach successfully from a pre-written scripted CREATE module after minimal pre-class pedagogical training  b) whether students would learn as much core course information in courses that devoted 3-4 class sessions to CREATE, as in 100% lecture courses,  and c) whether students in the \"brief dose of CREATE\" courses would make additional gains. We tested these issues in Introduction to Genetics courses on three campuses; a large public university, an urban minority serving institution, and a small liberal arts college. We found that participating faculty, including adjunct professors, successfully taught CREATE after minimal training, using a module pre-written by the PIs. Students in CREATE sections did not 'lose' in core genetics knowledge, and in fact outperformed students in traditional sections on an assessment of genetics understanding.  In addition, CREATE students gained in self-efficacy and reported deeper understanding of scientific research, which they attributed to the journal article analyzed.  Interestingly, students in traditional sections became less epistemologically mature during the semester of genetics.  CREATE students did not show this decrease in epistemological maturity. \n\nAdditionally, we developed a general education course, Scientific Process and Biological Discovery, and have offered the course for credit to underrepresented students taking part in a pre-college summer institute at a state university.   This course, which uses CREATE pedagogies throughout, engages students with the process of scientific inquiry while developing academic and scientific skills necessary for success in university STEM majors. \n\nWe have broadened the knowledge base for STEM teaching/learning by making it easier for faculty who typically lecture to successfully integrate primary scientific literature into their teaching.  We have developed a scripted module approach to primary literature that can be adapted for any topic in STEM thus allowing more students to be exposed to the process of scientific inquiry as undergraduates.  By disseminating our work through workshops, meetings, and publications, these techniques may be applied broadly.  This is especially significant since CREATE strategies can be used to teach scientific inquiry in a cost-effective way  since there is no wet lab component. Thus, the strategy can be used at a wide variety of colleges and universities including those with budgetary limitations.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alison Krufka"
