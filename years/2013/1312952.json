 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at better understanding the controllability structure  of coupled fluid-elastic systems. Specifically,  we focus on the situation of a fluid in a three-dimensional domain with a flexible boundary that is described by a  plate or membrane equation. We suggest several problems which serve to address our fundamental question: How much control in one or more components of the  coupled system is needed to obtain (i) controllability  or approximate controllability of the coupled system or (ii) partial controllability (approximate or exact) of one or more components of the system? The proposed research extends the  state-of-the-art in  several ways. First, the partial controllability problem in the context of a fluid-elastic system has not been addressed for the types of physically-based models we are considering. Secondly, many of the models we propose to analyze have not been studied even for well-posedness. This is a nontrivial step even in the linear case for some of the models (e.g., when considering free boundary conditions). However we also hope to address local controllability for the nonlinear problems associated with  the free boundary  problem for the Stokes system associated with a moving flexible boundary. Likewise we hope to make some progress in the case of a compressible Navier-Stokes fluid coupled with a plate. Our main analytical tool to attack these problems will be the method of Carleman estimates together with microlocal analysis. Development of Carleman estimates for these types of coupled systems might turn out to be be very useful in a broader context, as it is likely that a similar approach may be useful in the analysis of a variety of other types of coupled systems. We also propose to investigate the closely related inverse problem of determination of plate coefficients through knowledge of the appropriately defined Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with solutions of the coupled plate-fluid system.    \r\n\r\nThe fluid-elastic structures we aim to study arise in many practical applications. For example,the problem of minimizing the engine noise in a portion of an aircraft fuselage through controllers placed on and inside the aircraft is closely related to the partial controllability problem (ii) mentioned above. One specific fluid-elastic structure we plan to investigate is the cochlea, which is the  auditory organ in the inner ear that  translates sound vibrations to electrical impulses transmitted to the brain. A better understanding of the controllability structure of the cochlea could lead to an improved design of cochlear implants and hearing aids.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe central mathematical objective of the project was to investigate properties of distributed parameter control systems typical of those that describe fluid-structure interaction.  This includes stability analysis, inverse problems, and study of boundary interfaces relating to fluid, elastic and coupled fluid-elastic systems.  \n\nAdvances were made in applications to control theory of media that involves internal coupling to rigid bodies. The papers \"Null boundary controllability of a 1-dimensional heat equation with an internal point mass\", \"Modeling of a heat equation with a Dirac density\", and \"Null boundary controllability of a Schrodinger equation with an internal point mass interface\" address this type of problem in the cases of diffusion, heat transport and for solutions of Schrodinger's equation. The papers provide mathematical models and control theoretic results that should serve as a starting point for investigation of a broad range of coupled structures found in science and engineering.  The results concerning regularity of control spaces for the Schrodinger equation (wherein the regularity of the controllability spaces on either side of the point mass can differ or not, depending on the boundary conditions) are significant in that there are no similar results to be found in the literature.  Moreover, similar results also apply to the problem of controlling beams with internal rigid dynamics.      \n\nAdvances were made on the analysis of energy transmission due to impact.  Research for this problem was conducted in collaboration with graduate students Feifei Wang and Julia Anderson-Lee.  Wang's dissertation \"Computational Modeling of Impact and Deformation\", and the paper, \"Explicit solutions and coefficient of restitution for an elastic rod with viscous damping\" (by Wang and Hansen) analyze the problem of energy transfer due to contact boundary conditions and provide detailed analytical expressions for an energy-based coefficient of restitution. Anderson-Lee's thesis problem involves analysis of \"rocking block\" structures based on continuum mechanics, rather than the standard ordinary differential equation approach commonly used in the research literature.  The advantage of utilizing a continuum-based model is that it provides a natural description of vibrational energy and its connection to the impact boundary conditions.  Her results could be useful in the modeling and design of earthquake-resistant structures.  She is expected to graduate in December 2017.   \n\nConcerning physical fluid-structure problems, the paper \"Controllability of a passive cochlea model\" provides a simple mathematical model for a cochlea with an actuator embedded in the basilar membrane, similar to a cochlear implant.  The main result establishes controllability of the fluid-elastic structure via locally distributed control on a small portion of the basilar membrane.  \n\nThis work is novel in the sense that the cochlea has never been modeled or analyzed in the context of a distributed control system.  Although the model considered is quite basic, the results can serve as a starting point for investigation of more realistic models, both from a mathematical point of view and from the physiological perspective.\n\nAs indicated above, a significant portion of the research was conducted with graduate students who were supported by the grant.  Two of the three graduate students supported are female.  One of the students is Hispanic American and one is African American.  In this way the grant supported the participation of underrepresented minorities in science and technology. \n\nA variety of other aspects of the NSF project were researched and reported supported separately by co-PI Emanouilov.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott W Hansen"
