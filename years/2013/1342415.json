 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description of the Project\r\n\r\nThis BRIGE project explores new approaches to sensor-based surveillance in application to the prevention of age-related falls. Due to aging, all adults experience varying degrees of functional decline. This results in increased risk of falling in their daily activities. Importantly, risks of specific falls change dynamically during human interaction with the environment. Sensor data have been used for detection of falls shortly before impact. Despite wide use of sensor-based surveillance for tracking targets, tracking risks or hazards with sensors is an open problem. This research will examine how measurements from multiple sensors can be used to dynamically track the risks of falls in aging adults. By combining methods from statistical estimation and optimization, a new class of data association models will be created to represent the correspondence of sensor measurements to the fall related hazards and false alarms. False alarms are safe conditions that resemble the situations with an exposure to falling. A simulation of age-related falls on younger adults will be used to quantify risks of falls in accordance with sensor data. Finally, the combined datasets will be used to test and validate the new models. \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Description of the Project's Significance\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is to inform the development of the next-generation assistive mobility technology. Successful completion of this project will lead to developed and validated models to be used in smart, sensor-based devices that can help prevent costly and dangerous falls. This research has potential to prevent fall-related injuries, disability, and death in elderly and other vulnerable populations, thus extending the period of functional independence in older adults, reducing the need for caregivers, and alleviating the economic burden on society. Despite nationwide efforts to reduce falls, many elderly live in constant fear of falling in their home or public places. This BRIGE award provides funding to potentially enable new assistive mobility devices that will transform the way adults experience aging. This project overlaps with NSF strategic goal of innovating for society.\r\n\r\nActivities to Broaden the Participation of Underrepresented Groups in Engineering\r\n\r\nThe broadening participation activities integrated into this research project will build pathways to success in engineering careers for community college, undergraduate, and graduate students from historically underrepresented groups, including Hispanics, women, and first generation students. The PI will engage these students in experiential learning and research activities that will promote their interest in interdisciplinary engineering research, in particular in application to safe, patient-centered wellness and health. The students will be provided opportunities for structured professional development that will become a foundation for their long-term success. Specific plans are in place for enhancement of activities through the New Mexico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the National Graduate Education for Minorities consortium, the Society of Women Engineers and other on-campus organizations. This project will help create a strong foundation for integration of effective diversity and broadening participation activities into research, education, and innovation endeavors throughout the PI's career.\r\n\r\nThis research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.\r\n\r\nThe research is also funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which is part of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.",

Both the aging of the worldwide population and the direct medical costs associated with falls in older populations emphasize the need for addressing the issue of age-related falls. Age-related falls result in many detrimental ailments including reduced mobility, loss of functional independence, depression, trauma, or even death. To combat these issues, this project describes and evaluates a novel optimization-based approach for falls and near fall detection as well as situational awareness using a system of wearable sensors. The models used are formulated for ranking exposures to falls using information streamed from multiple complementary sensors. This method is considered a new application of the multidimensional assignment problem with the incorporation of the statistical estimation. The main purpose of this project is to prove that novel optimization model can be considered as an effective and efficient model for distinguishing risky and normal situations, specifically falls and near falls. To achieve this goal, a system of wearable sensors was constructed and used to conduct human subjects&rsquo; experiments in order to collect measurements during both normal walking and simulated movement perturbations that lead to a loss of balance. After presenting the computational algorithms used in estimation and application of the models on the collected experimental data, it was proven that this generally NP-hard optimization problem can be simplified into a polynomially solvable problem of finding a maximum of finitely many real numbers. For the first time in the literature, the potential effectiveness of the developed data-driven combinatorial optimization for sensor-based tracking of risks of falls during walking on a real-word data has been presented. This project was able to obtain the empirical results regarding the performance of the optimization procedure and compare the performance of data-driven optimization models to different parametric settings. It was found that a complete agreement among all sensors will lead to a more accurate detection and tracking of near falls while normal walking while tracking with sensor disagreement is less accurate. Additionally, it was found that a fine partitioning could be a good method to achieve better accuracy since finer partitioning will be helpful in avoiding the data overfitting. Through the past four years, the optimization models were improved and extended to account for stochastic and dynamic nature of the collected data. The differencing in the optimization were evaluated and it was found that this method has improved the falls exposures classification. The choice of the coordinate systems that impacted the performance of these method was also studied and it was found that spherical coordinate system shows better performance of this method than Euclidean coordinate system. Furthermore, the human subjects&rsquo; experiments were simulated and performed under four different conditions; the normal condition, the vision restrictions, the gait restriction, and both the vision and the gait restrictions and all our data-driven optimization models were evaluated and examined under all these conditions. The possibility to classify and characterize different kinds of exposures to falls could be used for acquiring the personalized data on situational risk of falls. In addition, the ability for distinguishing among exposures to falls can be used as an effective tool for mobility assistance and falls prevention.
