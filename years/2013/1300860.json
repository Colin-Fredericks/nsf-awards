 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to utilize the swelling-induced deformations of soft mechanical structures to dynamically shape materials. Adaptive structures that can bend and fold in an origami-like manner provide advanced engineering opportunities for deployable structures, soft robotic arms, mechanical sensors, and rapid-prototyping of 3D elastomers. Swelling is a robust approach to structural change as it occurs naturally in humid environments, and can easily be adapted into industrial design. Studies conducted under this award will identify the materials-defined length scales that dictate the mechanical response of a swelling structure. The swelling-structure interactions will be coupled with appropriate materials to controllably morph structures into a desired shape. The incorporation of polymerizable swelling materials will allow these complex shapes to be permanently fixed, thereby controlling the morphology of structures across many length scales.  \r\n\r\nA successful study will have broad implications for hierarchical manufacturing. The knowledge gained from these efforts will further the fundamental mechanical understanding of transient swelling-induced deformations, while developing a methodology for the permanent morphing of three-dimensional soft structures. This research will support the involvement of a strong, creative Ph.D. candidate, as well as academically driven undergraduate researchers. In addition to impacting education at the university level, this project will develop an innovative program to introduce local high school students to mechanics-driven phenomena. The program will use high-speed photography to show students the world of fast-moving science, and use this technology to study Newton's laws of motion.",
