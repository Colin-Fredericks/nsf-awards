This relatively small facility loaned nearly 3,000 samples during the previous funding cycle. Institutional support includes cold storage facilities, support for graduate student involvement, and support for the senior person in charge of the facility. The work plan includes continued description and logging of core, and accessioning of a new collection of analyzed glass separates from oceanic basalts.",
