 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to understand the foaming process using several foaming agents to guide us in the design of a new warm mix asphalt (WMA) technology. In the proposed project, researchers from Columbia University and Michigan Technological University will investigate three foaming agents as potential candidates, including soda as a chemical foaming agent, CO2/N2 gas and ethanol as physical blowing agents. Multiphase characterization and viscoelastic modeling studies will be conducted to investigate how the microstructure of asphalt materials evolves with time, temperatures, and proportion of material constituents, and in doing so study any differences and relative benefits from chemical vs. physical blowing agents. A single or the combination of foaming agents will be determined for optimal end-results. The fatigue strength, the long-term performance and life cycle cost of the WMA based on the foaming process will be characterized with accelerated test methods. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates state-of-the-art rheological and accelerated aging tests, thermodynamics, poromechanics, chemical changes and multi-scale modeling to identify the physical and mechanical properties of foamed asphalt materials. The proposed studies will advance the understanding of the foaming process and establish a theoretical framework to predict the material behavior for material design, which will lead to new theories and models of sustainable engineering materials in energy and environmental aspects. This project provides a unique opportunity for conducting interdisciplinary research in sustainable engineering to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, to facilitate recycling of asphalt materials, and improve life-cycle performance. The technologies developed in this program will be rapidly transferred to industry.",

The self-developed foamer is shown in Figure 1. The nozzle-based foaming method is accomplished by spraying a small amount of liquid foaming agent to the heated binder via a nozzle embedded in the function chamber. When a liquid droplet at an ambient temperature contacts with the heated binder, it exchanges energy with the surface of the liquid droplet by heating the droplet to a vapor state.&nbsp; This process results in explosive expansion of the droplets and generates a large amount of steam bubbles. The steam bubbles are forced into the continuous phase of binder under air pressure in the expansion chamber. With emission from the spray nozzle, the encapsulated steam expands until a thin film of slightly cooler binder holds the bubble intact through its surface tension. This process occurs for a multitude of asphalt bubbles thus produced foamed asphalt binder.</p>\n<p>The self-built foamer can accurately control the binder temperature, injected air pressure, water flowing rate, and expansion chamber temperature. The flow rate system configured in this setup is able to control the flow rate of the injected water down to 2 <em>ml</em>/minute with an accuracy of 1%. A high-speed long range Laser Displacement Sensor (LDS) which is shown in Figure 2 (a) is used to characterize asphalt foaming properties, with which the expansion ratio, half-life and foam index can be obtained. The LDS sends a pulse of laser light to a target surface and detects the reflection with a high accuracy of 0.02%. The LDS is linked to the LabVIEW software and configured with a 5Hz sampling frequency, which makes the LDS is capable to capture detailed information of the foaming evolution. The developed LDS is integrated into the foaming machine and designed to automatically measure the foaming evolution. It avoids any operation errors and thus provides objective, automatic, high accurate and repeatable measurements. The evolution of the foamed asphalt captured by the LDS is shown in Figure 2 (b). It shows that this foaming machine is able to automatically capture the detailed information of the entire foaming evolution from its generation, expansion, to collapse, and that it is able to generate foamed binder with expansion ratio as high as 15.</p>\n<p>The foaming performance is characterized by its expansion ratio (ER) and half-life (H-L), which are defined as the maximum increase in volume relative to the original asphalt volume and the time in seconds that the asphalt foam requires to collapse from maximum expansion to half of maximum expansion, respectively.&nbsp; Through the foaming evolution diagram of the foamed asphalt, the foaming characteristics can be easily determined. &nbsp;It was found that the water-based foamed asphalt has a much higher volume expansion ratio (Figure 3(b)) than the ethanol-based foamed asphalt does (Figure 3(b)).</p>\n<p>The viscosities of the foamed asphalt at different temperatures were measured by the Bohlin Gemini Rheometer via temperature sweep mode. &nbsp;The measured viscosities of the foamed asphalts with different foaming agents (water and ethanol) are shown in Figure 4. &nbsp;It shows that (1) as temperature of the foamed asphalt samples increase, the viscosity of the samples decreases exponentially, and (2) the viscosity of the foamed asphalt is inversely proportional to the water content in the samples. By comparing the volume expansion and viscosity of the foamed asphalt with different foaming agent (water and ethanol), it is found that the viscosity of the ethanol-based foamed asphalt is considerably smaller than that of the water-based foamed asphalt, which implies better workability.</p>\n<p>A numerical simulation model (Figure 5) using the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been developed to investigate the asphalt foaming processes of the foamed asphalt. In this simulation, bubbles in foamed asphalt rise through the interaction of buoyancy force and drag force. Once the bubbles in the foamed asphalt begin to collapse, the gas bubbles whose pressure is lower than the mean asphalt pressure are collapsed at a given decreasing frequency. The pressure in the function chamber is calculated based on the SPH model, i.e. based on density through the equation of state. The numerical model was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental ones. Parametric studies were further conducted by using the numerical model to evaluate the effects of environmental controlling parameters on the foaming characteristics of the foamed asphalt binder.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we discover that the ethanol based foaming process cannot produce comparable amount of bubbles as the water-based foaming process but may provide comparable or better workability, which is more important to the asphalt production. The SPH based simulation can capture the thermodynamics of the phase change and bubble motion during the foaming process. We need to validate it through more field tests and pilot projects in future research and development.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Huiming&nbsp;Yin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826040629_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826040629_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826040629_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Laboratory self-developed foamer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">yes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiming&nbsp;Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826189533_FIg.2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826189533_FIg.2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476826189533_FIg.2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Foaming characterization with the high-speed long range Laser Displacement Sensor (LDS)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">yes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiming&nbsp;Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476830199749_Fig.3_foamingevolutionhistory--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476830199749_Fig.3_foamingevolutionhistory--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476830199749_Fig.3_foamingevolutionhistory--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Foaming evolution history of the foamed asphalt</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">yes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiming&nbsp;Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476888836461_FIg.4viscosity--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476888836461_FIg.4viscosity--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476888836461_FIg.4viscosity--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Viscosity of the foamed asphalt with water and ethanol</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">yes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiming&nbsp;Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476893115459_FIg.5.simulationmodel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476893115459_FIg.5.simulationmodel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1301160/1301160_10265755_1476893115459_FIg.5.simulationmodel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Simulation snapshot of the collapsing process of the foamed asphalt</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">yes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiming&nbsp;Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
