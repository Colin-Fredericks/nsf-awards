 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the research project is to provide statisticians and biological scientists new and improved statistical tools for measuring variable importance and selecting key variables in high-dimensional biological data.  The two major ingredients underlying the research are a distance-based procedure across multiple dimensions and a tilting/weighting-based importance measure for any specific dimension. The distance-based methods, e.g., the multi-response permutation procedure and the distance covariance, provide the ability to handle data even if the number of dimensions is larger than the sample size.  The tilting/weighting-based procedures allow variable importance to be evaluated for any dimension in the presence of any number of other variables. Thus, variable importance is evaluated in the multivariate context rather than on univariate marginal distributions.  In addition, the new methods will allow the number of selected variables to exceed the sample size; allow forward selection, backward selection, and sparse penalized weighting; minimize perturbation to the dependence structures actually present in the data; require minimal structural assumptions; and be sensitive to a wide range of multivariate dependencies, including some difficult or even impossible to detect with existing methods.\r\n\r\nThe methods developed as part of this project have a wide range of applications in biomedical and agricultural industries.  Modern genomics tools allow researchers to simultaneously measure thousands of variables that contain information about DNA, RNA, and protein characteristics of organisms.  The high-dimensional data generated by these modern high-throughput technologies must be mined to identify the variables that are most associated with health outcomes or other important traits.  Uncovering of such associations is crucial in a variety of areas including drug discovery, genetic risk analysis, personalized medicine, and plant and animal breeding. This research project will provide tools to help make these discoveries possible.  Reliable software implementations of the new methods will be created, maintained, archived in public repositories, and freely disseminated to genomics researchers and industry practitioners working with a diverse range of organisms and different high-throughput technologies.  The research activity will enhance collaborations and partnerships among researchers from both computational/statistical fields and experimental/biomedical fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern technologies allow researchers to measure many variables simultaneously for each experimental unit or observational unit under investigation.  When units can be partitioned into two or more groups based on treatments applied to units or based on characteristics of the units, a common goal is to understand specifically which subset of the measured variables has a multivariate distribution that differs among groups.  This project has led to the development of a new method for identifying subsets of important variables. \n\nMost previously existing approaches for addressing this problem attempt to discover interesting variables by studying data for each variable individually. In contrast, the proposed approach capitalizes on information contained in multivariate distributions that cannot be seen when focusing separately on each individual variable in turn.  In applications to problems in genetics, where researchers attempt to learn the functions of genes in biological systems by measuring their transcript abundance levels, the newly developed method exhibits an improved ability to uncover important genes relative to previously existing approaches.  \n\nAnother advantage of the method developed in this research project is its applicability to problems that involve more variables than experimental or observational units.  The proposed approach begins by considering all variables simultaneously and removing unimportant variables until the key subset of variables remains.  This so-called backward selection strategy is not possible for traditional multivariate approaches when the number of variables exceeds the sample size.  The proposed approach overcomes the difficulty of sample size smaller than the number of variables and has been incorporated into a new testing procedure for identifying differences among groups in high-dimensional multivariate distributions.  By applying the backward variable selection procedure prior to conducting a test for multivariate distributional differences, the proposed approach focuses the power of the test on the subset of important dimensions to make possible discoveries that might otherwise be obscured by many measured variables that contain no interesting signals.\n\nThe project has led to the development of two statistical software packages: one for realistic simulation of multivariate data in gene expression studies and one for implementing nonparametric multivariate testing and backward selection.  These packages will help other researchers simulate realistic data to permit relevant comparisons of methods and will also help data analysts make use of the newly developed method for identifying important variables in a wide variety of applications.\n\nIn addition to the development of a new statistical method for identifying important variables and the creation of useful software packages, this funded research project has provided interdisciplinary training to two statistics graduate students.  These students were able to combine their formal training in statistics with applications in molecular biology.  Furthermore, these students gained valuable experience with high-performance computing environments and statistical and computational methods development.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel S Nettleton"
