 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Science Research Center at San Diego State University (SDSU) is awarding $10,000 per year scholarships to 26 graduate students in interdisciplinary computational science and engineering areas.  Over the course of this 4 year project, SDSU is awarding support to 16 PhD students, in unique cohorts of four to six students, during their first two years of study, and these doctoral candidates are being supported as research assistants in subsequent years.  In addition, 10 Master's students, in unique cohorts of 3 or 4 students per year, are supported each year of their two-year degree program.\r\n\r\nThe project is ensuring the development of a future workforce with high level problem solving skills and experience to work on interdisciplinary computational science and engineering problems in team settings.  The project is engaging and training the cohorts of graduate students in 'discovery teams' which include professors, research staff, graduate and undergraduate students, working interactively to solve practical problems.  S-STEM scholars are being supported through to degree completion via strategic academic and career counseling, appropriate and timely course support as needed, guidance on seeking additional graduate study financial support, networking opportunities with researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry, and enhanced teaching, outreach, and leadership training.\r\n\r\nThe project is increasing the diversity of graduate students in interdisciplinary computational science graduate program and is increasing the number of women and socioeconomically disadvantaged students who complete graduate level STEM-programs and obtain private sector or academic appointments in interdisciplinary computational science and engineering fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Interdisciplinary Computational Science and Engineering Research Training (ICSERT) Program received funding from 2013 - 2019 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) SSTEM program (Award No. 125995).\n\nThe purpose of the program was to increase the number of women and underrepresented socioeconomically disadvantaged students who complete graduate-level STEM programs and obtain private sector or academic appointments in interdisciplinary computational science and engineering fields. A critical goal of the ICSERT program was to provide opportunities for interdisciplinary team based research experiences for each Scholar. As such, in addition to mentorship from the project leadership, each scholar was matched with a faculty mentor in their discipline, who aided in the development of the scholar\u2019s competence at research via hands-on research projects in the mentor\u2019s lab. In such environments, ICSERT scholars often also served as peer role models for the undergraduate students also working in their mentor\u2019s research labs. Scholars were provided training and opportunities to participate in intramural research presentations such as the SDSU\u2019s annual Student Research Symposium (SRS), Student Research Conferences and professional conferences in their respective disciplines (e.g., AIAA, APS, SIAM, ABRCMS).\n\nICSERT scholars also attended the Computational Science Research Center\u2019s annual Applied Computational Science and Engineering Student Support (ACSESS) event, where they were introduced to and networked with of eminent computational scientists from government national labs and industry.

This lecture series provided exposure to a wide range of interdisciplinary topics for SSTEM students to learn from, enabling scholars to further develop their research interests and professional goals. \n\nAs a result of the ICSERT activities, the graduate program enjoyed a more diverse student population relative to previous cohorts. The gender of the ICSERT students (31% women) represents a modest improvement towards gender parity relative to the pre-existing demographics at the outset of the project for the Engineering and Computational Science graduate programs (29% women).  Further, ICSERT students represent a more racially diverse student population (19% Underrepresented minority [URM]) relative to the pre-existing demographics at the outset of the project for the Engineering and Computational Science graduate programs (03% URM).  The success of ICSERT activities is also demonstrated through a high retention rate of SSTEM scholars (88%), representing a significant improvement over national Doctoral attrition rates ranging from 45.3% in mathematics and physical sciences, to 36.4% in engineering.  And while acknowledging the small scale of a 32 student scholarship program, the increased diversity in the student population and perfect placement rate of graduates into jobs (100%) also translates to a contribution to national efforts to increase diversity in academic and industry careers.\n\nThe scholars also evaluated the ICSERT program as highly beneficial.  All students (100%) reported that the ICSERT program had a positive impact on their graduate studies.  The majority of students (53%) agreed that the ICSERT program was \"extremely positive\".  93% rated the financial support as extremely useful, while 07% rated the financial support as moderately useful. 87% agreed or strongly agreed that the ICSERT program gave them greater access to mentorship.  87% at least somewhat agreed that the ICSERT facilitated relationship building with their peers.
