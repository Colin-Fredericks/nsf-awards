 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and Cellular Dynamics and Function Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and by the Division of Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and also by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems in the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nEpigenetic modifications to the DNA and protein components of chromatin are important determinants of gene expression, and dynamic epigenetic changes are thought to underlie the ability of organisms to rapidly respond to environmental perturbations. Much of what is understood about such regulation has been obtained through so-called ensemble approaches, which determine epigenetic modifications from cells isolated from mixed tissue types; thus, the data represent an average of epigenetic and gene expression profiles of multiple cells. Recent technical advances have made it possible to obtain DNA sequence information and gene expression profiles for single cells, but it is not yet possible to obtain epigenetic information from single cells. The ability to monitor dynamic epigenetic profiles in single cells would revolutionize the field of epigenetics by enabling hitherto impossible studies of stochasticity, stability, and heritability of epigenetic responses. This project seeks to develop and implement an innovative pipeline for controlled hormone and stress perturbation of plant cells, followed by single-cell analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. An integrated micro- and nano-fluidic device will be built to enable single-cell isolation from specific cell types and subsequent chromatin sorting. Then DNA methylation information will be extracted from the isolated cells via new kinetic analysis of real-time sequencing data produced by ultrasensitive FRET-based single molecule sequencing. If successful, this new technology will enable analysis of epigenomic profiles of single cells, thus making it possible to address fundamental questions about epigenetic regulation in a revolutionary new way, not only in plants, but also in mammalian and microbial cells.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific impact, the project will have broad educational impacts by offering opportunities for cross-disciplinary training at the interfaces of molecular biology and nano-engineering.  Postdoctoral and graduate students will be involved directly in carrying out the research, and the technology developed in the project will be incorporated into hands-on laboratory training modules for both graduate and undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n With the revolution of genomics technologies, our understanding and engineering abilities of living systems have greatly improved.  Today scientists are interested to investigate a complex biological system by analyzing its basic units: individual single cells.  Analysis with single-cell resolution provides unique insight because biological systems are complex and inhomogeneous and often times the rare cells such as stem cells can play critical roles in key biological processes in plants and animals.  Our research addresses several key aspects of single cell technologies both at the cellular and genomic levels.\n\nAt the cellular level, one key challenge has been lack of precise and efficient method to detect and isolate those individual cells of special interest (i.e. the significant minorities) from a large mixture of cell types and populations.  Without an effective solution, scientists waste a large amount of time and resource to analyze cells that contain very limited useful information.  Our research has fundamentally solved this bottleneck problem by producing the world?s first imaging-based flow cytometer cell sorter (Fig. 1).  The image-based cell sorter allows isolation of individual cells based on their morphological features and biological markers, allowing scientists to select their cell targets for downstream analysis with unprecedented efficiency and precision.\n\nBroader Impact\n\n The research program has led to several key publications and conference papers to help dissemination of the information to the general scientific communities, especially the communities of life sciences and engineering.  It has contributed to the promotion of multidisciplinary research and the education of graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research environments.  The projects have offered REU opportunities to 2 female undergraduates and helped their graduate school application.  The projects also contributed to the RET program with high school science teachers to help implement new science curricula to high school classroom.  Some of the research results have also been incorporated into the Talented Youth program in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, with the UCSD group hosting a one-day science program for 25 high school students interested in STEM careers. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.
