 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, studies of micro-extrusion of pastes through high aspect ratio (HAR) micro-nozzles to fabricate multi-material, multi-layer (M3L) devices will be conducted. The capability for layer-by-layer fabrication with composition variation within each layer will be investigated. To provide unmatched capability for fabricating novel architecture of M3L devices not achievable today, extrusion behavior of various sizes of HAR micro-nozzles starting from millimeters all the way down to 25 micrometers will be studied. Novel three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors with high energy densities will be used as a model system to investigate the challenges of the M3L technology. As such, extensive efforts will be made to study and establish the proper formulations of the desired pastes that can be micro-extruded using HAR micro-nozzles and have pseudoplastic characteristics to form a large layer with the desired thickness and a uniform composition. The 3D supercapacitors fabricated will be characterized structurally and electro-chemically to demonstrate the unmatched power of the M3L technology in fabricating durable, low cost, high performance devices.\r\n\r\nM3L technology will reduce part count, part handling, part transportation and part storage because only one processing step is needed. Furthermore, the M3L technology will offer new manufacturing capabilities to produce M3L devices with the composition control locally at the micrometer level for the desired functionalities and the dimension control spanning over 5 orders of magnitude for high fabrication rates. It is expected that the M3L technology proposed can compete with conventional manufacturing methods for cost effectiveness, not to mention that the M3L technology can fabricate novel devices with new functionalities, not achievable via today's manufacturing technology. This project will have a substantial impact on manufacturing technology. It can greatly improve productivity, reduce the production cost, and enhance the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. This project will also provide an excellent education and training opportunity to one graduate student and many undergraduate students in the areas of manufacturing and alternative energy.",

The advantage of HAR nozzles over the circular nozzles widely used today in additive manufacturing is their ability to deposit a single layer in one micro-extrusion operation, whereas several-hundred printing operations are needed to create a layer if circular nozzles are used. Figure 1 compares a plane with an area of 32 x 30 cm<sup>2</sup> micro-extruded using a circular nozzle versus using a HAR nozzle. It can be seen that 150 micro-extrusion operations are required to deposit the plane for the circular nozzle machine, whereas only three micro-extrusion operations are needed using the HAR nozzle machine. As such, fabrication productivity has been increased by 50 times in this particular case. Conventional manufacturing methods in making multi-material, multi-layer devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells, multi-layer ceramic capacitors, resistor-capacitor, inductor-capacitor, and varistor-capacitor multilayer combinations, are tape casting followed by cutting, punching, stacking, binder burnout, and sintering. When compared with conventional manufacturing methods, additive manufacturing using HAR nozzles can eliminate cutting, punching and stacking operations and at the same time reduce part count, part handling, part transportation and part storage because only one fabrication step is needed.

A quantitative formulation has been developed to link the quality of micro-extruded layer(s) to each of these micro-extrusion parameters. Three key issues encountered in micro-extrusion using HAR nozzles have been revealed: (i) under-filling and over-filling, (ii) transition regions at the beginning, ending and sharp turns, and (iii) air bubbles trapped in extrudates.

Specifically, we have worked with ASM International Chicago Chapter for the last three years to provide introductions and lab tours to middle/high school teachers during the ASM International Summer Teacher Camps in Chicago.
