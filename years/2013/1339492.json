 "awd_abstract_narration": "IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI): from Nano to Macro Student Travel Awards 2013, PI: Bahram Parvin, U.C. Riverside\r\n\r\nThe project provides NSF Student Travel Fellowships to graduate students and Ph.D. candidates  in computational bioimaging or closely related areas to attend and participate in the 2013 ISBI conference  organized jointly by the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology (EMB) in San Francisco, California from April 7 to 11, 2013.  ISBI emphasizes methodologies that have the potential to be applicable to multiple imaging modalities and to imaging at different scales. Topics include multi-scale physiological analysis and modeling of biological processes.  The meeting aims to facilitate cross fertilization of computational techniques between different imaging modalities and scales, with applications ranging from the nano and molecular imaging, via electron and optical microscopy, to macroscopic imaging via small animal imagers and whole body clinical systems. Special efforts will be made to attract women and members of groups that are underrepresented within image-based modeling of biological systems and integrative biology. The NSF student travel award recipients will be able to attend the plenary and contributed talks, grand challenges and tutorials that are part of ISBI 2013 as well as interactions with leading researchers in the world.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging provides a forum where top-notch students interact with leaders in the field and engage in intellectual discussions with other superlative students in a wide array of bio-imaging and related disciplines. Students are able to view presentations on topics related to their own fields of academic study and to participate in didactic interactions. Without the NSF support, many students would be less likely to attend the conference, thus missing an introduction to the world of knowledge available at such professional meetings. In addition, the meeting provides a forum for recognizing the talents of women and minorities in the field of multi-scale image-based modeling and bioengineering. Ultimately, the forum provides the means for Graduate students and Ph.D. candidates to improve the quality of dissertation research and make better informed decisions for advancing their career objectives.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:   The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging promotes not only education within the image-based modeling and visualization of biological systems, but fosters the next generation engineers, modelers, and computer scientists by providing a unique opportunity for the students to meet and network with the leading scientists in the world. It also provides students an opportunity to participate in grand challenges and to learn about the state of art computational methods for solving complex problems in image-based modeling and analysis, and hypothesis generation from \"big data\", which are being generated through several national initiatives. For the first time, ISBI is enjoying a rapid growth in grand challenges, and this process will be an extraordinary exposure for students. Grand challenges set the bar for performance and elicit technological advancement and sophistication for the next generation researchers.",
