The 2011 NRC study developed a strategic vision for NSF-supported Antarctic research. This activity will build on this vision and use community-based workshops to identify a prioritized suite of science questions that the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) can use as a roadmap to guide the science support infrastructure needed to support to advance high priority science in the Antarctic. The proposed study will provide NSF with guidance on research priorities, fundamental observations, and essential infrastructure for the coming decade, aligned with reasonable expectations for the level of resources likely to be available. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nNSF?s investments in the USAP have the ability to advance high priority research questions in fields spanning astrophysics and geospace sciences, biology, ecology, geology and geophysics, glaciology, ocean and lower atmosphere, integrated systems, and climate science. The proposed study will help ensure that these investments are made as strategically and effectively as possible. Ultimately, this research will benefit decision makers and society by providing a sound foundation of scientific knowledge to help the importance of the Antarctic as a driving force in earth systems.",
