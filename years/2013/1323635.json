It is expanding a prototype system to cover topics in a traditional two-semester linear circuits course. The system can generate circuit problems with random topologies and element values for DC, steady-state AC, and transient circuits; allowing students to study concepts related to Fourier analysis, Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and three-phase circuits. Problem solutions are produced using a variety of special pedagogical features, including exercises designed to correct common student misconceptions. The system accepts a rich variety of inputs such as equations, re-drawn circuit diagrams, waveform sketches, matrix equations, as well as conventional numerical and multiple-choice answers. \r\n\r\nThe web-based system is being employed and evaluated in a variety of ways in linear circuit classes at ASU, UVA, ND, and UOP. Dr. Daniel Robinson (at CSU) is conducting rigorous evaluation and analysis of the resulting qualitative and quantitative student learning data collected at these institutions. Through testing the software system in a variety of public and private schools, the team is demonstrating that the system can provide rapid feedback to instructors and enhance student learning - in areas that students have the most difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE \r\nThe project is directly impacting more than 4300 students and having a significant effect on engineering education, since many engineering students in various disciplines take circuits courses. It is also expected that the system will be highly suitable for incorporation into massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) addressing this subject area. Student engagement is being increased through the use of interactive exercises that provide rapid feedback to students at each step of a problem. The team is also developing a tutorial authoring interface and execution engine that allows tutorial writers (e.g., instructors) to design more effective tutoring sequences by using the features of the circuit generation and solution modules. The approach is adaptable to other subject areas in electrical engineering, as well as other engineering disciplines. Some of the simpler tutorials and modules on basic circuit properties are being made available to high school students and the general public via a website designed for that purpose.",
