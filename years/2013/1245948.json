 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing and assessing mobile-based learning games for introductory geoscience courses based on geological features of the Grand Canyon. Using smartphones with geo-referencing capability, students physically navigate a scaled version of the virtual landscape, observing, collecting data and solving problems based on field photographs, maps and other information, with scoring and rewards native to the gaming environment. Student use provides a large dataset to assess student learning and game design. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its innovative approach to leveraging recent technological and educational advances to improve learning and engagement of the current generation of students who take introductory geoscience courses, particularly where real field trips are not possible. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the games to a wide range of institutions and student audiences. The educational research of the games' impact also offers insight into strategies for effective use of mobile-based games in the geosciences.",

In the case of the geosciences, a primary contributor is that college-level introductory courses simply fail to inspire most students. It is clear from previous studies that field trips are often the most impactful component of geoscience courses, and it is frequently hands-on field experiences that draw students into a geoscience career. Yet, introductory geoscience courses are typically taught in the traditional form of a lecture and a complementary lab, and are commonly large enrollment sections.
