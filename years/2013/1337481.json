 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Erich Uffelman from Washington & Lee University and colleagues Alison Bell, Donald Gaylord, Patricia Hobbs and Ronald Fuchs will acquire a fiber optic reflectance spectrometer (FORS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as analyses of cultural heritage objects as well as geological studies of weathering and topographical change in the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nA reflectance spectrometer measures the radiation of the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected by different materials. The spectrometer can gather data on ultraviolet (UV) light and infrared (IR) radiation in addition to the visible ranges. It is commonly used to study minerals, planetary surfaces and in this case to analyze and screen cultural heritage objects such as paintings, porcelain and other museum-quality artifacts to aid in the preservation efforts. This instrument will be used for research and also in educational activities.",
