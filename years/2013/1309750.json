 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:  The proposed research seeks to develop a new type of graphene photodetector that operates at room temperature and exploits plasmonic resonances to achieve tunable spectral sensitivity throughout the terahertz spectral regime.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Graphene is a unique two-dimensional material that has the potential to transform the field of terahertz and infrared photonics.  Favorable thermoelectric transport properties, including low specific heat and weak electron-phonon interaction allow for sensitive detection and ultrafast response time in graphene devices.  While a single layer of graphene can yield a small, but measurable photoabsorption, structured graphene films can support collective plasmonic excitations that show a far greater photoabsorption, at a resonance frequency that can be electrically tuned through the application of a gate voltage.  The device concept proposed here could lead to a transformative advances in terahertz photonics, by enabling tunable room-temperature sensitivity and noise performance that is orders of magnitude superior to existing detector technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Practical room temperature terahertz photodetection could have far reaching impact in a number of key sectors ranging from pharmaceutical development to homeland security and medical imaging, and could spur the development of a robust terahertz technology. Furthermore, we propose a new outreach activity that would introduce young scientists from developing countries to new economical techniques for advanced signal recovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen a conductor is illuminated with light, its electrons can oscillate in collective motion called a plasmon resonance. In metals, these plasmons occur at visible light frequencies, but in graphene the motion happens at much slower terahertz frequencies, and the resonant frequency can be tuned by applying a voltage.  Graphene plasmonics has the potential to revolutionize terahertz technology &ndash; the last great underdeveloped frequency band of E&amp;M waves.  Tunable graphene plasmonic resonators have been suggested for use in terahertz filters, modulators, detectors, and emitters, and could find widespread applications in science, medicine, security, and communications.\n\nDuring this project, our team has make key technological advances and fundamental discoveries in the development of graphene-based plasmonic devices.  Namely, we have shown that the photothermoelectric effect in graphene can be used to efficiently detect radiation across a very broad optical wavelength range (from visible to terahertz.)  This principle was also applied to an emerging two-dimensional material, black phosphorus.  Further, we have shown that tunable plasmon resonances can be used to increase the absorption efficiency in graphene devices, especially in the terahertz frequency band. \n\nWhen electrons in graphene are excited or heated by an optical pulse, they soon thereafter lose their energy and return to equilibrium.  The speed and processes by which excited electrons cool are crucial, because they limit the performance and speed of graphene-based optoelectronic devices and detectors.  We have developed new methods to observe and measure the cooling of electrons in graphene, using both spectroscopy as well as pulsed nonlinear terahertz measurements.  We have also applied these methods to graphene microstructures, which exhibit a characteristic plasmon resonance.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas E Murphy"
