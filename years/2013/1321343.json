 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Equitable Science Curriculum for integrating Arts in Public Education (ESCAPE) addresses a profound problem: science learning deficits among the growing population of elementary students who are non-native English speakers. Focusing on six high-need Southern California school districts, ESCAPE targets grade 3-5 English Language Learners (ELLs) in developing the academic language needed to understand scientific concepts. To address learning challenges posed by difficult scientific vocabulary, the project integrates the arts' more concrete strategies to illustrate the sciences' more abstract concepts, exploiting similarities between these disciplines' shared basis in crosscutting concepts like pattern, cause/effect, scale, proportion, and quantity. The grade 3-5 focus is crucial because comprehension at this level is pivotal to future achievement. Led by University of California-Irvine STEM faculty (with support from UCI's CalTeach preservice science teacher development program), the partnership includes teachers and administrators from the Orange County Department of Education and six school districts, WestEd educational consultants, and the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. ESCAPE expects to increase: 1) teacher content and pedagogical knowledge in Earth, Physical, and Life Science; 2) integration of arts to boost ELL learning; and 3) student achievement on science and language development tests.\r\n\r\nOver four years, each of 150 teachers receives 220 hours of team-based professional development in using science kits and illustrating science concepts through the arts. Program effectiveness is measured using a random assignment design. Principals in each of the six districts volunteer their schools for the project; within each district schools are randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Program effects on students' and teachers' science knowledge and achievement are measured by pre- and post-tests for students and teachers. The goal of the research is to measure the effect of the intervention on teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, as well as the effect on student science achievement.  Causal mechanisms are investigated, including how school and teacher characteristics modify the effects as well as differential effects on ELLs and native English speakers, and the mechanisms underlying these differential effects. The quantitative analyses is based on multilevel regression models, with students nested in classrooms (teachers) that are nested in schools, and accounting for a host of control variables. These methods provide unbiased estimates of program effects. Qualitative data include teacher implementation logs, feedback forms, and focus groups.\r\n\r\nESCAPE aims to provide sustainable teacher professional development that increases teachers' science content and pedagogical knowledge, while overcoming impediments to ELLs' STEM learning. Over the project's five years, 150 teachers will teach ~21,000 students, and ~180 CalTeach preservice teachers will be trained. Among the project's products is an ELL-accessible curriculum for Earth, Physical, and Life Science in grades 3-5 and a video-based online system for training teachers (providing a university Certificate in Teaching Science through the Arts), which will be deployed and tested with CalTeach pre-service teachers and teachers in Southern California school districts. This will assist in the national dissemination of this model for improving teacher and student achievement.",

Supported by supplementary funding, teachers voluntarily continued their implementation of the ESCAPE lesson plans, which are expected to continue to be used in classrooms well beyond the grant program?s experimental phase. Furthermore, all lesson plans, online course modules, videos, testing materials, and other resources have been posted online for continued classroom implementation at https://escape.uci.edu/ or in the future, long-term access to this project and others will be hosted on the Hughes Media site at https://hughesmedia.bio.uci.edu/.\nThrough the ESCAPE program's professional development activities and the subsequent classroom implementation of the ESCAPE lessons, large data sets were collected, cataloged, and analyzed, which included pre- and post- testing of teachers and students knowledge, implementation logs, evaluation surveys, and focus groups. The research findings indicate that:\n\n\nTeachers experienced significant gains (p&lt;0.0001) from pre- to post-test in their content and pedagogical knowledge in earth, life, &amp; physical science;\n\n\nSTEM NGSS units and STEAM NGSS+Arts units both significantly increased student science knowledge, and the combined effect of integrating them significantly increased learning;\n\n\nThe order of implementation STEAM NGSS+Arts before STEM NGSS leads to significantly higher gains in achievement for all students, particularly closing learning gaps for ELLs;\n\n\nArts-integrated approaches can correct misconceptions in science for all populations, and most substantially for ELLs;\n\n\nThe high average total program evaluation score of 90.1% garnered the ESCAPE online course the official Quality Matters Certification during the first quarter of implementation, further validating the study of the ESCAPE program to inform decisions about how online courses can be designed and evaluated in order to promote the quality and continuous improvement of online professional development.\n\n\nThe ESCAPE research initiated an exploration into the efficacy of arts \napproaches when integrated with STEM disciplines. The ESCAPE program shows great promise in making arts and science education more accessible to students, increasing student achievement, and correcting science misconceptions. Additionally, these results have implications for how arts-integrated strategies might best be designed and implemented across classrooms, schools, and districts to teach science. ESCAPE online provides a highly interactive learning experience for teachers that can continue to evolve with new technologies. ESCAPE is a rigorous long-term study with great promise for continued development in the future, and thanks to it?s online sustainables content it?s opening up new frontiers for STEAM research. The ESCAPE vision is moving into the future with new research and developments in virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital storytelling to support learning STEM for all with STEAM.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradley S Hughes"
