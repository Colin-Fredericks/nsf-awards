 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program (A) of the Division of Chemistry, the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Physics of Living Systems Program of the Division of Physics, Prof. Paul M. Champion at Northeastern University will use modern, ultrafast laser methods to study the ways in which biomolecular systems use thermal energy to carry out and control biochemical reactions.  In particular, Prof. Champion and his research group will use vibrational coherence spectroscopy (VCS) and femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering (FSRS) will be used to probe the ways in which low-frequency vibrations of complex biomolecules influence or modify the reactivity of large biomolecules.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the chemical reactivity of biomolecular systems is critical towards understanding the way that biological systems operate at the macroscopic scale.  Advances in this field will yield advances in medicine and biotechnology.  The undergraduate and graduate students working with Prof. Champion will receive excellent training in cutting-edge science at the intersection of Biology and the Physical Sciences.  Prof. Champion is also actively collaborating with scientists from underrepresented groups at Northeastern as well as in Puerto Rico.",
