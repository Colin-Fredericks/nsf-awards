 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves post-processing of original field data collected as part of the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Study (DC3) conducted in May and June of 2012. The primary goal of the DC3 campaign was to determine the influence of deep, midlatitude continental convective clouds, including related dynamical, physical, and lightning processes, on upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UT/LS) composition and chemistry. In the UT/LS, formaldehyde and peroxides are major sources of ozone. Careful analyses of the DC3 dataset are important for understanding and interpreting radical production in the UT/LS due to convective transport of precursors that influence the production of ozone. \r\n\r\nData from the DC3 campaign will increase the understanding of the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics related to the formation of ozone in the upper troposphere, where ozone acts as a greenhouse gas.  Detailed analysis of campaign data will help elucidate possible mechanisms that occur during deep convection and plume aging that influence water vapor, ozone, cirrus cloud and aerosol concentrations that all play important roles in contributing to radiative forcing of the Earth's climate system.",
