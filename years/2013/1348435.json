Its Early Career Symposia provide an avenue for early career scholars to receive mentoring from established researchers.\r\n\r\nThis project supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from U.S. universities to attend the Annual Meeting and Early Career Symposium. Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding agencies and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the Symposium is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that technology can transform teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThis activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. This conference is one among many that researchers in the cyberlearning community regularly attend. Mentors come from the AECT community as well as from the learning sciences community.",

Due to the success of the previous three symposia, AECT continued this effort for another cadre' of scholars. This symposium provided an avenue for early career scholars to receive mentoring from established researchers.  The NSF AECT Early Career Symposium took place at the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) Annual International Convention in Anaheim, California on October 29-30, 2013.\n\nThe Early Career Symposium was built from our observation that synergistic collaborations are one of the fundamental elements for sparking innovative research endeavors. After all, good ideas are stimulated by conversations with others who share interests. The Early Career Symposium created these conversations in a way that was supportive across all stages of career growth.\n\nThe intended outcomes of the Early Career Symposium included:\n\nmentoring of advanced doctoral      students into the social/professional network as partners in idea-making\nsupporting advanced doctoral      students and early career faculty in developing viable technology-oriented      research agendas\nproviding specific feedback and      guidance to advanced doctoral students and early career faculty about      their research agendas and to help them design, develop, and give a      presentation on a research proposal\nproviding information to advanced      doctoral students and early career faculty about building a research      agenda, pursuing funding, and building collaborations\ndeveloping a community of      researchers interested in ways technology can transform teaching and      learning\n\n\nSymposium Schedule\n\nTuesday-Day One\n\n8:30-9:00          Breakfast, Introductions &amp; Getting Started\n\n9:00-10:00       Poster Sessions\n\n10:00 -11:00  Panel Discussion 1: Creating a Research Agenda\n\n11:00-12:30   Follow-up Discussion with Mentor\n\n12:30-2:00       Working Lunch w/Mentor\n\n2:00-3:00          Participant Individual Work Time, Consultation time with Mentors\n\n3:00-4:00          Panel Discussion 2: Securing Funding for your Work\n\n4:00-5:00          Follow-up Discussion with Mentor\n\nWednesday - Day Two\n\n8:30-8:45          Breakfast\n\n8:45-9:30          Advanced Doctoral Student Final Poster Sessions\n\n9:30-10:30       Panel Discussion 3: General Strategies for Success \n\n10:30-11:00   Small Group Discussion\n\n11:00-11:45   Early Career Faculty Poster Presentations\n\n11:45-Noon      Closing\n\nEvaluation\n\nSix early career faculty and six advanced doctoral students were grouped with six mid-career or senior mentors.  Participants were satisfied with the symposium and gained valuable information on how to construct a technology-oriented research agenda, how to apply for research project funding, as well as how to be productive as an academic professional. \n\nMentoring themes resulting from the symposium included:\n\nDevelop a Clear Research Agenda\nConduct Research that has a Broader Impact on the World\nNetwork and Collaborate with Established Scholars\nPublicize Research Agenda and Ideas  \nDesign Interdisciplinary Research Projects\nBe Consistent about Writing.  \nSet Priorities\nFind Balance \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jozenia Colorado"
