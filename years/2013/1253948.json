 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-linearities abound in any complex biomechanical simulation. As a human hand folds into a fist, non-linear contact and material forces give rise to characteristic bulges and folds. As red blood cells crowd down a capillary, advection and contact non-linearities cause them to bump and twirl. These essential dynamics are also the main computational challenges in a simulation.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the efficient simulation of these and other biomechanical non-linearities. It specifically investigates projected physics methods, also known as model reduction methods, which have been known to accelerate simulations by multiple orders of magnitude, but also have trouble incorporating arbitrary non-linearities. The research team explores a variety of promising approaches, including multidimensional cubature, exponential integrators, and vector partitioning. Source code is routinely released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nThe project is driven by two main applications. The first is high-quality, virtual humans, which can be used in surgical simulation and training, as well as visual media. The second is simulating flexible micro-particles in blood flow, which assists in designing effective shapes that deliver radiation payloads to cancer sites. The visual results of this research are highly accessible to non-specialists, so they are packaged into a publicly available app that is used to engage undergraduate researchers, and used during high school outreach to encourage involvement in science and engineering.",

One of the most challenging non-linearities when simulating humans are self-contact non-linearities, e.g. when an elbow presses against a torso, or the head presses against the shoulder.

One of the drawbacks of the projected physics approach that we leveraged in this project is that it can consume large amounts of memory.

The problem of robustly coupling solids and fluids, i.e. red blood cells and surrounding plasma flow, introduced significant challenges to the projected physics framework. As a first step towards addressing these challenges, we developed a new, unified &ldquo;Eulerian&rdquo; method for simulating solids and fluids that are coupled in the same simulation. This new unified approach points the way forward to a fast projected physics algorithm that is able to handle all the non-linearities that arise in solids and fluids simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the suite of methods that was developed during the course of this project represent the state-of-the-art in fast physics simulations. One unforeseen implication of this work is that it also represents a stepping-stone to even faster machine learning-based approaches to physical simulation in the future. While we developed methods to handle non-linearities, they were all within the context of a &ldquo;linear basis&rdquo;, i.e. all the results were linear combinations of existing physical configurations. The natural next step is to use a &ldquo;non-linear basis&rdquo;, which introduces both more representational power, but new computational challenges as well.</p>\n<p>This grant supported 3 PhD students and two MS students.
