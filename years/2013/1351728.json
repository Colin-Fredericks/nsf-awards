Under the theoretical frameworks of social constructivism and culturally relevant pedagogy, this study will use a phenomenographic approach to explore the ways that Navajo students and Navajo professionals experience engineering design in the context of their culture, and a design-based research approach  to apply the results from the phenomenography in the iterative development of culturally-contextualized engineering curricula. \r\n\r\nWith the focus on engineering in the Next Generation Science Standards, the results of this study will provide critical insight into how to engage and evaluate Navajo students in culturally-contextualized engineering design curricula, which will illuminate pathways for higher education and careers in STEM fields.",

Results have informed the design of ten culturally relevant engineering design lessons that teach Navajo culture and engineering design together in a holistic way. Curriculum modules included (1) Future Chapter Presidents, in which students designed a future vision for their communities; (2) Identifying and Solving a Problem, in which students use the Din&eacute; engineering design process to develop solutions; (3) Intro to the Engineering Profession, which introduces engineering through the lens of stories from professional Navajo engineers; (4) Solving a Problem with the Scientific Method and the Din&#1104; Engineering Design Process; (5) Size of the Sacred Mountains: A Lesson in Scale and Proportion; (6) The Great Animal Escape: Portable Livestock Corral Design Project; (7) Culture and Geometry of the Hogan (a traditional Navajo dwelling); (8) Hogan Heat Transfer; (9) Illuminating the Great Seal of the Navajo Nation, which teaches both the symbology behind the Navajo Nation Seal and basic electrical circuit concepts; and (10) Bringing Electricity to the Remote Hogan, which teaches students how to design a solar energy system. These curricula aligned with the Din&eacute; Culture Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards have been piloted in multiple middle school STEM classrooms across the Navajo Nation, and were shown through external evaluation to be effective in helping Navajo students engage in STEM content in a culturally responsive way. The results of this study provide critical insight into how to engage Navajo students in engineering design in a way complementary to their culture. This foundation will support future educational innovations and illuminate pathways for Navajo students to pursue higher education and careers in STEM.
