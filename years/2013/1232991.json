 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) in the marine environment is an important research area within the context of global change that motivates the International GEOTRACES program. Some trace elements are known to play potentially important roles as micronutrients in biological cycling, particularly in regard to enzymatic and catalytic processes in the marine environment. Radioisotopes, transient tracers, and noble gases are valuable tracers of these and related processes, and of the ocean?s interaction with the atmosphere and the solid earth, which in turn play a role in shaping many trace element distributions within the ocean.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the GEOTRACES Science Plan, the guiding mission of the GEOTRACES program is \"to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean\".  The key observational strategy for GEOTRACES is an internationally-coordinated global-scale ocean survey of key TEIs. The second US GEOTRACES section, set for the Eastern South Pacific in 2013, is aimed at the characterization of key processes in an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), as well as a major abyssal hydrothermal plume extending westward from the East Pacific Rise. \r\n\r\nTo help achieve these goals, with support from this grant, a research team at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will collaborate with other GEOTRACES investigators on the Eastern South Pacific expedition to measure a suite of tracers useful for interpreting the rest of the synoptic TEI data.  Specifically, the team will make measurements of the noble gases, helium isotopes, tritium, and radiocarbon include in order to: (1) quantify ventilation, circulation, and diapycnal mixing in the OMZ to enable estimation of fluxes and transformation rates of key TEIs; (2) determine upwelling rates in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) over a range of timescales to constrain the fluxes of biogeochemically important properties; (3) estimate hydrothermal fluxes of key TEIs using 3He as a flux gauge, and also use 3He as a measure of downstream dilution in the hydrothermal plume; (4) use radiocarbon to estimate abyssal remineralization rates for key TEIs; and (5) probe for evidence of off-axis contribution of hydrothermal processes to TEI distribution. The collective effort will allow marine geochemists to understand mechanistically and quantitatively how a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes join to determine the distribtuion of TEIs in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: It has been argued that anthropogenic influence on the global cycles of many elements is emerging as significant. As outlined in the International GEOTRACES Science Plan, the broader impacts of this activity include both an important \"baseline snapshot\" of the biogeochemical state of the oceanic environment, and a quantitative improvement in the characterization and understanding of important processes in the marine environment. Both of these build a foundation for improved models and quantitative predictions of the oceanic response and role in global change and climate, particularly with anthropogenic forcing. For example, recent evidence of \"ocean deoxygenation\" has profound implications for marine biologic response. In particular, the evolving state of marine OMZs represents an important biogeochemical \"climate canary\". A key benefit of diagnosing trace metal dynamics and response to changing redox conditions is the improvement in prognostic capabilities of coupled ocean-atmosphere biogeochemical models for global change.",

There is a mid-depth plume emanating from the East Pacific Rise (a mid-ocean ridge where seafloor spreading occurs) at the center of the section (also shown as dashed line on the inset map). It extends many thousands of kilometers westward. In fact, the distribution of dissolved iron (as measured by our colleagues on this cruise) shows a remarkably similar picture. Figure 2, taken from a published <em>Nature </em>paper, shows how tightly they correlate: except for Station 18, which lies directly above the injection site, the data fall on a straight line. This demonstrates that the hydrothermal dissolved iron is affected only by dilution away from the East Pacific Rise. In this way, we have determined the <em>ratio </em>of iron to <sup>3</sup>He in the hydrothermal effluent (the slope of the relationship in Figure 2), which allows us to compute the <strong><em>Global Hydrothermal Iron Flux </em></strong>of approximately 4 x 10<sup>9</sup> Moles per year. This number is important for establishingmoer its impact on global marine productivity.</p>\n<h1>The impact of the Peruvian Upwelling System</h1>\n<p>The Peruvian Upwelling System, a region of enhanced biological productivity fueled by deep-water nutrients brought up by wind-induced coastal upwelling, supports a regionally important fisheries industry.

Understanding in a quantitative way how the subsurface nutrient-rich source waters couple with the upwelling and how this consequently drives off-shore marine productivity is an important objective. The primary challenge is that variations in the driving forces for this upwelling system occur on a wide range of time-scales, spanning months to decades and longer.
