 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines environmental conflicts surrounding proposed and completed cases of dam removal in the northeastern United States, focusing in particular on the social dimensions of these conflicts.  Over the past several decades more than 900 mostly small dams in the United States have been removed due to increasing public concern over the safety of aging dams, an unwillingness to invest scarce resources in infrastructure repair, and a growing interest in restoring degraded ecosystems.  Despite a decade's worth of research on the legal, social, economic and cultural dimensions of dam removal, there remains a vital need for comprehensive research on the multiple facets of the dam removal process, particularly in cases that generate conflicts among state agencies, environmental advocacy groups and local communities.  The research asks the following questions.  What are the biophysical and social characteristics of locations targeted for dam removal?  What are the key technical, economic and environmental rationales driving dam removal processes?  How do scientific knowledge and cultural values shape the dam removal process and generate conflicts?  Considering debates on the origins of environmental conflicts and the way in which landscapes reflect cultural attitudes, the research sheds light on the shifting character of environmental politics in the United States as revealed through contestation over dam removal.  This study uses both quantitative and qualitative techniques, including geographic information system (GIS) technologies and semi-structured interviews, to analyze more than 100 dam removals in New England, creating a regional assessment that analyzes both the environmental and social dimensions of the removal process.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators anticipate that stakeholders, including government agencies, environmental groups, and community organizations, will use the results of this research to advance ongoing studies on watershed restoration and encourage more informed national dialogues on dam removal and ecological restoration.  This project will offer significant training and research opportunities for Dartmouth undergraduate students (particularly those participating in the Women in Science Program) in combined qualitative-quantitative methodologies.  The collaborative team of physical, geospatial, and social scientists will serve as an important template for future inter- and intra-disciplinary studies in geography and spatial sciences.",

The research spanned 3 &frac12; years, from 2013 to 2017, and involved interviews with over 40 different stakeholders, including state and Federal environmental officials, staff members of local and national non-profit organizations, and representatives of communities affected by dam removal projects. More than 180 dams have been removed in New England over the past two decades with another 50 having been considered for removal (see Figure). Of these completed and proposed removals, roughly 30 percent have been contested by local communities who have been opposed to removal for historical, aesthetic, and/or environmental reasons. The results of our research have been circulated through multiple lectures and conference presentations, two book chapters, and five peer-reviewed journal articles. Our results can be broadly clustered around four themes: (1) dam removal is an increasingly important tool for river restoration that has significant and positive environmental outcomes; (2) the pathways to river restoration through dam removal are multiple and complex; (3) conflicts over dam removal are often the result of communities&rsquo; preferences to maintain cultural and historical landscapes even in the face of good economic and ecological rationales for removal; and (4) how scientific knowledge and expert claims&mdash;often contested in removal conflicts&mdash;are brought into restoration processes is a vital element of understanding the success or failure of dam removal initiatives.</p>\n<p>Our New England-based quantitative analysis reveals dam removal&rsquo;s ability to regenerate a suite of riverine processes including enhanced sediment connectivity, un-fragmented watersheds to allow fish passage, and the opening up of significant river length and important habitat for resident and diadromous fish.&nbsp; Our results point to the greater potential for re-connectivity at the watershed scale and, perhaps for enhanced watershed resilience. Dam removal can also result in increased watershed resilience&mdash;as evidenced by the opening up of critical upstream habitats for certain fish species&mdash;as it relates to large-scale and enduring anthropogenic changes (e.g., climate change).</p>\n<p>Dam removal in New England can often take multiple years and confronts a series of economic, political, regulatory, and technical challenges. &nbsp;Awareness<em> </em>of the numerous themes that characterize dam removal conflicts&mdash;historical and geographical contingencies (e.g., when and why a dam was built), institutional structure and dynamics (e.g., permitting for studies and actual removal), and place-based politics (e.g., community resistance to removal)&mdash;is crucial and <em>necessary</em>, but planning for these factors and ways to overcome them may not be <em>sufficient</em> to bring about a successful removal. No two (or three or four) dam removals are alike (see Figures; the Swanton and Warren Dams in VT still remain, while the Homestead Woolen Mills Dam in NH has been demolished). This does not mean it is impossible to generalize the lessons from one removal to another, or even from dam removal conflicts to other kinds of contested ecological restoration initiatives, but such generalizations should be cautious.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, conflicts over dam removal lay bare the ways in which landscapes are both materially and socially constructed. The crucial question becomes how to improve the ecological integrity of a physical landscape when that landscape is simultaneously loved or valued in its altered (dammed) state. People <em>care</em> about such landscapes, and their arguments for opposing removal under these terms are as rational as the scientific claims for removal. Ultimately, scholars of ecological restoration and intervention would be wise to pay attention to the great variability that resides in how history and memory are intertwined with landscapes, and how state and non-state actors engaged in contestations over restoration efforts must grapple with these constructed landscapes. Both political and ecology and landscape studies&mdash;and hence geography&mdash;are well positioned to contribute to these conversations.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the science of dam removal offers an important lens into how we think about expert knowledge in cases of ecological restoration by showing how seemingly straightforward scientific arguments around the benefits of river restoration are often at the mercy of the political dynamics of specific locales. The science of dam removal shows how communities can assert their own powerful political rationalities in the face of robust and widely accepted science. One of our goals has been to glean something about knowledge claims inserted into intractable environmental conflicts that might be of use across a range of geographical contexts and ecological interventions. As a transdisciplinary collaboration of one physical and two human geograephers, we are especially keen to uncover insights about how to re-affirm, on the one hand, the <em>value</em> of environmental knowledge in addressing thorny socioecological problems and, on the other, the need to recognize how that knowledge becomes inserted into environmental conflicts.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/05/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Sneddon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264195572_AllDams_RemoverdDams--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264195572_AllDams_RemoverdDams--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AllDamsNE\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264195572_AllDams_RemoverdDams--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AllDamsNE\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) All dams in New England, (B) Removed dams mapped by height and ecoregion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Chipman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Sneddon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AllDamsNE</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264624422_SwantonDam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264624422_SwantonDam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SwantonDam\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264624422_SwantonDam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SwantonDam\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Swanton Dam on Missiquoi River, Swanton, VT (USA).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Sneddon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Sneddon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SwantonDam</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264756956_WarrenDam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264756956_WarrenDam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"WarrenDam\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520264756956_WarrenDam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"WarrenDam\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The historic Warren Dam on the Mad River in Warren, VT (USA).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Sneddon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Sneddon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">WarrenDam</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520266034060_HomesteadWollenMillsDam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520266034060_HomesteadWollenMillsDam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HomesteadDam\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1263519/1263519_10247133_1520266034060_HomesteadWollenMillsDam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HomesteadDam\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of Homestead Woolen Mills Dam.
