Synthetic carriers have gained enormous attention thanks to the means developed to control their structure and functionalities.  In contrast, the structural regularity of abundant and sustainable biobased materials has been difficult to achieve, leading to their scarcity as well-fabricated carriers.  To address this challenge, the PI and his co-workers have been consistently exploring biobased materials for AI delivery.  As a result, dendrimer-like biopolymer (DLB) from plants has been identified as a potential material for AI protection and delivery.  The goal of this project is to explore DLB as a platform for generating functional biobased materials, with a focus on their capability to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble AIs.  The specific aims are to: (1) prepare DLB nanoparticles with various particle sizes and chemical properties and examine their cytotoxicity, (2) evaluate the impact of DLB structure on the solubility and stability of model AI molecules, and (3) assess in vitro digestibility of DLB-AI complexes and examine Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability of model AI molecules as affected by DLB structure.  \r\n\r\nNon-Technical:  When abundant and sustainable biobased materials meet with cutting-edge technologies, their values grow enormously.  Envision that millions of pounds of biomaterials are harvested from endless crop fields and custom-engineered to improve drug formulation and delivery, enhance food safety and nutrition, and advance agricultural practices.  That is what this SusChEM project will help to achieve.  At Purdue University, the project team is committed to sustainable materials research that promotes key areas in health systems through:  (1) basic research activities in nano and biobased materials, (2) partnership with the pharmaceutical industry, and (3) interdisciplinary educational activities.  Supported by this project, the PIs will create and disseminate new knowledge and technologies under the general theme of sustainable materials for health.  The project will help students and industry professionals to better understand or utilize materials science in their learning, research, and technology development.",
