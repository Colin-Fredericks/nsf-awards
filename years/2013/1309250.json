 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of the water channel aquaglyceroporin-3b (Aqp-3b) in cellular dynamics during early nervous system development and neural tube closure \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring early embryonic development, changes in the shape and placement of cells causes the neural plate to form the neural tube. Transcription factors like Zic1 in the neural plate direct the expression of genes that regulate cellular behavior during neural tube closure. While previous work has identified aquaglyceroporin-3b (aqp-3b), a water channel, as a downstream target of Zic factors, little is known about how aqp-3b affects nervous system development. The zebrafish model system will be used to determine the role of Aqp-3b during changes in cell shape and adhesion as the neural plate forms the neural tube. The goal of this project is to use the genetic and optical assets of the zebrafish embryo to study the closure of the neural tube, a developmental event that has far-reaching consequences for normal nervous system development.  \r\n\r\nThe training goals of this project are to provide experience in early nervous system developmental research conducted across species and to provide experience with developing undergraduate education. The education goals of this project involve using the rapid development and genetic accessibility of the zebrafish as a tool to integrate undergraduate instruction with molecular research. Aspects of this project will be developed into a course for American Indian tribal college students to introduce biological research and to create a lasting positive effect on their future participation in the field of developmental biology and neuroscience. This research-based course will expose students early in their biology careers to research with the goal of increasing their future success in STEM fields.",

Historically aquaporins have well-established roles in adult organisms as main components of urine concentration in the kidneys and as part of the machinery of wound closure. Yet, the field of developmental biology lacks established roles for Aquaporins in developing embryos and our project had significant intellectual merit by discovering a previously unknown role for Aquaporins.&nbsp; Our lab found an Aquaglyceroporin that is developmentally expressed in the frog <em>Xenopus laevis</em>.

During this time, a blastula embryo, which has one single layer of tissue surrounding an internal space, becomes a multilayered gastrula stage embryo via the movements of cells into the embryo. Essential to this proses is the delineation between tissues and the coordinated movements of cells that compose those tissues. Our lab has discovered that during gastrulation Aqp3b is essential for the formation of the Fibronectin protein barrier that separates the newly formed tissues in the gastrula embryos. Fibronectin is an extracellular protein that can link to form a matrix. This matrix is important for the tissue architecture of the developing embryos.

To further our investigation, we focused on determining if Aqp3b has a role in convergence and extension (CE). CE occurs both during neural tube closure and gastrulation to help from the embryo. Using a variety of methods, our goal was to determine when and where Aqp3b functions to facilitate CE. We found that both during gastrulation and closure of the neural tube, Aqp3b is important for the CE of the developing embryos and a loss in CE resulted in a reduction in the CE movement of cells during gastrulation, a disruption in the closure of the neural tube, and shorter body length as the embryo aged.
