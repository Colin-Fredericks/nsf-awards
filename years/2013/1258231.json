 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution is a rapid process that can be studied experimentally in natural populations, yet we know much more about evolution as the ultimate cause of change over time than we do about how it works on a day to day basis. This study will reveal how and why evolution does or does not happen by quantifying the different factors that can contribute to the way organisms can change over time. The investigators are studying evolution by transplanting guppies from a portion of a stream in Trinidad where guppies co-occur with predators and sustain high mortality rates, into four headwater streams that were previously guppy-free and predator free. Prior research demonstrated that the lower mortality risk in such environments causes the evolution of life histories (maturity, number of offspring produced, lifespan) and other attributes (male coloration, courtship behavior, neuromuscular performance) within two to ten years. The current experiments extend that work by reconstructing the pedigrees of the evolving populations and by quantify differences among individuals in reproductive success, thus partitioning change over time into nongenetic (environmental or maternal effects) and genetic effects.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve the participation of many undergraduate and graduate students, and continued outreach through a public website (cnas.ucr.edu/guppy) and in Trinidad. The project also strengthens international collaborations with scientists in Germany.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n       How, why and how fast does evolution happen in the natural world?  We addressed these questions by building on prior research on how guppies adapt to life with and without predators in natural streams.  In doing so, we proved that evolution is a contemporary process that can be characterized with experiments done in nature.  Here we focused on one possible consequence of  contemporary evolution, which is that the way organisms evolve may be shaped by the way they change their ecosystem, on how they cause evolution in other species, and on how these species interact with one another (eco-evo dynamics).  We performed four replicate transplants of guppies from a site where they were adapted to life with predators into portions of headwater streams that previously lacked guppies and predators.  We censused each population monthly. The founders and all new recruits were individually marked and we kept scales from all individuals as a source of DNA.  We used the DNA to construct pedigrees and quantify how successful each individual is in transmitting his/her genes to subsequent generations. This enables us to characterize evolution by quantifying differences among individuals in how many surviving offspring they produce.  We did the same for the one other species of fish found in the guppy introduction site (a killifish in the genus Rivulus) and in the \"control\" region, above barrier waterfalls that limit the upstream dispersal of guppies. We constructed artificial streams and performed short term experiments that characterized and quantified the causes that underlie the changes we see in the guppy introductions in natural streams.  Finally, we performed laboratory experiments to quantify how our introduced populations of guppies have evolved since introduction.\n\n              We tested for the presence of eco-evo dynamics with models that predict the time course of evolution either with or without eco-evo dynamics.  The observed evolutionary trajectory, as quantified in our laboratory studies, matches the predictions of the eco-evo model.  The signature of this interaction is the 1 to 2-year delay in guppy evolution.  The guppy populations took one to two years to grow to the carrying capacity of the environment then to show evidence of adaptation to that environment.  During this delay, we found that algae and invertebrates (guppy food) declined in abundance and the rate of recruitment of young killifish and overall abundance of killifish declined.  The growth rate and body sizes of the guppies declined in concert with the increase in guppy population density and decrease in food availability.  This match between the time lag in guppy evolution and  correlated changes in the ecosystem is the signature of eco-evo dynamics.\n\n              Our artificial stream experiments characterized how guppies had evolved.  At low population densities, characteristic of high predation environments, guppies from high predation guppies had higher fitness. These fitness differences disappeared when guppies were instead kept at high population densities, characteristic of low predation environments.  When killifish were present, low predation guppies had higher fitness than high predation guppies.  If the killifish are derived from a site where they naturally co-exist with guppies and have evolved in response to guppies, then guppy fitness is higher still.  Guppy adaptation to low predation environments thus includes adaptation to the higher population densities they attain when predators are absent and the co-evolution of guppies and killifish.\n\n              Our research program proves that eco-evo dynamics play a significant role in shaping both ecology and evolution.  Traditional ecological theory treats organisms as constants in equations and hence implicitly assumes they do not evolve. They did so because it was thought that evolution is so much slower than ecology that it could be ignored.   Theoretical predictions can be dramatically different if theory is modified to incorporate contemporary evolution. Likewise, predictions from evolutionary theory can change dramatically when eco-evo dynamics are included.  Our results show that these interactions are present and large. The circumstances of our study are ones that are common to many natural and disturbed ecosystems; e.g. the loss of wolves, mountain lions and bears from much of North America or the introduction of novel species in many parts of the world.  If eco-evo dynamics are present, then including them can enhance the predictive value of ecology and evolution plus improve applied disciplines, like wildlife management, efforts to restore disturbed communities or the management of natural resources (e.g., fisheries). \n\n              Our study has created resources for studying the genetic basis of adaptation.
