 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recently completed dual-polarimetric upgrade of the national WSR-88D Doppler radar network has provided a wide variety of new capabilities for weather observations.  One notable area of improvement that has as-yet not been the subject of focused research is the ability to detect tornadoes through analysis of polarimetric variables within zones of lofted debris, collectively known as the Tornadic Debris Signature (TDS).  While these observations are already being accessed, user confidence in (and hence impact of) these new data is limited in part because the scattering characteristics of tornadic debris are not well understood in a quantitative sense.  This multi-pronged project will make use of observations, simulations and modeling to further knowledge on how tornadic debris is observed by weather radars.  \r\n\r\nThe project embodies four primary thrusts and associated tasks, which will in-turn enable the study of several scientific questions.  The researchers plan to begin their investigation by cataloging radar cross-section (RCS) for common tornadic debris types using theory, simulations and laboratory-type anechoic chamber measurements.  Sample objects will include distributions of straight and small twigs, free-standing leaves absent significant roughness and bending effects, small pieces of wood, hydrometeors, and dust.  Numerical simulations of polarimetric radar data using the RCS database and 3D wind fields (as generated via prior tornado-scale numerical modeling efforts) will then be conducted.  The PIs also plan to collect additional new high-resolution observational data from the Rapid scanning X-band polarimetric (RaXpol) mobile radar and nearby fixed-based network radars, and to evaluate these data in tandem with detailed post-tornado damage surveys.  These tasks will subsequently drive development of a suite of signal processing algorithms to improve detection and meaningful characterization tornadic debris signatures with the goal of distinguishing debris type, size, and concentration.  The main scientific objectives are to:  1) Investigate the two main hypotheses for negative ZDR in tornadoes, Mie scattering and common scatter alignment, and 2) Examine the physical processes associated with tornadic debris, such as lofting, centrifuging and loading, and their relationship to tornado and supercell dynamics.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project map strongly on mission agency efforts to increase public safety, as this work will potentially assist the operational meteorological community through improved tornado detection and ability to better estimate severity of ensuing damage in real-time.  Development of an anechoic chamber will facilitate future research focusing on antenna design and performance, both by investigators at the grantee university and co-located organizations who are part of the National Weather Center.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be directly included in the research activities and the interdisciplinary engineering and meteorology curriculum.",

Since airborne debris cause most tornado fatalities, understanding how much debris is lofted and the three-dimensional distribution of debris is critical to understanding its damage potential to structures and hazards posed to the public. With the nationwide upgrade of the NEXRAD radar network to dual-polarization, widespread benefits can be obtained from advancing scientific understanding of these radar debris signatures.&nbsp;The goal of this project was to use dual-polarization radar observations and computer simulations to better understand dual-polarization tornado debris signatures (TDSs) and how they relate to three-dimensional debris distributions and tornado wind speeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project used multiple dual-polarization radar data sets, including data from the 10 May 2010 and 20 May 2013 tornado outbreaks. For the first time, an intercomparison between TDSs at two different wavelengths was performed, showing greater differences in radar reflectivity during the most damaging periods. Using rapid-scan radar data collected during the 20 May 2013 Moore, Oklahoma EF-tornado tornado, bands of ejected debris were studied and found to correspond to intense winds in the rear-flank gust front and a \"failed occlusion\". During the failed occlusion, the tornado attempted to dissipate, but was steered back beneath the parent updraft and reintensified. Finally, the study conducted the first comparison between debris signatures and three-dimensional winds. This comparison showed that suction vortices, which are thought to cause the greatest damage in tornadoes, contain the largest debris.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To better understand the radar observations collected, a computer simulation tool was developed called SimRadar. SimRadar is the first radar simulator to emulate dual-polarization radar signatures of debris, and uses a high-resolution, fluid dynamic model simulation of tornado winds that calculate the motions of different particles in the tornado (leaves, wood boards, raindrops, etc.). Each piece of debris then produces a reflected radar signal back to the simulated radar based on its reflectiveness determined from laboratory measurements and electromagnetics equations. Simulated radar debris signatures were then compared to&nbsp;mobile radar and NEXRAD observations of TDSs to validate the model.</p>\n<p>The simulated tornado debris signatures were found to vary depending on the types of debris lofted, the intensity of the tornado, and the radar system properties (transmit frequency). An interesting finding is that debris in tornadoes exhibit some degree of alignment and the debris alignment direction depends on tornado wind speeds and directions. The radar simulator was also used to develop a new technique to separate rain and debris to provide more accurate estimates of winds in tornadoes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project included involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students, fostering international collaborations, and contributing to improved public safety. The project supported three Ph.D. and two M.S. students on interdisciplinary topics in meteorology and engineering. Project participants also mentored a Research Experience for Undergraduates student. The student group included both graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. The project strengthened a growing collaboration between Kyoto University and the University of Oklahoma on tornado debris research. Finally, the project's findings provided valuable information to help forecasters understand tornado debris signatures and their relationship to the amount of damage produced and the tornado's intensity. New algorithms developed during the project can be used to characterize debris signatures, improve tornado detection, and provide more accurate wind estimates in tornadoes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bodine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1303685/1303685_10269702_1525139022462_ScreenShot2018-04-30at8.41.56PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1303685/1303685_10269702_1525139022462_ScreenShot2018-04-30at8.41.56PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simulated Tornado with Debris\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1303685/1303685_10269702_1525139022462_ScreenShot2018-04-30at8.41.56PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simulated Tornado with Debris\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SimRadar produces a visualization of the tornado with debris and rain drops shown here.
