 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the development of a commercially-viable robotic Semi-Automated Masonry (SAM) system.  This SAM system will revolutionize the construction industry by significantly increasing the efficiency and throughput of brick wall construction using automation.  The SAM system will be leased or sold to masonry contractors.  The core technology being developed incorporates proprietary sensing, control systems, and mortar dispensing to achieve computer aided design (CAD)-driven, highly accurate automated bricklaying capability.  The Phase II project will focus on developing and integrating key technical components of the system.  The main technical objectives for the Phase II grant are to (1) fully integrate a mortar pumping and measurement system, (2) achieve brick placement accuracy during all jobsite conditions, (3) develop CAD to brick mapping software, and (4) to prepare the product for commercial viability.  In addition, we will perform a number of site demonstrations to prove commercial viability.  This project will stretch the bounds of commercial robotics as well as expand the scope of possibilities across the construction industry.  Many new technologies will continue to be developed during the Phase II project in order to progress from prototyping to testing, and eventually commercial readiness.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a technology to revolutionize the masonry construction industry.  The SAM robotic system will provide many significant societal benefits including more predictable and reliable work, less physical demand on masons, lower costs and more design flexibility for the use of brick.  By reducing the physical demands on the mason and increasing the use of technology, it will provide significant health benefits, effectively increasing the work life of older masons and attracting younger masons to the industry.  Brick-based construction represents a significant portion of the global and U.S. economies, with over $20 billion spent on all domestic masonry work, and over $5 billion spent on commercial brick masonry alone.  The significant increase in efficiency provided by this SAM system will make brick masonry more affordable.  This could potentially lead to growth of the brick industry, resulting in many environmental and customer benefits such as energy and resource conservation.  Through commercialization of the world's first robotic Semi-Automated masonry system, this project will help to expand the capability of an industry and revitalize the masonry trade.",
