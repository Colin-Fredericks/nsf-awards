 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third annual meeting of the Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is to be held at Purdue University on April 19-21, 2013. The project was proposed in 2011 by a group of underrepresented graduate students in the University of Iowa Mathematics Department. The meeting is now largely run and organized by underrepresented recent math PhD. Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory. Two distinguished graduate students will give an hour long presentation, one on a topological topic and one on an algebraic topic. Also one invited faculty member, Dr. Jennifer Vasquez of Scranton University, will give a one hour keynote address. Invited undergraduate participants will give poster presentations on algebraic and topological research topics.\r\n\r\nUSTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development. Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encourage students in the mathematical sciences at all levels to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. The conference website is http://www.ustars.org.",
