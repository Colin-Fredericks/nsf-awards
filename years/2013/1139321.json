 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at assessing the global impact of lightning-generated Very Low Frequency (VLF) waves on radiation belt electron loss, a process known as lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP). The project will address the following topics: (1) Quantify the connection between injection of energetic solar particles during geomagnetic storms, (2) Quantify the connections between lightning parameters and resulting LEP characteristics, and (3) Derive the total contribution of lightning to radiation belt energetic electron losses. \r\n \r\nIn order to quantify the role of lightning in energetic electron losses from the radiation belts, continuous and reliable global lightning geo-location data and a global network of observation sites to detect these precipitation events are needed. A new lightning geo-location network provides complete global coverage of lightning activity for the first time, and a global network of VLF receivers now operates, allowing monitoring of ionospheric disturbances associated with the electron precipitation. Finally, recent efforts have yielded two major breakthroughs in modeling the physical process. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the training of a graduate student at Stanford University. The program will leverage, and consequently strengthen, an international network of VLF receivers that was set up under the auspices of the International Heliophysical Year (IHY). Under this program, Stanford University has placed \u00a1\u00ad25 receivers in developing countries, sponsoring and training local scientists to use the data.  Stanford has built significant infrastructure in support of this program and is continuing to hold a series of international workshops engaging scientists around the world.",
