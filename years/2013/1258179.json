 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes advantage of the metabolic quiescence of hibernating arctic ground squirrels to study how nutritional needs are translated into neural signals.  The overall research plan is aimed at deciphering how the biochemical pathways that convert food to cellular building blocks converge with those that lead to the synthesis of neural signaling molecules, specifically, the neurotransmitter glutamate.  Aside from its direct aims, the project outcomes will have significant relevance to our understanding of the impact that climate change and nutrient availability have on a vulnerable Arctic species and to our understanding of nutritional responses and metabolic balance in many organisms. \r\n\r\nThe research will involve Alaska Native students and outreach activities for the local community.  As well, new and advanced technologies and instrumentation will be introduced into training and research programs at this EPSCOR state University.   All data generated from this project will be made publicly available in a data repository at ftp://www.brains-hibernation.iab.alaska.edu.",
