Moreover, the research supported by the acquisition would impact a wide range of scientific and engineering fields such as digital communications, networking, distributed computing, mobile computing, network security and privacy, information systems, and physics.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis acquisition would enable the development of new labs, projects, and lectures in seven courses and would provide students with hands-on experiences.  The instrument would also provide valuable research experiences to undergraduates (through senior design projects, summer undergraduate research, and independent study research projects) and graduate Masters and Ph.D. students in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer and information science, and physics. The university has also been actively involving minority, women, and disadvantaged background students in research. Thus, the instrument will contribute in the well-established outreach programs such as NSF-funded CSUTeach program (0934842) which is designed to improve the quality of high school science and math teachers, and the Fenn Academy, a consortium between the Fenn College of Engineering and a group of high schools and local corporations (established to attract students to engineering fields through high-quality pre-engineering programs). The instrument would also lend support to some local companies.",
