 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to The University of Pittsburgh to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2013-2016. This Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TECBio) REU program has the overarching theme of \"multiscale modeling, simulation, and systems-level analyses for biological discovery\". TECBio students can expect a challenging and fulfilling research experience that will prepare them for a successful career in graduate school. Rising Juniors and Seniors from all facets of the life, physical, and computer sciences and engineering, and particularly those students from small school and/or underrepresented backgrounds, are encouraged to apply. TECBio students will select from a pool of 38 diverse research mentors, whose work cover areas that include bioinformatics, bioimage analysis, computational drug discovery, computational structural biology, and systems biology. In addition to performing cutting-edge research, TECBio students will participate in a weekly journal club, attend research and career seminars organized specifically for the program, take part in an ethics forum that will instruct them in the responsible conduct of research, present their work at a Pittsburgh-wide annual research symposium, tour research facilities such as the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and experience the various social and cultural activities available in Pittsburgh - America's most livable city. TECBio students will also play an active role in enhancing the TECBio program and will have several opportunities, including the common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs to give their feedback. Following the completion of the program, TECBio alumni will receive continued mentoring by the program directors and mentors, who will maintain contact with students to help them establish and maintain success in their nascent careers. Additional information can be found at www.tecbioreu.pitt.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Joseph C. Ayoob at jayoob@pitt.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Chakra Chennubhotla at chakracs@pitt.edu).\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

As one of the &ldquo;New Biologies&rdquo;, Computational Biology uses quantitative approaches and the power of computing to answer questions in many fields of science. Our TECBio program reaches out to students from a wide range of academic disciplines, from ethnic and racial backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences, and from schools with limited research opportunities to give them a primary research and training experience in this new interdisciplinary field. Over 80% of the 88 students who have gone through our program over the past 7 years were from either of the aforementioned groups.&nbsp; These students were all integrated into our department&rsquo;s &ldquo;tiered mentoring&rdquo; framework, which both gave them access to a team of mentors and provided them with the opportunity to mentor younger scientists. In addition to performing cutting-edge computational research in bioimage analysis, genomics, structural biology, and systems biology, TECBio students also participated in other academic and professional development enrichment activities, such as introductory classes in computational biology, hands-on computer laboratory sessions, research and career seminars, responsible conduct of research training, and numerous writing and presenting opportunities, all of which were geared to help prepare our students for success in graduate school and other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-related careers. To this end, the overwhelming majority (over 80%) of our program alumni who have completed their undergraduate degree have gone on to pursue further education and careers in STEM fields. The majority of these students, which also equals about 50% of all graduated alumni, have enrolled in graduate programs. We are encouraged by the success of our program in helping to prepare the next generation of scientists, science educators, and ambassadors for science. The TECBio REU @ Pitt looks forward to continuing our efforts to equip tomorrow&rsquo;s scientific leaders who will be at the forefront of interdisciplinary scientific research and continue to push the edge of discovery. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590168050_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590168050_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TECBio Biomouse\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590168050_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TECBio Biomouse\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">see image</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TECBio REU @ Pitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TECBio Biomouse</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590240817_Good-tecies(cropped)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590240817_Good-tecies(cropped)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2014 TECBio Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590240817_Good-tecies(cropped)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2014 TECBio Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2014 TECBio Students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TECBio REU @ Pitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2014 TECBio Students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590292507_TECBio2013cropped--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590292507_TECBio2013cropped--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TECBio Students 2013\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590292507_TECBio2013cropped--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TECBio Students 2013\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">TECBio Students 2013</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TECBio REU @ Pitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TECBio Students 2013</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590359462_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590359462_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TECBio Student Majors and Demographics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263020/1263020_10234674_1498590359462_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TECBio Student Majors and Demographics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">see image</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TECBio REU @ Pitt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TECBio Student Majors and Demographics</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
