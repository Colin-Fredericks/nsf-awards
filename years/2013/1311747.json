The device engineers and the circuit designers are well bridged and educated by the research innovations.  The developed techniques can be directly transferred to industry applications under the close collaborations with leading industry partners, and directly impact the future memristor-based VLSI systems. The activities in the collaboration also include the tutorials in the major conferences on the technical aspects of the projects and new course development.",
