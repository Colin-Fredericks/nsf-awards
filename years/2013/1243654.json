 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the biggest scientific problems of the past 50 years is how a protein folds into a stable 3-dimensional conformation critical for its function in the cell.  While the process should be predictable from just the sequence of amino acids, one is still unable to make such a prediction.  The most successful models of protein folding have been simple two- or three-state models.  However, recent results from the PI's lab as well as others have shown these simple models to fail when examining fast folding kinetics in a variety of systems.  The objective of this project is to further these preliminary studies by investigating different aspects of complexity in folding proteins using a variety of spectroscopic probes and state-of-the-art ultrarapid mixers.  The experimental results will be compared with simulation results from various computational biology labs. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theory which can predict the process solely from the amino acid sequence.  By coupling theory and experiment on the microsecond timescale and considering the impact of complexity, this project will significantly advance the field of protein folding towards the long-term goal.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project encompasses aspects of structural biology, computation biology, optical spectroscopy and polymer physics.  Therefore the students involved in this work will require cross-disciplinary training to accomplish the scientific goals.  As part of a new graduate program in Quantitative Biology at MSU, the PI has designed new lecture and laboratory courses to introduce physical science students to biology and biology students to quantitative methods.  These courses continue to evolve and the PI will also develop a course aimed at undergraduates in the life sciences to take a more quantitative approach to biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProtein folding is the process in which a chain of amino acids finds its stable, native structure that is required for its function.  This project has explored different ways in which complexity arises in observations of protein folding.  A common way to understand protein folding involves expressing the free energy landscape in one dimension and reducing the path to a small number (2, 3, 4) states.  We have consistently found that observing protein folding on the submillisecond time scale and using multiple spectroscopic probes uncovers kinetics that can?t be reduced to a small number of states on a 1-d landscape.  For example the B1 domain of protein G showed multiple kinetic phases when measured with different probes in microfluidic mixers.  Single molecule force measurements on the same sequence find at least two unfolding pathways and intermediates under conditions that favor unfolding.  This suggests the unfolded side of the major folding energy barrier is not a smooth landscape. \n\nOther work in the project has attempted to quantify the dynamics of unfolded proteins.  Previous work had found that unfolded proteins under folding conditions (i.e. before they fold) have extremely slow intramolecular diffusion, up to ~1000x slower than proteins in denaturant or intrinsically disordered proteins.  Other previous work had found that this huge range in diffusion coefficients was observed with close-range Trp-Cys quenching, but the range was not as large for longer-range fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).  However, the discrepancies had not been tested on the same protein under the same conditions before.  We did this comparison on the protein alpha-synuclein, a protein that aggregates in Parkinson?s disease and found a significant difference in the measured diffusion with these different methods.  Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the difference is due to the conformations that Trp-Cys quenching measures are significantly more long-lived, or \"sticky\" than the conformations that FRET measures.  These \"sticky\" conformations could be the ones that are capable of starting aggregation. \n\nThe broader impacts of this work is the integration of biology and physics.  This is reflected in the development of an entirely new curriculum to train biology students in physics.  The traditional curriculum for introductory physics for the life sciences is a simplified version of the engineering curriculum and contains mostly macroscopic examples, such as shooting cannon balls or rotating gears, which have no relevance to biology.  However, there are many good biological examples that can be taught in introductory physics if the focus is on the molecular and cellular level.  The new curriculum still covers the major objectives of introductory physics but re-focuses the courses around two themes, diffusion and dipoles.  This allows exploration of advanced topics such as entropy, free energy and the interaction of biological molecules with light.  This course sequence has been offered twice at Michigan State University with good student outcomes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa Lapidus"
