 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hastings/1246223\r\n \r\nThis award supports a project with the aim of distinguishing the sources of nitrate deposition to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) using isotopic ratios snow in archive snow and ice samples. The isotopic composition of nitrate has been shown to contain information about the source of the nitrate (i.e. nitrogen oxides = NOx = NO+NO2) and the oxidation processes that convert NOx to nitrate in the atmosphere prior to deposition. A difficulty in interpreting records in the context of NOx sources is that nitrate can be post-depositionally processed in surface snow, such that the archived record does not reflect the composition of the atmosphere. This intellectual merit of this work specifically aims to investigate variability in the isotopic composition of nitrate in snow and ice from the WAIS in the context of accumulation rate, NOx source emissions, and atmospheric chemistry. These records will be interpreted in the context of our understanding of biospheric (biomass burning, microbial processes in soils), atmospheric (lightning, transport, chemistry), and climate (temperature, accumulation rate) changes over time. A graduate student will be supported as part of this project, and both graduate student and PI will be involved in communicating the utility and results of polar research to elementary school students in the Providence, RI area. The broader impacts of the project also include making efforts to attract more young, female scientists to polar research by establishing a connection between the Earth Science Women's Network (ESWN), an organization PI Hastings helped to establish, and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS). Finally, results of all measurements will be presented at relevant conferences, made available publicly and published in peer-reviewed journals.",

Over time, these sources have changed in strength related to changes in climate, changes in the biosphere, changes in the atmosphere, and changes related to human intervention. The major sink of NOx from the atmosphere is deposition in rain or snow as nitric acid (also termed nitrate). NO<sub>x</sub> is converted to nitrate through reactions with major oxidant species in the atmosphere, and as a result, is an important component for understanding the oxidizing capacity of our atmosphere today and in the past. Nitrate is a major ion found in polar snow and ice cores, and it holds great interest as a way to potentially reconstruct over time how the atmosphere and biosphere have changed, with and without human intervention. Our major questions for this project included: can we distinguish the major sources of nitrate to West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in the recent past? can we distinguish the major sources over glacial/interglacial timescales? and does the photochemical production of nitrate change significantly on these timescales? This latter question is related to the fact that nitrate deposited in snow and exposed to sunlight at the surface can undergo photochemical processing, such that it can be lost from the snow (as NOx) or recycled in the air above the snow and transferred back to the snow. Because this process is dependent upon the amount of time the nitrate is exposed to light in surface snow, we hypothesized that the accumulation rate of snow might control how much nitrate is lost or recycled. To test this idea, we were able to access archived ice and snow samples from the National Ice Core Laboratory from different location on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This was a unique opportunity to test an area that should receive similar long-range transported nitrate (i.e. same major sources) and similar amounts of sunlight at different times of year, but has locations that have very different amounts of snow accumulation annually. We aimed to establish how the isotope ratios in nitrate (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O) vary with accumulation rate on the West Antarctic ice sheet, because the isotopes are sensitive to both the sources and chemical processing (in the air and/or in the snow) of nitrate. Our original hypothesis did not hold, and we did not find important variations in the isotopes of nitrate related directly to accumulation rate. Instead, the amount of nitrate processed in snow appears to be more complex, related to both the amount of time nitrate spends near the surface (i.e. accumulation rate) and the chemistry of the snow itself (i.e. nitrate may be complexed in different ways and therefore less sensitive to photochemical processing). If the nitrate is not processed, it represents a primary signal from the atmosphere and can be interpreted in the context of sources and atmospheric chemistry over time. If the nitrate is processed significantly, then it is more representative of physical processes and not the original, atmospheric signal. Ultimately, we created both modern and paleoclimate records of the isotopic composition of nitrate for interpretation in the context of sources today (human and natural) and sources in the past (natural) that can contribute to greater understanding of the connection between biospheric (biomass burning, microbial processes in soils), atmospheric (lightning, transport, chemistry), and climate (temperature, accumulation rate) changes over time.
