 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atoms in highly-excited so-called Rydberg states are true giants of the atomic world with their outer electrons traveling relatively slowly in orbits with diameters that can approach a fraction of a millimeter.  As for any traveler in distant lands, Rydberg electrons are both isolated and vulnerable and their motions can be readily controlled using a carefully-tailored sequence of 'kicks' imparted by a series of electric field pulses.  Under the influence of such kicks the Rydberg electron can display a wide variety of behaviors including chaos.This will be exploited to explore the potential of emerging new paradigms for information processing based on the complex behavior of chaotic systems including the use of Rydberg atoms as logic gates, in pattern recognition, and in data mining.  The behavior of pairs of Rydberg atoms positioned close to each other such that they interact very strongly will be examined to explore energy interchange and to search for novel long-lived molecular Rydberg states containing two excited electrons.  Attempts will also be made to create long-lived atoms containing two excited electrons that are each placed in large orbits and whose motions are stabilized by their mutual interactions and mirror that of a classical planetary system.  Measurements will be undertaken in which radio-frequency fields will be employed to drive the motion of the Rydberg electron to probe the behavior of atoms in ground or low-lying excited states when acted upon by ultra-short ultra-intense laser pulses -- in essence replacing the extreme lasers by extreme atoms. These studies with Rydberg atoms will provide a valuable bridge between the nanoscale world of quantum physics and the macroscopic world of Newtonian mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe present research program will contribute to the training of the scientific workforce by providing students a firm foundation in many areas of physics together with a diverse array of experimental skills in many technologically relevant areas such as high-vacuum technology, lasers, high speed electronics, computerized data acquisition and control, and computer modeling. The experiments on strongly-interacting Rydberg systems will provide valuable new insights into the mesoscopic world and mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots and quantum wells that play a prominent role in exploratory concepts and technologies related to quantum information processing and quantum computing. The work will also provide new information on physics in the ultra-fast ultra-intense regime and speak to the engineering of low-lying atomic (and molecular) states by using attosecond laser pulses to control their properties and behavior, including their chemical reactions.  Studies of the response of Rydberg atoms to series of electric field pulses promise new insights into classical chaos and the mathematical tools used to describe it, and furnish a novel laboratory in which to test new paradigms for information processing and data manipulation based on the characteristics of chaotic systems.  Rydberg atoms lie at the interface between the quantum and classical worlds and provide a critical bridge between both.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWork performed under this program has focused on the manipulation of the excited electronic states  in atoms as a means to control atomic interactions, to create novel chemical bonds, and to simulate the properties of novel materials. This work utilizes atoms in highly excited states, often termed high Rydberg states.  Rydberg atoms are atoms in which one electron is excited to a very high-lying state, typically using a laser.  Such atoms possess properties quite unlike those normally associated with atoms in their lowest-lying ground states.  In particular, they are physically very large, and very fragile.  Indeed, were such atoms opaque, they would be visible to the naked eye.  These giants of the atomic world lie at the interface between the classical world described by Newton?s Laws of Motion and the quantum world described by Quantum Mechanics.  While many of their properties can be described using the classical Bohr model of the atom which pictures the atom as an electron in distant orbit about a compact nucleus, other aspects of their behavior require a quantum description.\n\nThe present work has shown that the motion of the excited electron, which defines the electronic state, can be controlled by applying one, or more, \"kicks\" to it in the form of short electric field pulses.  By carefully controlling the size, number, direction, and timing of such pulses it is possible, using methods similar to those employed by NASA to control satellite orbits, to steer the electron into different targeted final states and create \"designer\" atoms.  Such manipulation allows the exercise of great control over the properties of the product atoms and their interactions.  For example, it was observed that creation of one Rydberg atom can block the excitation of neighboring atoms.  This so-called \"blockade effect\" has promising applications in the field of quantum computing.  The work has also provided a number of new insights into the mesoscopic world, i.e., the world at micrometer scales, and mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots and quantum wells that play an important role in exploring concepts and technologies related to quantum information processing and coherent control.  The blockade effect was also exploited to produce pairs of Rydberg atoms with well-defined initial separations to examine their mutual interactions and how these depend on their internal states and on their relative positions and orientations.  This work not only pointed to techniques to control the outcome of chemical reactions to favor the production of desired compounds, but also revealed a new type of chemical bond that can lead to the formation of ultralong-range  molecules whose constituent atoms remain at large separations.  Furthermore, by creating multiple excited atoms and controlling their geometric arrangement it is possible to simulate the behavior of similarly-structured materials which can provide new insights into materials science and into the behavior of the new materials that are now being engineered that possess novel electrical and magnetic properties of practical importance.  The present work has also provided new insights into physics in the ultra-fast, ultra-intense regime and speaks to the manipulation of low-lying atomic and molecular states at the sub-nanoscale using the new generation of ultrafast, ultra-intense lasers.\n\nThe graduate and undergraduate students involved in the present work gained valuable practical training in many areas of advanced experimental physics which equipped them with the tools necessary to enhance the scientific workforce and succeed in the many different research environments encountered in academic, industrial, and government laboratories.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: F.
