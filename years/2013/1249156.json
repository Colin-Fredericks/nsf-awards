 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers changes in regional climate occurring primarily in and over the tropical oceans, due to greenhouse gas increases.  Among the robust regional climate changes found in ensembles of climate model simulations, three are addressed here: a pattern of \"El Nino-like\" sea surface temperature (SST) changes in the tropical Pacific; a minimum in the warming of SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic area which is the main development region (MDR) for Atlantic tropical cyclones, accompanied by an increase in vertical wind shear in the region (which would presumably inhibit tropical cyclone formation); and the meridional shift in the intertropical convergence zone (ICTZ) which has been tentatively ascribed to the slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by global warming.  These regional changes will be examined by decomposing local SST change into components forced separately by 1) the increase in local surface radiation; 2) redistribution of changes in near-surface heat ocean content by the mean ocean circulation; 3) redistribution of the mean near-surface heat content by changes in the wind-driven surface currents; and 4) changes in evaporative cooling due to changes in surface wind speed.  The four terms, which come from a linearization of the perturbation surface energy balance equation, have been previously associated with specific mechanisms of regional SST change. In particular term 4 expresses the dynamics of the wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback, in which the quadratic dependence of evaporation on surface wind speed cause evaporative cooling to vary regionally according to the strength of the mean winds and their direction relative to changes in wind. Likewise term 2 encapsulates the ocean dynamical thermostat (ODT) mechanism, in which a uniform increase in surface energy input causes less local SST increase in a region of divergent surface currents as the additional heat is transported out of the region. This mechanism would be expected to yield a reduction in SST warming in the Eastern Pacific cold tongue region relative to the western Pacific, thereby acting to oppose the El Nino-like warming pattern found in climate change simulations.  The methodology for determining the relative contributions of the terms involves numerical integrations of a climate model in configurations in which the terms are selectively enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\nBeyond its intrinsic scientific value, the work has broader impacts due to the consequences of changes in tropical ocean conditions have for fisheries, marine ecology, and the formation of tropical cyclones.  The work will also help to determine the extent to which climate model simulations can be confidently used to anticipate climate change at regional scales.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIf there were no ocean, strengthening the greenhouse effect would make the Earth?s surface warm up within a few years.  However, because it takes much longer to warm the great thermal mass of the sea, the presence of the ocean slows down the process of warming, somewhat like a block of ice would slow the warming of a room on a hot day.  Because of this delay, the Earth?s temperature is more sensitive to greenhouse gases than it appears, and even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to stabilize, the ocean-atmosphere system would continue to warm for centuries as heat penetrated further and further into the ocean.  In order to understand how strong this effect is, we need to understand how heat uptake by the ocean occurs.\n\n \n\nFor part of the project, we study ocean heat uptake by performing experiments with an ocean general circulation model.  We simulate the warming of the ocean surface by greenhouse gases and measure how heat penetrates the ocean.  Heat is often conceptualized as a kind of fluid that is injected into the ocean surface and is then carried downward by the ocean circulation the way a dye would be carried by the water.  However there is another mode of heat uptake by the ocean associated with the change in circulation. \n\n \n\nWithin the ocean, even in the absence of global warming, there are large variations in temperature between the warm surface water in the tropics and cold water at great depth and in polar regions.  These temperature gradients are maintained in part by the ocean circulation.  If the circulation changes, then the warm-water region might expand (or contract), and an expansion of the warm water implies that the water is absorbing heat from the atmosphere.  Therefore the ocean can take up heat even without global warming, merely by redistributing pre-existing temperature variations.   In our study, we looked at both how ocean circulation carries heat down, and how temperature redistribution allows the ocean to absorb heat.\n\n \n\nClimate models suggest that a global warming will make a large change in the currents of the Atlantic.  Today, about 15 million cubic meters of water per second flow northward in the top kilometer of the ocean, sink to greater depths near Greenland, and return southward near the sea floor.  This is called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC.  The AMOC carries heat into the northern North Atlantic.  Temperature and precipitation variations due to global warming may weaken AMOC so that it may only carry 10 million cubic meters per second or less.  If less warm water flows northward, the northern North Atlantic would not warm as much as the rest of the Earth.  The cooling of the water allows it to absorb more heat because of the AMOC weakening.\n\n \n\nBut does the ocean as a whole absorb more heat, or do other parts of the ocean absorb less heat so that the net effect is negligible?  The design of previous experiments made it hard to answer this question, but we analyzed the heat absorption in a new way that allowed us to estimate the amount of heat absorbed by the ocean.  We found that the dominant heat uptake occurrs in the North Atlantic, so that the AMOC slow-down does indeed increase the amount of heat going into the ocean.\n\n \n\nHowever, in further experiments, we found something surprising.  When we subjected the ocean to global warming without any changes in precipitation, AMOC still grew weaker, but the circulation changes actually caused the global ocean to absorb less heat than it would if circulation did not change.  With further work, we learned that the apparently simple behavior of our first experiment (AMOC weakening leads to more heat uptake) masks more complex behavior occuring in both the Atlantic and Pacific. \n\n \n\nOur work is fundamental research to understand how the ocean is affected by global warming.  For a given amount of carbon emissions, different coupled atmosphere-ocean models give different projections of how much warming will occur and how quickly.  One of the differences among models occurs because of different heat uptake by the ocean.  Work such as ours should help scientists make more accurate climate simulations, which in turn could better guide society in assessing the risks associated with global warming. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry Klinger"
