In addition to these applications, the medical field is one of the most important application areas of this technology. For hygienic purposes, the unique capability of EM waves to transfer power to sealed devices in a contact-/cable-less way is a major advantage. Furthermore, WPT could have a significant impact in health and biomonitoring applications, virtually eliminating the need for painful and infection-prone surgical procedures, which are currently necessary for periodical battery replacement, by wirelessly charging in-vivo implanted electronics.

Also, the magnetic coupling is preferred to satisfy the fundamental requirement of penetrating the human body, which is electrically lossy conductor, to provide the power to the receiver in the human body. A two-frequency split, called the &ldquo;horn effect&rdquo;, is usually associated with the fundamental operation of the magnetic resonance wireless power transmission in configurations with very small separation distances between transmitter and receiver coils. This can be a major issue for WPT applications on moving or non-stationary platforms, such as the human body, typically pushing the values of the resonance frequency outside the allowable frequency bands or drastically deteriorating the coupling efficiency. In order to compensate for the effect of human body part movements (e.g. breathing and turning), a real-time active matching circuit (MC) has to be inserted between the signal source and the transmitter coil. The overview of a typical magnetic resonant wireless power transmission system with real-time matching circuits on the transmitter side is depicted in Fig. 1.

In order to minimize the power consumption of the active matching system, the controller of the system focuses only on choosing the best matching circuit states among the set of preselected impedance values through GA and clustering processes.
