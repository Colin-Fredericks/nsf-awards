Green computing is a rapidly establishing interdisciplinary research area spanning across the fields of computer science and engineering, electrical engineering and other engineering disciplines. Green computing or sustainable computing is the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. IGCC has established itself as the premier conference in this area. The conference will enable researchers and students to the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. This grant will provide travel grants to 10 students who may otherwise not be able to attend IGCC and take advantage of the available learning opportunities in the newly evolving research area of green computing.",
