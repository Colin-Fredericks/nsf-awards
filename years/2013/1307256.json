 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a strong team of researchers from Cornell University to work on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Contributions to the program include technical developments in Silicon Pixel Detectors and advanced track triggering; operations support in pixel tracking and event triggering during the upcoming run of the LHC at collision energies of up to 14 TeV and a high luminosities; and a broad and coherent program of data analysis on important discovery channels with significant focus on Supersymmetry.   The Cornell group's efforts in broader impacts go significantly beyond the norm, with education and outreach to community colleges, rural middle schools, summer research camps for students and programs for participants underrepresented in science.",
