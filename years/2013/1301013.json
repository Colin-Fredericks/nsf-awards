 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this proposal is to investigate an ultra-low power, miniaturized, spintronic nanowire strain sensing device with an ultra-high sensitivity. This concept leverages two different physical phenomena: (i) stress induced magnetization rotation in nanoscale magnetostrictive materials; and (ii) change in the magneto-resistance of a \"spin-valve\" heterostructure nanowire consisting of magnetically-hard/spacer/magnetically-soft layers, which is induced by a rotation of the magnetization orientation of the soft layer.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this could lead to a miniature strain sensor with an active area of 0.1mm x 0.1mm and with a sensitivity exceeding state-of-the-art, while consuming 2-3 orders of magnitude less power. Such a device could strongly impact several areas such as structural health monitoring, pressure, flow, acoustic and seismic sensing. This project will provide a strong multidisciplinary experience and mentorship for PhD students and will be leveraged to enhance innovative workshops on sensing and energy harvesting for high school students through the Math-Science Innovation Center. Under-represented K-12 students will be hosted for a month in summer under VCU's Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering (RAPME) program and trained in nanofabrication under this project.",
