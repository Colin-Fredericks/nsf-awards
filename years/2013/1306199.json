 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next generation of neutrino-less Double Beta Decay (NDBD) experiments may provide an intriguing direction for extensions of the Standard Model, including lepton number violation by two units and a new Majorana mass term in quantum field theory unlike that of the Standard Model Higgs mass. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, it would be the only known fermion whose anti-particle is itself. The absolute scale of neutrino masses can also be uniquely determined via such experiments. These are fundamental questions of modern physics. \r\n\r\nThis award will enable the UCLA group to continue their research program in the CUORE NDBD experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory. The experiment is currently in the construction phase and is expected to start data-taking by the end of 2014. The UCLA research effort will focus on the quality assurance of the CUORE electronics system and on the understanding of background sources. They will be responsible for testing, installation and commissioning of the CUORE electronics system in collaboration with the University of South Carolina and Milan groups. They will continue to work on the Monte Carlo simulations of the CUORE-0/CUORE background sources. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact\r\nThe NDBD experiments address fundamental physics issues that have a scientific impact much beyond particle and nuclear physics. The CUORE bolometer detector represents a major advance of detector technology in neutrino sciences and is probably the best alpha detector with a FWHM resolution of a few kiloelectronvolt (keV), which may have applications in nuclear radiation measurements for physics and other applied sciences. They will continue to involve their undergraduate students and NSF-REU students in the research programs and provide them with research experiences in neutrino physics and modern detector technology.",
