 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from the University of Florida proposes to derive and develop a network and community of practice (CoP) among amateur and professional paleontologists across the country. Should this project be successful, it would put together 40 professional Paleontologist with 23 amateur Paleontology clubs across the country. The advantage of this organization would be to facilitate sharing of specimens (digitally on the web), educating each other, and most important, making the public outreach from each club more effective. While each club has specimens, this network would provide access to over 100 million digitized samples. The web-base for this collection will be managed at the University of Florida under the direction of the PI. The research portion of this project will determine what the essential elements necessary are for effective learning between professionals and amateurs and how the CoP enhances amateur learning and outreach efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe project plan includes a centralized organization to initially form the community of practice, call general meetings, publish newsletters and organized a large meeting at the University of Florida in the coming year. Further, the project team will conduct evaluation on how the project is helping members develop and how the organization can be improved.\r\n\r\nEducating individuals in the field of paleontology is generally a positive experience. This project will facilitate knowledge building among the individual members of the clubs, which will enhance their perspective and enable them to reach out to members of their communities. The project will be evaluated at every level to ensure that the existing clubs are incorporated into the project and new clubs are welcomed and engaged as well.",

The goal, therefore, of the FOSSIL project was to develop a national learning \"community of practice\" (CoP) in which members of fossil clubs, other independent amateurs, and professional paleontologists, mostly from the U.S. (but not exclusively) could share knowledge about the science and practice of paleontology via an online forum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The learning research conducted during the FOSSIL project allows a better understanding of how individuals in this CoP acquired knowledge and communicated with one another in this national network. Our research conducted during FOSSIL not only informed our project, but can also help similar informal learning networks in the future. During the project period (2013 to 2019), technology and means of social communication evolved rapidly, e.g., with the advent of social media and mobile apps. Our project was therefore influenced by these innovations, some of which were implemented. Our original means of communication included a listserv (no longer exists), e-newsletter, and website; this rapidly evolved into a community in which social media became the dominant mediator of networking. We experimented with monthly webinars, but these never became very popular. We learned that trying to \"drive\" traffic to a central platform, such as the website, does not work and that the FOSSIL community is composed of individuals coming to it from different means, of which more than 80% is from social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). As can be seen in Fig. 1, while the website, Facebook, and Twitter both experienced steady growth within the community, Instagram, which was implemented midway in the project, resulted in explosive growth. Today, our FOSSIL community consists of more than 10,000 participants, with the bulk connecting via social media.</p>\n<p>The online presence described above was augmented by \"in-person\" activities. FOSSIL and fossil clubs organized fossil collecting field trips that were popular and succeeded in building the community through personal (as opposed to virtual) interactions. With support from the FOSSIL project, some members of the amateur community actively participated in professional meetings, e.g., the North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC; 2014 in Gainesville, FL and 2019 in Riverside, CA) via presenting talks, posters and panel discussions. Of FOSSIL's 10,000-member community, the large majority (~90%) consist of amateurs; for a variety of reasons professionals did not join the community in such large numbers. Nevertheless, many of the professionals were active participants.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to bring younger members into the FOSSIL community, we (1) started Instagram, and (2) developed a mobile app. Our data show that the overall demographics of our community shifted. Before these interventions, the community was skewed towards middle age and seniors. After the establishment of Instagram and development of the myFOSSIL app, our demographic increased in the younger age range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The FOSSIL project has a core value of Broader Impacts by virtue of its outreach for societal benefit among lifelong learners. The FOSSIL project resulted in more than 45 talks presented at national professional meetings, 10 papers published or submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and provided content for the book \"Broader Impacts of Science on Society\" (MacFadden 2019) published by Cambridge University Press. With regard to human resource development, about 10 graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows benefitted from their associations with the FOSSIL community. Studies have shown that many STEM interest groups tend not to be diverse. Nevertheless, the FOSSIL project did have gender balance, impacted rural underserved audiences, and had some Latinx participants. Our ability to impact more diverse participants came through active recruiting, e.g., in some teacher outreach events organized by the FOSSIL project (Fossils4Teachers; Pirlo et al. 2018, Fig. 2).</p>\n<p>Our FOSSIL project was designed to have sustainable components after the NSF funding ended on 1 October 2019. These include the: (1) the website; (2) social media; and (3) mobile app. An important outcome has also been the online \"myFOSSIL e-museum\" of specimens collected by the community (but not currently held in an official repository). If specimens are uploaded with appropriate research grade data, then they are potentially available to big-data providers such as iDigBio and GBIF. These public participants are thus contributors to one of NSF's areas of emphasis, i.e., the big data revolution. Despite the end of NSF funding, we continue to add about 100 new members per month to the community. It is envisioned that the platform that myFOSSIL enables and the social interactions that have resulted from this project will continue as a lasting indication of the impact of NSF's investment in the national community of lifelong learners interested in fossils and paleontology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bruce&nbsp;J&nbsp;Macfadden</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1322725/1322725_10283238_1576598104706_Fossils4TeachersGroup_Picture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1322725/1322725_10283238_1576598104706_Fossils4TeachersGroup_Picture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2.
