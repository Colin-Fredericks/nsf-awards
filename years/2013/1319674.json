 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for approximately 26 students to attend the 2013 SIAM Data Mining (SDM 2013) Conference (and the Doctoral Student Forum) that is being organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in cooperation with the American Statistical Association. SDM 2013 is being held in Austin, Texas, USA from May 2 to 4, 2013. The Doctoral Forum  will consist of a poster session for Ph.D. candidates in data mining or closely related areas or Ph.D. students who have made significant progress towards Ph.D. candidacy. The Ph.D. student forum participants will be able to present their work, interact with their peers from other universities as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. In addition, they will attend the technical sessions, plenary talks, and tutorials and workshops of their choice at the conference. Each student will be assigned a senior researcher to serve as a mentor on a variety of career-related issues.\r\n\r\nParticipation in premier research conferences in data mining is an integral component of the training of Ph.D. students in data mining. The SDM 2013 Doctorul Student Forum is aimed at providing an opportunity for Ph.D. candidates to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers in data mining. Such feedback and mentoring is expected to improve the quality of the students thesis research. Similarly, student recipient of a travel award will be able to attend technical sessions, plenary talks, panels, tutorials and workshops. They will interact with peers who share similar interests from other universities, as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. This experience will be extremely formative and fruitful towards the shaping of their future research endeavors.\r\n\r\nData mining is playing an increasingly important role in many emerging data-rich sciences and application domains, such as healthcare informatics, bioinformatics, computational biology, link analysis, counterterrorism and security. The SDM 2013 Doctoral Student forum will enrich the education and training of student researchers at early stages in their careers.  Attendance in SDM 2013 will expose students to cutting-edge research and to relevant applications in a variety of domains. The travel awards will help broaden the participation of women and members of under-represented  groups within the Data Mining research community.",
