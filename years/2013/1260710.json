 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nIntellectual Merit. Communities of Fe-oxidizing Bacteria (FeOB) are common at sites of hydrothermal venting and are known to form complex communities in microbial mats, hydrothermal sediments, oceanic crustal basalts and borehole fluids (among others) that are iron-rich and low in oxygen. Studies from sites around the Pacific Ocean have found the Zetaproteobacteria to be ubiquitous members of these FeOB communities. Previously, borehole fluids from the Southern Mariana Backarc have been shown to support several novel and distinct lineages of endemic Zetaproteobacteria. Sampling from the deep subsurface at the Iheya North hydrothermal field (IODP Expedition 331) explores this deep subsurface FeOB biodiversity and has resulted in multiple enrichments using both microaerophilic and anaerobic culturing conditions. Zetaproteobacteria have been detected at levels up to 13% of the total bacterial community from these subsurface core samples. This project expands post-cruise analyses to focus on assessing these FeOB subsurface communities using a combined single cell genomics, community-level metagenomics and a FeOB directed cultivation approach. This approach will allow insights into the exclusive physiology and metabolism of these Zetaproteobacteria thereby demonstrating key features as to how they survive, compete and grow within these complex subsurface microbial communities. A comparative analysis (from an evolutionary standpoint) to determine the unique differences between subsurface Zetaproteobacteria and those living above the seafloor surface is an integral part of this effort.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. A better understanding of Zetaproteobacteria is of central interest to scientists interested in areas of earth science and oceanography because they illustrate how microbes can influence geochemical cycling and mineral deposition. Furthermore, morphological structures similar to those produced by Zetaproteobacteria can still be identified 100's of millions (and possibly billions) of years back in the rock record, making them of paleontological (and potentially of exobiological) interest. As knowledge of extant populations grows, it is possible they will also help to inform us of environmental change in past Earth history. From a practical standpoint, these organisms might be thought of as 'micro-machines', spinning out threads of iron oxyhydroxide that coalesce in unknown ways. These oxides are known to be highly reactive with a range of other metals, organic compounds, and nutrients, thus impacting many other biogeochemical cycles. In particular, this study allows the opportunity to compare and contrast a known monophyletic class of Proteobacteria, to study the differences between subsurface and supersurface lineages of Zetaproteobacteria, thereby yielding fundamental clues into microbial biogeography. A wealth of educational outreach opportunities will be made possible by this work, including graduate education, research experiences for undergraduates, and teacher training.",

Project Title - RUI: Iron-oxidizing Bacteria from the Okinawa Trough Deep Subsurface Biosphere. We have documented the occurrence of unique <em>Zetaproteobacteria</em> residing in the deep subsurface as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program's (IODP) expedition 331 to hydrothermally active mounds in the Okinawa Trough. Through the use of single amplified genomes (SAGs), we have extended the metabolic potential of another understudied group of subsurface microbes, the <em>Chloroflexi</em>. These microbes are frequently detected in the subsurface biosphere, though their metabolic capabilities have remained elusive. In contrast to previously examined <em>Chloroflexi</em> SAGs, our genomes (several are from the order <em>Anaerolineales</em>) were recovered from a hydrothermally driven system and therefore provide a unique window into the metabolic potential of this type of habitat. In addition, a reductive dehalogenase gene (<em>rdhA</em>) has now been directly linked to marine subsurface <em>Chloroflexi</em>, suggesting that reductive dehalogenation is not limited to the class <em>Dehalococcoidia</em> as previously thought. This discovery expands the nutrient-cycling and metabolic potential present within the deep subsurface and provides functional gene information relating to this enigmatic group. Finally, we also conducted an analysis of the biogeography of <em>Thermococcus</em> isolates originating from the subsurface. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used to resolve genomic differences in 90 isolates of <em>Thermococcus</em>, making biogeographic patterns and evolutionary relationships apparent. The biodiversity identified in our <em>Thermococcus</em> isolates and presence of distinct lineages within the same vent site suggests the utilization of varying ecological niches in this genus. In addition to resolving their biogeographic patterns, this study has raised new questions about the closely related <em>Pyrococcus</em> genus. To better understand what functional genes and metabolic traits are found in the genomes of our <em>Thermococcus</em> isolates, we have used Illumina sequencing of representative members of all clades with an eventual goal of establishing a baseline of common genes, i.e., characterizing the <em>Thermococcus</em> pan-genome. A postdoctoral researcher, four graduate students, and six undergraduates were supported. Three publications have resulted from this project and are cited below (another is currently in preparation). In addition, seven presentations have been made at both national and international scientific meetings based on results from this project.<br /><br />Refs Cited:</p>\n<p>Fullerton, H. and C. L.
