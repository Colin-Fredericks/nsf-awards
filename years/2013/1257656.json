 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells, or neurons, are specialized cells of the nervous system that receive and send signals to coordinate animal behavior. Dendrites are the highly branched structures of neurons that are used to gather sensory information from other cells or the environment. These dendritic branches are critical for the function of the nervous system because a loss of dendrites is associated with deficits in learning, motor control, and sensory perception. The goal of this project is to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate dendrite development. Dendrite development will be investigated in the simple genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, a microscopic round worm because it is completely transparent, enabling the observation of dendrite development in living animals, and because it is high amenable to genetic manipulation. The research will focus on a genetic analysis of a class of proteins called RNA-binding proteins, which are hypothesized to be important in dendrite development because they regulate genetic messages known as messenger RNAs. This research project is expected to identify several specific RNA-binding proteins, present in worms and other species including humans, which are important for regulating dendrite development. Furthermore, the research is expected to determine the molecular mechanisms for how these RNA-binding proteins regulate dendrites. This research will impact the field of developmental neuroscience because it will provide a better understanding of how the individual neurons make the connections that allow for a functional nervous system that responds to the environment and controls behavior. This project will also have an impact on student training and public awareness; Colorado College and the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs will collaborate on this research project and train several undergraduates and master students, incorporate this research into undergraduate courses, and participate in community outreach programs to illustrate the importance of developmental neuroscience research.",

Since neuronal shape is important for nervous system function, it is important to understand which genes regulate the size, branching complexity, and pattern of dendrites. Previously, we found that many genes that encode proteins that bind RNA (RNA-binding proteins or RBPs) contribute to dendrite development in the fruit fly, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (Olesnicky et al. 2014). Motivated by these results, we obtained NSF funding to determine the extent to which evolutionarily conserved RBPs regulate dendrite development across species using sensory neurons in the fruit fly and the roundworm (<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>) as models. Through our genetic study, we identified 12 conserved RBPs that regulate dendrite development in fruit flies and worms, suggesting common genes regulate dendrites across species. Moreover, human versions of these RBPs are expressed in the brain, suggesting they may also impact human dendrite development. We also gained evidence that these RBPs participate in molecular processes such as RNA splicing, RNA localization, and translational regulation &ndash; all of which impact gene expression. These results were published in <strong><em>G3: Genes-Genomes-Genetics</em> (Antonacci et al. 2015).</strong> We next examined one pair of conserved RBPs more closely: Shep<em> </em>in flies and SUP-26 in worms. Loss of these RBPs results in defects in multiple neuron types, suggesting a broad requirement for Shep/SUP-26 in neural development. This work was published in <strong><em>Development, Genes and Evolution</em> (Schachtner et al 2015).</strong> The Olesnicky lab also found that Caper, another RBP, plays a role in regulating alternative splicing in neurons, the loss of which results in aberrant dendrite development. This work was published in <strong><em>Developmental Dynamics</em> (Olesnicky et al 2017).</strong> Our NSF-funded research was presented at The American Society for Cell Biology Annual Meeting (2013 and 2014), The Society for Developmental Biology Southwest Regional Meeting (2014), The Society for Developmental Biology Annual Meeting (2015), The Rocky Mountain Regional Neuroscience Group Meeting (2015 and 2016), The Front Range <em>Drosophila</em> Meeting (2015), a Keystone Symposium on RNA Processing and Disease (2017), several regional undergraduate conferences, and at multiple academic institutions in Colorado.
