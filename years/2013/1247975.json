 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) region constitutes the Earth's upper atmosphere that is part of larger Geospace environment, and ITM is a portal upon which the solar wind energy and momentum enter and impact the entire Geospace domain. Though space weather research over the past decade or so has greatly increased understanding of a wide variety of phenomena associated with the ITM physics, the sum of these individual processes occurring in Geospace does not replicate the rich diversity and scope of this complex region. Thus a more holistic approach to the ITM research is necessary, one that integrates clustered instrumentation at multiple locations to have a simultaneous look at the solar wind interactions within the entire Geospace system. This project will support studies of interrelated ITM phenomena observed at high latitudes through the coordinated and collaborative instruments deployed across Antarctica. Specifically, the project will focus on continued operation of a suite of geospace instrumentation currently deployed at both the South Pole (SPA) and McMurdo (MCM) stations. This suite has a sustained track-record of robust operation and community support: ground-based fluxgate and search-coils magnetometers, ELF and VLF receivers, imaging and broadband riometers, sky-looking optical systems, scintillation GPS receivers, and a number of other instruments. Data from this suite will be synergistically combined to study: (a) synoptic variability of the magnetospheric open-closed boundary (OCB) and associated cusp structures (utilizing fluxgate, photometer, and all-sky imager data); (b) simultaneous ELF whistler events at SPA and MCM and their relationship to ionospheric conditions (using ELF receiver, fluxgate, and GPS data); and (c) auroral and polar cap GPS signal scintillation occurrence, strength, and relationship with the ITM activity (using GPS, fluxgate, riometer, imager, ELF/VLF data). These particular topics are only a partial listing of the work that can, and will, be performed with the data obtained from these instruments, especially via established and planned collaborations with other geospace projects taking place in the Antarctica and at magnetically conjugate regions in the Arctic. These include (but not limit) the MCM lidar system, southern hemisphere SuperDARN radars, Fabry-Perot interferometers, balloon campaign, etc. The project will be utilizing (and also providing) data from/to in-orbit satellites, namely the THEMIS suite of spacecraft and recently launched RBSP spacecraft. This will make use of the ground- and space-based data to provide the science context to proposed observations and reveal new insights into underlying physics of the geospace phenomena. The project will train and educate young scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this effort were to combine the various disparate geospace instrumentation currently located at South Pole station (SPA) and McMurdo station (MCM) into one unified system, with a common data acquisition (DAQ) system for data transmission.  Such an effort was motived by the desire to study the Antarctic ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) region as a coupled, synoptic system; an approach which has been encouraged and outlined in recent NSF-CEDAR and NSF-GEM strategic plans.  The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) was to be the lead in this collaborative effort.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, we proposed to install new instrumentation at SPA and MCM to further geospace science.  Each of collaborating institutions in this Collaborative Proposal would spearhead various new instrumentation, namely the University of New Hampshire (UNH) would lead the ELF installation efforts at MCM, John Hopkins University-Applied Physic Laboratory (JHU-APL) would spearhead the installation of 3 GPS systems at SPA, and NJIT/Merrimack College (formally Siena College) would spearhead the installation of new photometers at both SPA and MCM.\n\n \n\nThe details of the significant results resulting from this project largely involve the publication of professional [peer-reviewed] papers and presentations, most all relating to geospace science associated with the instruments located at SPA and MCM stations.  That is, the teams here have utilized data at both of these stations to, for example, better understand polar scintillation structure and occurrence, to understand the synoptic variability of the magnetic field open-closed boundary, to look at pulsating and ULF-modulated aurora, and to study ELF propagation throughout the polar ionosphere.

Both are now successfully employed.  In addition, over 4 Master graduate students have been supported, in part, by the efforts supported herein.  Furthermore, numerous undergraduate students have been involved with this effort.  To wit, at NJIT undergraduate students have been extensively involved with \"engineering systems development\" associated with instrument department, testing, operation, and data reduction. The ability for these students to work with Antarctic instrument deployments is additionally unique because NJIT does not have a \"spacecraft program\".  Thus, instrument development for the Antarctic is the closest thing replicating such an experience.  In addition, the data reduction aspects of this effort have enabled many of our undergraduates to work in \"Big Data\", and they have leveraged this experience to acquire successful employment on graduation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Gerrard"
