The investigators will use these telescopes to construct maps of molecular emission to study how massive star environments affects star and planet formation with a focus on the regions within 50-200 astronomical units (AU) of the host star. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts training two graduate students using the relatively new ALMA observatory, producing an audio-visual fly-through of the Orion star-forming region to share with the public what they learn and working with high school students to produce other multimedia presentations.",
