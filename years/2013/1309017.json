 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI), Professors Martin Fischer, Warren Warren, Robert Opila, Dr. Jennifer Mass and their groups will develop multi-wavelength nonlinear optical microscopy techniques for the extraction of novel molecular contrast at microscopic resolution from highly scattering materials ranging from biological tissue to historical artwork. This team has recently extended microscopy methods originally developed for skin imaging to historical pigments, demonstrating non-destructive, high-resolution structural and chemical contrast in historic painting cross sections and an intact painting. This interdisciplinary study between museum conservators and academic researchers will focus on making this a broadly useful method for imaging both biomedical tissue and historic works of art: the study will broaden the range of accessible contrasts and documented pigments, demonstrate high quality imaging with maximum flexibility, and build a portable device. This work integrates seemingly disparate fields (molecular imaging, analytical chemistry, laser spectroscopy, fundamental nonlinear optics, and biomedical engineering) to address fundamental questions impacting medical imaging and cultural heritage.  In the studies of artworks the use of nonlinear optical microscopy has been hindered by the lack of useful image contrast in highly complex layers of paint (most of which do not fluoresce).  Pulse shaping and pulse train shaping technology, recently developed for biomedical imaging, now provides access to weaker but more pigment-specific structural and molecular contrast, which could help determine authenticity, provenance, technology of manufacture, and state of preservation.\r\n\r\nThis program could dramatically impact biomedical imaging and conservation science by providing a non-invasive imaging modality that can extract comprehensive structural and chemical information from these highly scattering environments, complementing established mapping techniques.  Students involved will have access to the laser labs at Duke University, the NC Museum of Art Conservation Center and the Winterthur facilities; in turn NCMA and Winterthur staff will actively participate in the imaging studies.  This exchange will encourage interdisciplinary inquiry between scientists, conservators, curators, and educators.  The program will result in training opportunities in an interdisciplinary environment spanning conservation science, art history, physics, chemistry and engineering for graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.",
