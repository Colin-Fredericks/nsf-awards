The proposed FESEM will enable UM investigators with diverse scientific specialties to develop high-impact research projects not currently achievable at UM and its regional partner institutions.  Materials science projects will yield novel and diverse materials and devices with potential practical applications, including microwave devices using novel ferrite-based magnetoelectric nanocomposites, flexible metal-polymer based strain gauges, improved chitosan scaffolds for tissue engineering, stable hydrogels with controlled pore structure for drug delivery, nanocapsule-based optical sensing devices with extended life time and ultra-short response time, and hybrid nanomaterials with dual magnetic/optical properties for biomolecular sensing. In cell biology, the FESEM will produce fundamental understanding of the role of cytoskeletal linkers in structuring the cytoplasmic space. In geology, investigations of nanoscale metal binding on fine-grained soils and sediments will be possible as will archaeometric and taphonomic studies aimed at identifying the origin(s) of archaeological samples and fossil deposits.",
