 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many plant communities, the most important interactions occur below ground. It is here that up to 80% of the plant mass is located, as roots, and these roots play a significant role in determining the composition and diversity of species in plant communities. Understanding belowground community structure and the mechanisms of root competition has been hampered, to date, by the inability to identify roots by species.  This research will develop DNA markers to identify species and quantify their abundance in mixed root samples.  These markers will be validated in a set of experiments addressing fundamental questions about how root competition, particularly for spatially patchy resources, affects individual plant foraging behavior and the diversity and relative abundance of species in mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe molecular methods developed will provide essential tools for other research that requires an understanding of belowground structure in plant communities. This work will strengthen interdisciplinary partnerships by bringing together faculty specializing in ecology and genomics. Also, four students, three undergraduates and one graduate student, will conduct original research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe study of how plant roots interact and how plant species compete for resources in the soil is difficult because roots all look alike.  When examining root growth in a particular volume of soil, it is generally not possible to identify which roots belong to which plant species.  The main goal of this project was to develop molecular techniques for determining which species have roots in a mixed sample, and what proportion of the roots belong to each species.  We started with a set of more than twenty weedy species that grow together in old fields, and aimed to develop molecular markers that would identify roots of each of the species.  Our initial technique was only partially successful, but by changing our approach we have been able to develop successful markers for three species, with five more nearing completion.  We plan to continue applying the new approach to the remaining species.\n\n \n\nThe markers will allow us to address questions about root growth strategies plants use to compete.  For example, plants grown alone grow more roots in resource-rich patches, but species differ in their ability to forage in this way.  With markers, we will be able to ask whether foraging changes when competitors are present, and whether foraging leads to competitive success.  We completed several small pilot competition experiments and have stored root samples for later analysis.  We have also measured a number of traits related to nutrient uptake and growth for a subset of twelve species, to see how these traits are related to foraging and competitive ability.\n\n \n\nAs a result of this project, a new technique for identifying roots in the soil has been developed.  A set of traits related to plant growth, including foraging ability, have been measured and will be submitted to online databases.  Four students (two women and two underrepresented minorities) have conducted authentic research as part of their undergraduate education; one of these students has moved on to a graduate program.  One graduate student has taken the lead on this project and will complete her master\u00c6s degree next year.  We anticipate three publications from this project (one describing marker development, one based on trait measurements, and one applying the markers to a competition experiment), to be co-authored by the graduate student and one or more of the undergraduates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tara K Rajaniemi"
