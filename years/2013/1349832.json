 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The proposed project seeks financial support for a one-day Workshop on Silicon Photonic Integrated Devices Open-Access Foundry / Fabrication Facility to be held at the OSA Headquarters in Washington DC in September 2013. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Workshop is to discuss the needs for a U.S. based open-access fabrication facility for photonic integrated circuits. Discussion at the workshop will provide further specific guidance on materials, the range of processes, and integration. The Workshop involves a sequence of invited talks and open discussions concluding with a closed session for government invitees only. Possible models for a U.S. based fab facility, and corresponding funding / operating requirements will be discussed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The Workshop will bring together leading experts in optoelectronics to discuss the low-volume, but scalable, manufacturing of state-of-the-art photonic devices, including those critical to communications infrastructure, large-data networks, metrology, sensors, and imaging. Key speakers are to describe cutting-edge silicon photonic technology with decision makers from government laboratories, industry and funding agencies. The exchange of ideas and collaboration possibilities are expected to facilitate consensus and serve the research needs of the silicon photonics community and training of a US workforce in this area. Initiatives generated a result of this Workshop will benefit the ongoing research and training of graduate students across the country, the efforts of small businesses, as well as the largest industrial concerns in this research area.",
