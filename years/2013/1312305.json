The models will be constrained by direct images of exoplanets produced by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and other surveys.  The researchers will focus on non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud physics, atmospheric structure and predict emission spectra of the planets.  They will also use the direct imaging data to determine atmospheric effective temperature, surface gravity and composition.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include contributions to university public web pages on science topics, videos called \"Science Bulletin Features\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History, and mentoring and supervising a female graduate student in her Ph.D. dissertation research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur work was the development of detailed chemical models in order to better understand the underlying chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere that give rise to the observed properties of exoplanets.  A main product of this work was the production of detailed chemical model grids that give the chemical behavior of key atmospheric species as a function of temperature, pressure, elemental abundance, and elemental abundance ratios in exoplanet atmospheres.  Another major product of this work was the development of cloud formation models in the atmospheres of \"hot Jupiters\".  A major focus of this study was young exoplanetary systems that provide excellent opportunities for direct imaging and/or spectroscopic resolutions much higher than typically available for exoplanet investigations, although a wide range of objects continue to be described by the model grids.\n\nThe importance of the model grids is that they describe the chemical behavior of different atmospheric constituents over a very wide range of possible planetary conditions.  The results can therefore be used by other investigators for detailed comparisons between the chemical models and the observational properties of exoplanet atmospheres &ndash; in other words, to determine whether the properties of known planets can be explained by a particular atmospheric model with specific chemical and physical parameters.   These model-data comparisons provide important constraints on bulk composition and thus also provide important clues about the formation and evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems.\n\nWe also used our models to better understand the role of clouds over a very wide range of planetary conditions, from icy methane clouds in ice giant planets in the outer reaches of the Solar System to high-temperature refractory clouds in the upper atmospheres of \"super-hot Jupiter\" exoplanets.  Cloud formation may strongly affect the observational properties of planetary atmospheres by removing of species from the gas phase, obscuring features from deeper levels, adding new absorption features, and scattering incoming radiation.  In addition to the development of detailed condensate models for model-data comparisons, the mechanism and role of cloud formation in planetary environments was discussed in public talks (including \"Cloudy with a chance of metal rain\") and incorporated into upper-level undergraduate chemistry courses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Channon Visscher"
