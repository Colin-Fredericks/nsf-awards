 "awd_abstract_narration": "This integrated research and implementation project would advance the understanding of how interconnected transmedia platforms build children's motivation to take part in Citizen Science and contributes to girl's science self-identify. This project would deepen the engagement of girl's in Citizen Science projects by leveraging the success of SciGirls, the transmedia TV and web series, as well as other NSF investments in citizen science evaluation methods and instruments.\r\n\r\nProject deliverables include 6 Citizen SciGirls TV programs for PBS broadcast and online streaming; Spanish translations; a mobile citizen science app; a SciGirls web portal for each featured Citizen Science project; activity guides and outreach.  Project partners include the National Girls Collaborative Project (4-H, Girls, Inc., and Girl Scouts among others) that will conduct national outreach, and AAAS that will develop the open source SciGirls app.\r\n\r\nThe research component will build on the NSF funded DEVISE project adapting the Citizen Science research instruments for use with younger audiences.  Research questions include:  Does audience identification with media characters influence participation in Citizen Science Projects?  Does watching Citizen SciGirls programs influence development of science identity among girls?  What role do demographic factors (ethnicity /age/gender) have in influencing learning outcomes and participation in Citizen Science projects?\r\nThe formative evaluation will apply iterative small-group studies of the transmedia deliverables in order to improve the user experience and learning outcomes.  The summative evaluation will focus on in-depth observational, non-experimental studies of selected groups of girls in afterschool settings.\r\n\r\nThe reach of the project will be extensive via PBS with a projected broadcast coverage of 90% of TV households and a million unique online users of the games and apps.  Projected learning outcomes include girl's increased knowledge and interest in science and the environment, their skills of science inquiry, and behavior change resulting from participation in Citizen Science projects.",
