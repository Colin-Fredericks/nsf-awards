 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will optimize the fabrication of an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) to address the needs of drop-foot patients. These patients are unable to dorsiflex their foot because of impaired muscle activity around the ankle. The project team has developed a prototype orthosis using a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuator. The actuator captures and releases energy during walking to provide dorsiflexion motion, which drop-foot patients' lack.  The proposed research includes performing methodical study toward achieving super-elastic behavior in shape memory parts created using selective laser melting and developing a proof of concept shape memory hinge to capture and release energy to the ankle without the need to external sources of energy.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed research could have a significant impact on the advancement of active ankle foot orthosis. Every year a large number of individuals experience a loss of ability to dorsiflex the ankle due to disease or traumatic injury to the lower extremity that resulted from automobile accident or work-related causes. Of particular note, these last two conditions associated with foot drop (traumatic brain injury and traumatic lower extremity injury) are very common among soldiers.",
