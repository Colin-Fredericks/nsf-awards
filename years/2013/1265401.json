This minisymposium focuses on developing, investigating, and applying fundamental mathematical theories and advanced modeling and simulation techniques to various multiphysics and multiscale problems, especially fluid-structure interactions.  Key scientific questions addressed in this session have a wide range of applications, including magnetorheological fluids, aerodynamics, biomedical applications, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and ground water modeling.\r\n\r\nThis special session supports participation of students, postdocs, and junior researchers from the United States, who are working in areas related to the modeling and simulation of fluids, structures, and their interactions. The workshop environment promotes contacts  between researchers from the United States and other countries, including theorists and experimentalists from applied mathematics, computational science and engineering. Mutually beneficial discussions between junior and senior researchers and mathematicians and engineers are expected.  The special session is mainly organized by junior researchers and, along with other young participants, makes their research highly visible to the rest of the scientific community, providing them the access to various application fields for which they can contribute many advancements.",
