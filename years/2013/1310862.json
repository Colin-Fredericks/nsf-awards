 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atoms that interact strongly at low energy exhibit universal behavior that does not depend on details of atomic physics.  The development of methods for trapping atoms, cooling them to ultralow temperatures, and manipulating their interaction strengths has made universality of practical importance for controlling atoms and molecules.  The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the behavior of few-body and many-body systems consisting of strongly-interacting ultracold atoms and the weakly-bound molecules formed by these atoms.  Although this project is focussed primarily on ultracold atoms, universality ensures that the results will also be applicable to other fields of science, including nuclear physics, high energy physics, condensed matter physics, and astrophysics.\r\n\r\nThis award will be used primarily to support a graduate student who will be working on this research project.  The training received by the graduate student in carrying out the research will contribute to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation required by this project is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Eric Braaten completed a research project on ``universal'' aspects of ultracold atoms with\nlarge scattering lengths.  This work has broader impacts beyond atomic physics, because the \nuniversal aspects apply equally well to particles with short-range interactions in other \nsubfields of physics, even if their length scales and energy scales differ dramatically from \natomic scales.  The elucidation of universal aspects of few-body physics and many-body \nphysics has been one of the major themes in cold atom physics in the last decade.\n\n\nBraaten made several significant advances in the course of this research project.\n(a) Braaten made a breakthrough in calculating transition rates from an oscillating magnetic\nfield, which makes the interactions between atoms oscillate in strength.  He used it to derive \nsimple formulas for the rate for associating atoms into diatomic molecules in a thermal gas \nof atoms.\n(b) The first experiments on the unitary Bose gas, which consists of bosonic atoms whose \ninteractions are infinitely strong, were carried out by a group at JILA in 2014.  Braaten \nshowed that their measurements of the momentum distribution reveal evidence of \nlog-periodic oscillations associated with three-atom interactions.\n(c) The simplest universal properties of atoms correspond to taking the limit as the range of \nthe interactions between atoms goes to zero.  Systematic corrections can be obtained by \nexpanding in powers of the range.  Braaten deduced simpler expressions for the first-order\nrange corrections for bosonic atoms that will make it easier to apply them to cold atom \nexperiments.\n(d) Braaten also figured out how deeply inelastic reactions can be taken into account in an \neffective field theory for ultracold atoms through the Lindblad equation for the density matrix.\n\n\nBraaten has provided training for graduate students in theoretical physics applied to \nultracold atoms.  Christian Langmack completed his thesis research and received his PhD\ndegree in 2013.  Hudson Smith has completed his thesis research and is in the process of \nwriting his thesis.
