 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Alan D. Chapman has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at Stanford University.  This work aims to quantify crustal fluxes associated with shallow subduction by applying modern geo-/thermochronologic techniques (e.g., U-Pb geochronology, (U-Th)/He thermochronology, and fission track analysis) to the best recognized exposure of an ancient shallow subduction system on Earth, located in southern California.  The resulting dataset will be used to address: 1) regional issues pertinent to the North American Cordillera, most notably the relative importance of subduction erosion versus trench-linked transform faulting during the Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary Laramide orogeny and 2) global questions centered on processes by which crustal materials are recycled during shallow subduction (e.g., tectonic erosion, delamination, underplating, and magmatism).\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will directly engage faculty, postdocs, researchers, and students of active geo-/thermochronology and subduction zone tectonics groups at Stanford.  The results of this investigation will provide new insights into subduction dynamics, addressing questions of global importance regarding the life cycle of shallow subduction and the mechanisms of mass transfer between the crust and mantle. This project will deliver a wide range of data that address fundamental questions posed by the Subduction Cycles and Deformation initiative of the GeoPRISMS Program, the most pertinent of which concerns the origin and evolution of the continental crust.  The proposed education plan involves: 1) teaching a seminar on the topic of shallow subduction followed by a field course to Big Sur, California; 2) mentoring a high school intern through the Stanford High School Internship Program; and 3) maintaining an active outreach program through the GeoKids cooperative with the U.S. Geological Survey.",

Details of the institute can be found at the  following url: http://geoprisms.org/exterra/field-institutes/exterra-2014-salinia/.\n\n\nAt least 100 km and as much as 1000 km of slip has taken place along a poorly understood fault in central coastal California since the fault became active ~65 million years ago.  The major goal of this project was to test among hypotheses for the origin of this fault.  Was motion along the fault compressional, like large faults in the Himalaya, or strike-slip, like the San Andreas fault?  This project sought to address this question by doing fieldwork (to better understand the nature of the fault) and using various dating techniques (to better understand the timing and magnitude of offsetting along the fault).\n\nThe dataset resulting from this study has important implications for recognizing 1) how continental crust grows and changes in composition with time and 2) analogous systems in mountain belts worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan D Chapman"
