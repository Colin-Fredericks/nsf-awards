As a conventional TEM the instrument will enhance the current electron microscopy capabilities in teaching, user training and research. The capability to visualize structural changes at the sub-nanoscale level under operational environmental conditions will bring essential insights to many materials issues, such as the effect of dopants and impurities on processing and corrosion, defect (dislocation, grain boundaries and interface) migrations, thermally induced phase transformations, heterogeneous catalyses, nano-scale functional materials, and the environmental stability of materials in general.  The low accelerating voltage minimizes damage of oxide species and soft materials, thereby providing the ability to visualize the dynamics of polymers, tissue engineering, drug delivery, biomaterials and biomineralization.  This will be the first ETEM in the greater Western Pennsylvania area.  It will be housed at the University of Pittsburgh in the Swanson School of Engineering (SSoE) and will be a part of the Nanofabrication and Characterization Facility (NFCF) in the Peterson Institute of NanoScience and Engineering (PINSE). It will be linked to the electron microscopy facility in the Structural Biology department, School of Medicine. The NFCF is a user facility available to all national and international researchers.  The broad visibility and access to this instrument will contribute to nano- and meso-scale science and technology, biology, energy and sustainability research and to the training of post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students. This instrument will also be used in teaching courses in Electron Microscopy, Nano-characterization, Thin Films, Biomaterials, Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology. As a part of PINSE, it will contribute to the education of high school students and under-represented groups, especially African-American, as part of the NSF-Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) outreach program and Pitt Engineering Career Access Program (PECAP) program, respectively. \r\n******\r\nThis award from the Major Instrumentation program will support the installation of the first Environmental Transmission Electron Microscope (ETEM) in the greater Western Pennsylvania area. The instrument will be housed at the University of Pittsburgh in the Swanson School of Engineering (SSoE) as part of the Nanofabrication and Characterization Facility (NFCF), a user facility available to all national and international researchers. TEM is a powerful tool to visualize materials at the nanoscale and below. ETEM enables unique insights on the dynamic processing/structure/property relationships of nanomaterials  with impact in a broad spectrum of science and engineering areas, such as oxidation, corrosion, catalysis, nano-processing, bio-mineralization, tissue engineering and drug delivery.  The broad visibility and access to this instrument will contribute to nano- and meso-scale science and technology, biology, energy and sustainability research and education of post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students.

We have (and will continue) to foster much-needed research activities related to the dynamics of materials-related processes under various conditions <em>in situ</em> and establish a fundamental understanding of materials in ambient to extreme conditions of temperature and environments. Many materials systems have been characterized dynamically using this ETEM, a Hitachi H9500, at the University of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Some examples include the early stages of metal and metal alloy oxidation for fundamental understanding of corrosion needed to design corrosion resistant coating materials. The ETEM allows us to see catalysts under environmental conditions to gain essential insights into the structure-catalytic property relationship as well as to determine the range of environmental conditions (temperature and gas pressure) where the catalyst structure is stable and thus efficient.&nbsp; In addition, this instrument is routinely used for the characterization of DNA based nanostructures as it can be operated at low electron volt energy to minimize the damage to light materials, such as DNA. Two projects are highlighted (images).
