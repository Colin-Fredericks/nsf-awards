 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research asks how animals know whether and when to migrate and when to breed. The focal animal is a songbird in which populations with separate breeding ranges winter together but differ in whether or not they migrate. When spring arrives the non-migrants begin to breed, while the non-migrants delay breeding despite living in the same environment.  Research on the mechanisms that account for different responses to identical environments could help to explain how animals monitor the environment and adjust their physiology to their needs. The dark-eyed junco is a songbird and an ideal model to address these questions. \r\n\r\nThis project will investigate plasticity in hormone systems using hormonal \"challenges\" and pharmacological manipulations.  It will also explore differences in gene expression between resident and migratory juncos from recently diverged populations (California) and longer diverged populations (in Virginia) that over-winter together but breed in different places at different times. The prediction is that migrants will differ from residents in their response to challenges and that recently diverged populations will differ less than populations that diverged longer ago.  Another prediction is that gene expression in a common garden will differ between longer diverged populations as compared with recently diverged populations. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\nThe research will enhance understanding of why and how some animals are able to thrive in changing environments, while other animals' ranges retreat, and some species are lost. This research will provide numerous opportunities to train graduate and undergraduate students, and knowledge gained will be disseminated broadly.  The project will enable promotion of a documentary film starring the study species and designed for use in high schools and public venues for adult learners.  \r\n\r\nData Management.\r\nData supporting results in published papers will be made available on Genbank and/or Dryad. All data generated from this research will be archived in an online repository maintained by the Indiana University Library (https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/7911).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addressed how neuroendocrine mechanisms (brain and hormones) influence seasonal timing of migration and reproduction in birds. The results are highly relevant to predicting how vertebrate populations will respond to environmental change. They also address how natural selection on these mechanisms as a result of environmental change may lead to gains or losses in the number of species and thus biodiversity.\n\nBirds and most other animals that live in seasonal environments breed during summer when food is abundant.  During winter many species regress their reproductive organs, and some migrate after reproducing and avoid the cold and short days of winter found at higher latitudes.  In spring reproductive development begins again, and is regulated by a region of the brain known as the hypothalamus (H), which perceives changes in day length and other environmental cues and communicates that information via hormones to tissues found in other parts of the body, including the pituitary (P) and the gonad (G).  Collectively the H, P and G are known as HPG axis whose response to the environment culminates in renewed gonadal growth and preparation to reproduce. Some cues and signals accelerate gonadal growth; others delay growth and development.  The outcome of acceleration and delay is to match timing of reproduction to an environment that maximizes the likelihood of reproducing successfully.\n\nWe studied populations of birds that are incipient species.  They are closely related but differ in whether they migrate, and when they breed. In winter, migrants and residents live together.  In spring, migrants fly north before they breed.  Prior to departure, migrants live in the same environment with  residents. The result is a situation in which close relatives experience the same environment but respond differently, and thus a situation that is ideal for studying differences in the regulation of seasonal timing.\n\nBy comparing residents to migrants in the wild and in captivity at similar dates in March and April, we learned that the hypothalamus of residents is ?farther along? as indicated the abundance of gene products that promote gonadal growth.  Further, when those gene products were administered externally, the gonads of residents produced a stronger response than migrants as measured by production of testosterone by the gonad. The hypothalamus is a self-regulating tissue that stimulates testosterone production but it is also suppressed by the testosterone it stimulates in a process called negative feedback (much like a household thermostat turns off the furnace when it gets too warm).  We learned that sensitivity to negative feedback is greater in migrants, which helps to explain the role of the hypothalamus in delaying reproductive development in migrants. We also found within migrants, that individuals that make longer migrations were less reproductively developed than individuals that make shorter migrations. \n\nThese relationships are obviously dynamic, because later in the year when migrants have  flown north and completed reproductive development, they presumably resemble residents by exhibiting strong responses to stimulation by the hypothalamus and reduced negative feedback.  Still to be determined is how the brake on development in migrants is released, because we still know too little about how migratory physiology interacts with reproductive physiology.  One potential explanation that the adrenal gland serves as a brake on reproduction in migrants was not supported by our results. This is an area where much remains to be learned.\n\nIn sum, the results of this research indicate how genes acting in different tissues at different times of the year influence seasonal timing.  As the environment changes, growing warmer and less predictable, these genes may be turned on or off at different times in the future than they are now.  Whether that will result in earlier or later departure of migrants or earlier or later timing of reproduction in residents will have consequences for the likelihood of interbreeding between migrants and residents.  The outcome may be a collapse of incipient speciation or more rapid divergence between close relatives.  We are currently modeling these potential outcomes.\n\nThe broader impacts of the research were to prepare the next generation of scientists, post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students, in the responsible conduct of science.
