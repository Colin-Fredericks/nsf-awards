 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will target a taxonomic revision of the genus Orasema, a specialized group of ant parasites. Adult wasps lay their eggs away from the host in plant tissue, and their minute larvae use a variety of specialized behaviors to gain access to the ant nest and attack the ant brood. While common in some habitats, very little is known about these wasps. Using both molecular and morphological tools, this study will describe more than 170 species from North and South America, and provide a robust evolutionary hypothesis of their relationships. Research will focus on developing identification keys, and the study of their oviposition behavior, host associations and host preferences. \r\n\r\nOrasema attack some of the most invasive and pestiferous species of ants, including fire ants in the genera Solenopsis and Wasmannia, and the invasive Pheidole megacephala. A mature and sophisticated species-level taxonomy will help to better evaluate the potential of Orasema for use in biological control. Orasema belong to the Chalcidoidea, a megadiverse lineage of mostly parasitic wasps with more than 500,000 estimated species. Taxonomic expertise is desperately needed for this economically important group, and training will focus on novel methods to train new researchers and accelerate the descriptive process.",

They mate outside of the ant nest, and deposit their eggs away from their ant host, either in or on plant vegetation. Eggs hatch and the minute active first-instar larva, termed a planidium, about 0.12 mm in size, must find its way into the ant nest. They do this by various means, but it always involves a foraging adult ant worker. These minute larvae may be associated with fruit, extrafloral nectaries, potential prey of the ants (such as thrips) or may just attach to the wandering ants. Once on the ant, they appear to make their way to a special cavity in the ant mouthparts called the infrabuccal pouch. They are able to survive within the pouch and are able to be transferred from foraging ants to nurse ants (those that care for the ant larvae) to the ant larvae themselves. These planidia are then transferred to the ant larvae. Once on the larva, the planidium burrows into the host and waits for it to pupate. When pupation occurs, the planidium moves to the ventral region of the ant pupal thorax and begins to feed. After consuming the ant pupa, the wasp finishes development, pupates and eventually leaves the nest to finish the cycle.</p>\n<p>Research was focused on species in the eucharitid subfamily <strong>Oraseminae</strong>, which are specialized parasitoids of ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae, including pest ants such as the Red Imported Fire Ant (<em>Solenopsis</em>) and the Little Red Fire Ant (<em>Wasmannia</em>). Our results suggest that the group first originated in Africa and later spread into the New World in a single evolutionary event about 23-34 million years ago. Likely it crossed into the New World across a northern land bridge between Asia and North America during favorable climatic events at that time. In the New World, it had access to a vast new host resource in the Myrmicinae, and quickly spread and diversified onto a number of different ant genera. Over 12,000 specimens were examined and the genera were revised to reflect their relationships.

Species attacking some of the most pestiferous ants belong to unique groups of species, which can be used to postulate host integrity and assess species as biological control agents. While some species are highly host specific on both their plant and ant host, other species are generalists attacking different genera of ants and taking on morphological characteristics that reflect the size of the host.
