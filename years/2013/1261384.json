 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss actual data management implementation architectures and their application to discipline-specific workflows. This workshop thus builds on the results of the NSF funded data lifecycle management workshop held at Princeton University in 2011, shifting focus to implementations solutions. We will invite submission of position and experience papers that describe implementations of discipline-based data management infrastructure and services, and the ways in which those solutions leverage resources within and outside their institutions. The workshop will also engage participants in a discussion of how a coordinated effort among research computing centers may accelerate the implementation of effective research data management workflows, and contribute to national efforts and initiatives.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Collecting, moving, analyzing, sharing and preserving the appropriate data\r\nare fundamental to research. While many meetings and workshops have discussed best\r\npractices, too few meetings have focused on how data management plans are implemented for\r\ndifferent disciplines. The resulting lack of broadly applicable research data management\r\nmethods and implementations has led to a culture of one-off, institution-specific, and potentially\r\nunsustainable solutions; as well as the use of data structures and formats, organizational\r\nstructures, and/or metadata tagging approaches that are not maintainable or transferrable.\r\nRecommendations developed at this workshop will enable more effective coordination of data\r\nwithin and among institutions. This workshop will have a direct impact on the research\r\ncapabilities by sharing implementations and interoperable plans for research data management.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Collecting, moving, analyzing, sharing and preserving the appropriate data\r\nare fundamental to research.
