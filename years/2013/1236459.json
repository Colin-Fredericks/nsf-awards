The proposed approach is based on nanoscale engineering of the photoelectron processes by manipulation of potential profiles produced by InAs quantum dots with built-in charge in modulation-doped GaAs photovoltaic structures.  The research program is a collaborative effort of two research groups with complementary expertise from Universities at Buffalo and Albany (UB and UA); it includes design, fabrication, and systematic characterization of quantum dot solar cells. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nNanoengineering of photocarrier kinetics via tailoring the specific nanoscale potential is a novel original approach in photovoltaic conversion. By providing the needed fundamental and technological basis, this program develops effective ways for increasing the conversion efficiency.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe methodology and principles developed during this research will be applicable to a number of photovoltaic devices with quantum dots and nanocrystals. The project will also have broader impact through its contributions to education: (i) 1-2 week student exchange between the two Universities; (ii) for K-1 students, continuing development of modern electronics and nanotechnology laboratories; (iii) incorporation of the information technologies via Java Applets for energy conversion; (iv) continuing  participation in Robert McNair program for historically under-represented students; (v) promotion of  nanotechnology via interactive exhibit at the Buffalo Science Museum and various presentations at UB and UA.",
