 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mobility of teachers in schools is the focus of this project. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education are developing a system of indicators to measure the magnitude and impact of changes in school system staffing, a construct they call Ambient Positional Instability. The researchers are constructing case studies of school districts working within the context of an ongoing multi-site STEM experimental study. They are mapping the accessibility of teacher positional change data in 100 of the largest school districts in the United States, working with the Council of Great City Schools, to identify potential models of that data to better understand the phenomena. As a fourth component of the study, they are conducting a review of published reports on randomized trials and interviews with the authors to examine teacher instability that is not necessarily reported in those studies. The findings from this study inform a Campbell collaboration protocol for systemic review of the evidence.\r\n\r\nTeacher mobility is caused by reassignments to grades or subjects taught, promotions or demotions to non-teaching positions, and temporary appointments, as well as school leaving. Schools are frequently indicated as being very volatile environments with much turnover of staff and students a perennial problem. Yet the extent to which this is a problem has not been well characterized, and a system of indicators of this instability does not exist. This study provides such an indicator system and much potential use for both research and evaluation purposes. The instability in teacher positions has implications for the implementation of educational interventions. It affects the sensitivity of research and evaluation to detect the impact of interventions in experimental studies. In addition, teacher mobility has implications for policy decisions at the school, district, state and federal levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nReport for the General Public\n\nChurn and other Indicators of Instability among Public School Teachers \nRobert Boruch, University of Pennsylvania\nJanuary 20 2017 \nThe Research Goals\nThis research, sponsored by NSF, aimed to generate dependable evidence, based entirely on public data systems,  about Ambient Positional Instability (API) among teachers in public schools.   API includes shifts from year to year in what courses teachers teach, the shifts in the grades and subject courses that they teach, shifts in the schools in which they serve, conventional turnover such as leaving the profession, and shifts of other kinds.  \nThe Rationales for the Research\nHigh levels of Ambient Positional Instability among teachers has implications for the education of children. High churn among teachers, one may assume, is associated with discontinuity and instability in the schools.  The instability has implications for the management of school resource including induction/retention tactics and professional development experiences.  High levels of API also have implications for designing, and executing field tests of innovative STEM interventions in schools for analyzing test results, and for designing school based interventions that accommodate teachers? instability.\nDespite the fact that records are \"public,\" negotiation is often essential in accessing records. Understanding the records take intensive conversation with the custodians of the data systems.  \n The Research Results: Instability and Churn among Public School Teachers\nIn Missouri, about 75% of the 2006 cohort of STEM teachers in the State?s biggest cities public schools were in the same positions in the following year.  Ten years later only 30% were teaching the same subject at any public school in the state. By 2009, there was a 20 percentage point difference in between urban schools and the state?s rate.\nIn Ohio?s 2008 cohort of nearly 60,000 STEM teachers, 25% had left their initial positions to do something else by the following year, 2009.  Five years later, only about 50% of the teachers of the original 2008 cohort were in the same schools and teaching the same subjects.  Over a five year period, the year to year rate of shifting teachers from the same high school and grade and subject was 20-22% for the state, but the year to year shifts was 30-34%  for the biggest cities.\nIn Pennsylvania, only 20% of the 2008-2009 cohort of teachers remained in the same grade, school or teaching assignment five years later.  Over five years, about 50% of teachers stayed at the same school with the same math or science teaching assignments.  Instability rates for the cities are higher than for the state as a whole.\nOf the nearly 20,000 full time teachers in the 2007 cohort of teachers in Illinois, only about 8,700 remained in the same school 5 years later, yielding an instability rate of 57%.  Among high school STEM teachers in this cohort, only about 34-40% remain in the assignment and the same school five years later.  Chicago?s rates of instability are about 1.4 times the rate of the state as a whole. \nIn Arkansas, the initial cohort included all public school teachers who were employed in 2010.  Of this cohort, about 75% remained in the Arkansas system five years later, but retention is far lower in the biggest city.  Roughly 50% change the subjects that they teach each year over a five-year period.   The churn rate increases from 31% in 2011-12 to about 39% in 2014-15.  The big cities have a higher churn rate a t 40% than the state as a whole at 28% (Frisone et al 2015a and 2015b).\nOver 2 million public records were acquired on public school employees in New Jersey over an 18 year period. For the earliest cohort, 1996-97, the five year retention rate at the state level was 60%.  The year to year retention has been in the range 84% (women) to 90% (men).  The churn rate at the state level ranges from a high of down to about 20%.  Churn rates are highest for STEM as well as non-STEM teachers in 2008, reaching about 45%. As of this writing, big city schools have high instability rates.  \nThe Minnesota records involved records on nearly 32,000 full time public school teachers in the base year. Base year cohort retention at the State level after 5 years was about 70%: 30% go missing.  At the District level the retention is lower: 35% go to another place.  At the school level, only 42% are still in the same school to which they had been initially assigned five years earlier. Science teachers stay longer (70%) retention) and English and Foreign Language teachers are more mobile (59% retention).\nTo assure public access to reports, all have been posted on the University of Pennsylvania?s Scholarly Commons web site (http://www.repository.upenn.edu).
