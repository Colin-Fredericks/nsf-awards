 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe proposed effort will use modern integrated wavelength division multiplexing to minimize the\r\namount of external points of interface needed by optical probes while maximizing the total points of optical stimulation on an augmented electrophysiological neural recording probe. Array waveguide grating demultiplexers will be fabricated on neural probes and will be used to segregate multiple optical signals passed over a common fiber. The improvement of optical channel density will allow for more precise stimulation of local nuclei, enable high spatial and temporal multiplexing of selective stimulation of neurons and will allow for more flexibility when implanting neural probes. To allow for individual or multiple channels to be activated, the authors will build a ?polychromator? which will utilize a grating to separate spectral components from a broadband light source and project the spectrum onto a digital mirror device (DMD), similar to those found in digital projectors. Since the spectral information will be encoded spatially, spectral bands can be selected using the DMD by activating or deactivating columns of pixels. The resulting spectral bands will be collimated and used to provide a source with carefully controlled and manipulated spectral bands, allowing for direct spatial control of the stimulus through on-probe demultiplexing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOptogenetics provides unprecedented capabilities for manipulating neural activity with light.  Significant advances have been made over the past decade in the development of excitatory and inhibitory opsins for optical control of cellular processes.  Complementary methods for delivering light with cellular precision in vivo are also required to use these technologies to maximum effect. \n\nThis project focused on the development and validation of nanophotonic probes that employ the toolkit of integrated silicon photonics, adapted to visible wavelengths.  Our probes facilitate the technique of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which is exceptionally well-suited for optogenetic probes because typically the optogenetic actuators expressed in neurons respond to a relatively broad spectrum of light (~50nm); this permits accommodating many spectral channels within their absorption bands.  Additionally, unique assignment of different wavelengths to specifically located emitting pixels (termed E-pixels) can be accomplished using array waveguide gratings (AWGs; Fig. 1), which are passive components that don't generate excess heat. Our prototype devices (Fig. 1) feature minimally-invasive implantable shanks having cross-section dimension of less than 18um X 20um at the tip, and of about 18um X 90um at the base.
