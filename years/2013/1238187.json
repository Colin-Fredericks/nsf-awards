 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Jesse Poland (Kansas State University/USDA-ARS)\r\n\r\nCo-PIs: Kevin Price (Kansas State University)\r\n\r\nCollaborators: Michael Gore, Andrew French, Kelly Thorp, Jeff White (USDA-ARS); Pedro Andrade-Sanchez (University of Arizona); Allan Fritz, Randy Price, William Schapaugh, Stephen Welch, Naiqian Zhang (Kansas State University)\r\n\r\nThe essence of plant biology is to understand the link between genetic variation and observed phenotypes.  While genotyping can now be accomplished with low-cost, next-generation sequencing technologies, phenotyping is labor intensive and has become the limiting factor in plant biology studies and crop improvement programs. This project will develop transformational capacity for field-based high throughput phenotyping (HTP) by creating platforms for rapid assessment of multiple quantitative plant traits. Proximal sensing tools and GPS referencing will be integrated to develop mobile platforms that are low-cost, flexible, robust, and amenable for a range of species.  A central premise of this work is that integrating streams of data from multiple types of sensors will increase both the accuracy and number of traits that can be quantified for field grown plants. Thus, a second objective is to develop novel algorithms for analyzing HTP data to quantitatively estimate phenotypes expressed in field environments. The newly developed sensor systems, indexes, and algorithms will be applied in test cases that examine multiple quantitative traits in wheat, soybean and cotton. \r\n\r\nThe development of HTP platforms will complement the explosion of genomic information currently being collected and will enable field level experimental biology on a scale that has not been previously possible. Because the focus of this project is on field-based assessment of economically important crop species that represent different plant types and production systems, the platform and analytic methods developed in this project are expected to have broad application to a range of target environments and species and allow scalability for larger studies. The tools and methods developed will be transferred to the scientific community through hands-on training workshops. Training materials, equipment designs and software will be publicly available through a project website. This project will provide training for graduate and postgraduate scholars while hosting multiple internships for undergraduate engineering and plant science students in the field of HTP.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA central challenge in plant biology is understanding the genotype to phenotype (G2P) connection&mdash;how changes in an organism?s DNA sequence (the genotype) impact its observed characteristics (the phenotype), like plant height or leaf shape.  In agricultural plants, understanding the G2P has vast and broad implications that impact breeding and crop improvement and food production.  To understand the G2P and use this information for plant breeding, it is necessary to observe both the genotypes and the phenotypes in large populations to find associations between the two.  Driven by the medical genomics community, rapid advances in ?next-generation? high-throughput sequencing are making DNA sequencing data fast and cheap.  However, generating phenotype data has remained expensive and slow.  As a result, the lack of phenotype measurements of plant traits has become the limiting factor in plant genetics research.\n\nIn this project, we have developed the first generations of multiple field-based platforms for high-throughput measurements of plant traits, and repetitively tested them in a range of target environments on our target crops of wheat, cotton, and sorghum.  We developed both powered and push-cart type platforms, each integrating multiple types of plant sensors and a precision GPS unit, enabling accuracy and speed in the data collection and processing. This successful approach demonstrated the viability and potential of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms and has served as a foundation of HTP research for many groups around the world.  To manage and make the influx of data produced with these platforms timely and accessible for biological research, we developed data analysis pipelines that are transferable across crops and allow us to process and analyze the phenotype and genotype data in time to make breeding decisions within a crop season.\n\nIn the last phase of the project, we moved into the next frontier of HTP with the integration of the high-throughput image data and artificial intelligence.  Within broader areas of artificial intelligence, we implemented deep learning approach with convolutional neural networks&mdash;using the data, the network can \"teach\" itself over time to identify specific phenotypes and directly score complex plant traits in the field.  In traditional plant phenotyping, a breeder walks through the fields and gives a score to each plant trait. To train the neural networks, we combined breeder scores from the field with the high-throughput datasets.  Using these ?breeder-trained? networks, we have gained insight into measuring various types of plant traits as well as using high-throughput imaging throughout the field season to measure developmental traits, such as when the plant flowers.  We have conceptually demonstrated that this deep learning approach, using artificial intelligence on breeder-trained datasets, can potentially be extended to any trait in any species that is of interest.\n\nThe broad impact of this project to the scientific community has been extended by training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.  With advancements in the development of field-based HTP in plant genomics research, there is a need for parallel development of human capacity through education and outreach. We have integrated summer internships for undergraduate students from multiple disciplines, including engineering and plant science, and students from many different backgrounds including many under-represented minorities in STEM fields.  The project has also provided graduate student training and postdoctoral development, including new scientists who are now leading their own independent research groups.  Finally, the capstone of education and training through this project has been hosting workshops for HTP training at the Maricopa Agricultural Center in Maricopa, AZ.  These well-received workshops have provided hands-on for training students and scientist from universities, government and industry.  There have been a total of 7 workshops over the course of this project, providing training over 250 individuals. \n\nThe rapid and precise measurement of plant traits through HTP in these large field experiments has enabled new areas of plant breeding and genetics that were previously out of reach.  In this project, we laid some of the ?ground work? for field-based high-throughput phenotyping that is quickly extending to communities of practice around the U.S. and the world.  It is envisioned that these platforms and analysis approaches will enable scientists to ask entirely new research questions and for breeders to operate with new levels of speed and efficiency in developing improved crop cultivars to feed the world.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jesse A Poland"
