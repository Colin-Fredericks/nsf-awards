 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Michael Zuba of the University of Connecticut to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.  The project title is \"An Advanced Channel Model for Improved Underwater Acoustic Network Simulations.\" The host scientist is Dr. T.C. Yang.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this fellowship is in developing an advanced underwater acoustic communication framework for integration into an open-source network simulation tool.  The framework is validated against the results of real-world ocean environments using sea tests.  This work studies the effects of the physical environment, such as wind, noise (anthropogenic and natural), sea floor sediment types, the geometry of the network and the acoustic channel effects, such as multi-path, attenuation and different modulation schemes, on acoustic communication performance.  This research advances the knowledge and understanding of underwater acoustics and networking by providing an accurate communication module for simulation.  New applications such as energy harvesting using wave motion and microbial fuel cells, lifetime assessment of water based civil structures and harbor and port surveillance will become more feasible, impacting and increasing our nation?s energy and infrastructure capabilities.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the collaborative research will be disseminated through scholarly conferences and integrated into an open source simulation tool that will be made freely available to other researchers.  This work will allow other researchers to validate new networking algorithms and physical layer improvements in underwater acoustics and networking, which lags behind terrestrial communication research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "As field experiments for underwater communication and networking are expensive, many researchers are not able to perform such experiments.  For these reasons, researchers use simulation tools to test and validate new software algorithms and protocols.  These simulation tools often lack accurate communication models.  In this project, we studied the effects of the physical environment and communication settings on the performance of underwater communication.\nThe major outcome of this project is an underwater acoustic communication framework for use in a simulation tool.  This framework improves simulation accuracy which allows for better testing and verification of new software algorithms.  This framework is in the form of mathematical models which were implemented into a piece of software.  This software is included in an open-source, publicly available, simulation tool.  This framework was tested and validated using experimental results gathered in the South China Sea.  Finally, this framework will be widely used by domestic and international researchers for continual development of software algorithms and protocols for underwater communication and networking research.\nThe studies performed showed how acoustic signals perform in the presence of varying environmental factors such as different seafloor sediment types (sand, rock, etc.), varying wind and noise conditions and communication device settings.  These factors were included in the developed framework to allow researchers to select the appropriate conditions of the environment.  For example, to set the sediment type to sand, the wind to a light breeze and the noise level to minimal.  These parameters allow the framework to produce more accurate results as the performance of acoustic communication is environment dependent.\nIn addition to the technical outcomes of the project, project investigators were able to obtain first-hand international research experience and an introduction to the science infrastructure and policy of the foreign host.  This has resulted in making the project investigators more globally aware of science and education policies.\nThis project has resulted in two published conference papers and is expected to produce one more journal publication.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Zuba"
