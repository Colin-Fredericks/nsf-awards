 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to further develop the Animal Diversity Web (ADW), which is a highly structured database of biological information about organisms, accumulated through the efforts of students in university classes across the country. Its structure allows researchers to build tools and services to support active inquiry and other educational resources. The structure of the database, its rich content, and its versatility in working in combination with other data sources has enabled the ADW team to provide high quality data in accessible formats.\r\n\r\nThe ADW has demonstrated success in teaching students how to think like scientists at both K-12 and undergraduate levels for over 15 years. As a result, the research team has a broad set of resources that are widely used. The ADW is one of the largest and most widely used biological databases worldwide, with over 2 million pages served to over 300,000 users monthly, as well as connections to a large network of K-12 and undergraduate educators involved in ADW projects. This large user base represents a tremendous asset as the research team explores further development of ADW products. Further development of the ADW has the potential to expand both science-education as well as public understanding of science.",
