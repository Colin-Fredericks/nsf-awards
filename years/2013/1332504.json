 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile platforms have become extremely popular among users and an important platform for developers. New privacy and security issues arise with the prevalence of mobile computing since mobile devices often store tremendous amount of personal, financial and commercial data, and therefore attract both targeted and mass-scale attacks. To meet the growing demand for mobile computing and security professionals, it is vitally important to provide education in mobile computing and security to students in computer science and other related disciplines. The overall goal of the project at North Carolina A&T University is to address this workforce need by developing course modules in mobile computing and security. The modules will be integrated into existing Computer Science courses such as computer programming, software development, operating systems, and information assurance courses. Each course module includes a tutorial, presentation slides, hands-on labs and/or case studies, and test questions. To actively disseminate these new course materials, two faculty summer development workshops will be offered, as well as a mobile programming contest for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to strengthen the Computer Science program at North Carolina A&T University by updating the Computer Science curriculum to address state-of-art technology. Students will be more competitive in the workforce and well-prepared for graduate studies in the areas of mobile computing and security. Therefore, this project will increase the education and career opportunities of African American students. This project will also develop and strengthen the University's Center for Cyber Defense, a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, by expanding its education and research programs. Societal benefits of this project include increased educational materials and improved opportunities for training students to address mobile computing and security challenges.",
