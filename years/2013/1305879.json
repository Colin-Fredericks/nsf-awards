 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nThe fate of quantum coherence and the mechanisms of dissipation at the nanoscale are of fundamental scientific interest and have potential relevance to nanoelectronic technologies.  This project will use radio frequency noise measurements and sensitive electronic transport techniques to examine atomic and molecular-scale junctions driven out of equilibrium.  The scaling of nonequilibrium noise with bias and device temperature allows determination of the effective temperature of the driven electrons.  In junctions containing unpaired localized spins, noise measurements will probe Kondo physics, a consequence of quantum entanglement between the local spin and those of the conduction electrons.  Measurements of the bias and temperature dependence of conductance fluctuations will allow the estimation of the quantum coherence time for electrons in these nanostructures even near room temperature.  These experiments will provide outstanding research training in advanced fabrication and measurement skills (relevant for high technology industry) for two PhD students.  Results will be disseminated to the general public and K12 students through blogging and interactions with local museums.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nFamiliar to anyone who has ever used a toaster, when electric current flows through a macroscopic wire, energy carried by the moving electrons ends up in the form of heat, and the counterintuitive physics of quantum mechanics does not seem relevant.  However, when the current passes through a single atom or molecule, the way that heat gets generated and the role of quantum effects (that govern chemistry and physics at such scales) are much less transparent.  In this project two doctoral students will make atomic-scale junctions and use sensitive measurements of the current and its fluctuations as a function of time and voltage to \"take the temperature\" of the electrons, and to see the consequences of quantum mechanics on electrical conduction.  Understanding heating and quantum effects at these scales is relevant to the development of next-generation nanoelectronics technologies.  Students educated and trained in this area will be well positioned for jobs in high tech industry or research, and the PI will disseminate results to the general public and K12 students through blogging and interactions with local museums.",

&nbsp;&ldquo;Shot noise&rdquo; comprises the intrinsic fluctuations in the electrical current through some system caused by the fact that electrical charge comes in discrete amounts (the charges of single electrons), and that the arrivals of those electrons are usually distributed statistically rather than being perfectly regular in time.&nbsp; Measurements of shot noise are a way of accessing that statistical information, and therefore can serve as a very local probe of the way energy is distributed among the electrons, of particular interest if one is concerned with heating and dissipation at the nanoscale. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fig. 1) The primary technical outcomes (<em><strong>intellectual merit</strong></em>) of this work are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The PI&rsquo;s group refined a radio-frequency method of measuring shot noise that allowed the simultaneous measurement of noise and electrical conductance as atomic-scale junctions were repeatedly broken between Au wires.&nbsp;&nbsp; This way, the noise properties could be studied either in detail in individual atomic-scale junctions, or across the whole ensemble of possible atomic arrangements.</li>\n<li>Noise in individual junctions showed signs of rate increases or decreases at particular voltage thresholds.&nbsp; These are direct evidence that inelastic processes such as the interaction of energetic electrons with vibrations of the atomic lattice can modify the noise, even when there are a large number of quantum paths an electron can take across the junction, and noise in individual junctions can also show striking asymmetry with the direction of the electrical current, even when the current itself is not obviously asymmetric as a function of voltage.&nbsp; This indicates, consistent with some theoretical ideas, that inelastic processes, likely connected to current-driven motion of atoms, can depend strongly on the direction of current flow.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>In individual junctions, via the noise it is possible to look in detail at &ldquo;conductance fluctuations&rdquo; as a function of the bias applied across the junction.&nbsp; These fluctuations come from quantum interference between different electronic paths through the junction, and noise shows that they are consistent as expected with voltage-driven fluctuations in quantum transmission probabilities.&nbsp; (Fig. 2)</li>\n<li>Noise in ensembles of junctions increased more rapidly than expected with increasing voltage across the junction.&nbsp; Experiments showed that this effect is present both at room temperature and at cryogenic (77 K) temperatures.&nbsp; While it is possible mathematically to model this increase as a voltage-driven change in the distribution of (average) quantum transmission probabilities, the scaling with voltage is consistent with a driven heating process, where current drives atomic vibrations out of equilibrium, and those atomic vibrations then alter the current noise.&nbsp;
