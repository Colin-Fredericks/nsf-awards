 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael B. Hall at Texas A&M University, College Station, will solve problems of current interest in catalytic reactions or in fundamental steps of catalytic cycles involving the activation of alkanes and dihydrogen by using modern quantum mechanical calculations. Full-gradient geometry optimizations with non-local density-functional theory and ab initio energy calculations, primarily coupled cluster and multireference configuration interaction, will be the primary computational tools.  The research will study both natural enzymatic systems, particularly the hydrogenase enzymes, and totally synthetic systems, including model complexes for the hydrogenase systems and both thermal and photochemical activation of the systems that activate alkanes and dihydrogen. The project will involve close collaborations with experimental groups. These frontier problems also provide a testing ground for new functional and methodological developments.  In that regard two developments are planned: one on the generalized molecular orbital method, which is a restricted-active-space self-consistent-field method to initialize multireference configuration interaction, and another on the \"Fenske-Hall\" approximate molecular orbital method.  The Fenske-Hall method will be expanded to explore its applicability to combined quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical calculations.  Its development will be particularly useful in modeling metalloenzymes and in metallo-clusters possibly as large as small nanocrystals.  The close coupling of theory and experiment through collaborative arrangements will stimulate rapid progress on these important chemical problems.\r\n\r\nAlkane activation can play a role in making better use of these basic raw materials, and understanding how nature and artificial systems cleave and reassemble hydrogen can help in the development of a hydrogen economy.  In addition to the education of students and postdoctoral associates at Texas A&M University, the large number of collaborators now associated with the laboratory brings the educational aspects to a much broader audience. In addition to the intellectual value in the development of the Fenske-Hall method, its simple graphical users interface (GUI) will be expanded to allow the method to be easily used by a wider audience and to be incorporated into teaching both undergraduate and graduate students about chemical bonding concepts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTheoretical Studies of Inorganic, Organometallic, and Bioinorganic Systems\n\nThrough this award funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael B. Hall at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, studied problems of current interest in catalytic reactions or fundamental steps in catalytic cycles involving the activation of alkanes and dihydrogen by using modern quantum mechanical calculations. The research involved both natural enzymatic systems, particularly the hydrogenase enzymes, and totally synthetic systems, including model complexes for the hydrogenase systems and both thermal and photochemical activation of the systems that activate with experimental collaborations. Alkane activation can play a role in making better use of these raw materials and understanding how nature and artificial systems cleave and reassemble hydrogen can help in the development of a hydrogen economy. \n\nThis project resulted in seventeen publications in major international scientific journals reporting numerous new discoveries.  Among these discoveries were several, in which the ligands attached to the transitional metal played a much larger role in the catalytic reaction than would normally be expected.  A particularly important discovery showed how the ligands work to facilitate the transformation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methanol and water.  This particular transformation may play a key role in our energy future; when electricity from solar becomes excessive during the day, we need a way to store the energy for later use.  Using this excess electricity to generate hydrogen then combining it with carbon dioxide to make methanol, an easily storable liquid fuel, may make an important contribution.\n\nThe enzymes known as Hydrogenases are able to convert protons and electron into hydrogen at very fast rates and with little wasted energy (overpotential).  Eight publications are devoted to problems related to this enzyme and to model compounds that mimic the behavior of this enzyme.  Modeling and predicting how this enzyme works in detail may lead us to be able to create new material that would be suitable as inexpensive electron material for hydrogen production and in hydrogen fuel cells.  One particular paper was chosen for the cover of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. \n\nIn addition to the education of students and postdoctoral associates at Texas A&amp;M University, the large number of collaborators now associated with the laboratory brings the educational aspects to a much broader audience. In addition to the intellectual value in the further development of the Fenske-Hall method, its simple graphical users interface (GUI) allows the method to be easily used by a wider audience and to be incorporated into teaching both undergraduate and graduate students about chemical bonding concepts.  The teaching value of this Fenske-Hall/GUI is extremely high as it is the only simple technique available that combines all elements capability (including transition metals) and fragment analysis and construction, which clarifies the bonding in large systems by simplifying their construction from simple metal-ligand fragments. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael B Hall"
