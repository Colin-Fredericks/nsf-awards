 "awd_abstract_narration": "The latitudinal gradient in species diversity is one of the most striking biogeographic patterns in nature, with species richness peaking in equatorial regions for nearly all groups. Despite considerable effort to understand the origin and maintenance of latitudinal gradients in species diversity, a multitude of potentially interacting, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses exist, and no single over-riding explanation has emerged. However, multiple hypotheses link the latitudinal diversity gradient to a presumed gradient in the strength of biotic interactions between temperate and tropical environments. While biotic interactions are believed to play a major role in the origin and maintenance of diversity and may drive increased rates of adaptation and speciation in tropical regions, this hypothesis remains virtually untested. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptive phenotypic variation in color, vision, and smell across a rapidly diversifying lineage of butterflies will be performed together with field-studies. \r\n\t\r\nUnderstanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity is a central goal of biology, and an increasingly important facet of the endangered species management, particularly in a time of rapid global climate change. This proposal links biodiversity researchers across the US and Latin America, and will lead to sustained international collaboration; broadened access to STEM fields for women and minorities through targeted recruitment; substantial employment opportunities across institutions and countries; and an enhanced public understanding of biodiversity science and threats to global biodiversity.",

Stronger interactions favor the evolution of new species as well as specialization on limited resources that allows more species to coexist. We set out to test this hypothesis by studying the fine-scale use of forest habitats, seasonal variation, biology, distribution and evolutionary relationships of <em>Adelpha </em>(also known as Sisters), a diverse group of fast-flying, colorful butterflies. We sampled three butterfly communities in Ecuador, one of the world's three most diverse countries for butterflies, every month over multiple years. We also conducted field experiments to study predation on warning color patterns displayed by different species of <em>Adelpha</em>. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of <em>Adelpha </em>showed that some lineages evolved much faster than others, and that shifts to new hostplants were likely important in diversification. Furthermore, repeated evolution of remarkably similar, bright upperside wing patterns is consistent with mimicry, the convergence of warning patterns driven by predator selection. The basis for mimicry in <em>Adelpha </em>is still under study, but one possibility is that some <em>Adelpha</em> are toxic as a result of their caterpillars feeding on a particular hostplant family, while other species that lack chemical defenses mimic the toxic model species and thereby deceive predators. Field tests of bird attacks on <em>Adelpha </em>models in Ecuador showed that a putative mimic was able to avoid predation, likely as a result of occurring at sufficiently low abundance in comparison to its model; an earlier study in Costa Rica, where the mimic was much more abundant, showed that it was also attacked at higher rates.</p>\n<p>This project involved multiple researchers, undergraduate students and institutional staff from the USA, Ecuador and other countries. Postdoctoral researchers and students received hands-on training in conducting research and compiling and analyzing data, both in the field and in the lab, and some have advanced to positions in institutions and graduate school, within and outside Ecuador. Several museum collections of <em>Adelpha </em>were enhanced by addition of new material and revision of existing specimens, both within Ecuador and the USA, improving our knowledge of <em>Adelpha </em>diversity and distribution. For example, during curation we discovered the first known specimens of an enigmatic, distinctive Brazilian <em>Adelpha</em> species, previously known only from a hand-colored painting from its original description in 1907. This discovery validated the existence of the species, extended its known range by about 700 miles, and improved our understanding of <em>Adelpha</em> evolution. The project also initiated a long-term butterfly monitoring program in Ecuador by providing training courses for national park rangers, who now conduct regular monitoring events in one of Ecuador's largest and most biologically diverse national parks. The success of this program has resulted in calls for its expansion to other sites, and we hope that it will provide the basis for a national monitoring network in Ecuador that will ultimately enable large scale studies of butterfly population trends.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/28/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Keith&nbsp;R&nbsp;Willmott</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342705/1342705_10277343_1553778852212_outcome_img_butterflies--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342705/1342705_10277343_1553778852212_outcome_img_butterflies--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Adelpha butterflies (Sisters)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1342705/1342705_10277343_1553778852212_outcome_img_butterflies--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Adelpha butterflies (Sisters)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Predator selection for mimetic wing patterns in Adelpha causes strong divergence in some closely related species (A. lycorias, A. phylaca) that live in different habitats, and convergence in other distantly related species (A. iphiclus, A. serpa) that fly together in the same forest.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">K.
