 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identifying the basic habitat requirements of Antarctic predators is fundamental to understanding how they will respond to the human-induced challenges of commercial fisheries and climate change. This understanding can only be achieved if the underlying linkages to physical processes are related to animal movements. As part of the international Retrospective Analysis of Antarctic Tracking Data (RAATD) organized by the SCAR Expert Group of Birds and Marine Mammals, this research will collate and synthesize tracking data from crabeater seals, Lobodon carcinophagus, and Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddelli. These data will be combined with all available data from the Southern Ocean that has been collected by researchers from Norway, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and the USA. These data will be analyzed using a common analytical approach and synthesized into a synoptic view of these two species across the Southern Ocean. The diving and movement patterns will be examined for each species. As well, the total home range and core habitat utilization patterns for each species and region will be determined. This study will develop global habitat maps for each species based on physical and biological attributes of their \"hot-spots\" and then overlay all the species specific maps to identify multi-species areas of ecological significance. Broader impacts include support and training for a postdoctoral scholar, the production of a publicly available database and the participation in an international data synthesis effort.",

The Retrospective Analysis of Antarctic Tracking Data (RAATD) aims to undertake a predator community-wide assessment of habitat use of predatory species in the entire Southern Ocean. As part of this initiative, our lab was in charge of gathering and analyzing all data available for crabeater (<em>Lobodon carcinophaga</em>) and Weddell seals (<em>Leptonychotes weddelli</em>), two species of ice seals that inhabit the coast of the entire Antarctic continent. These two species were selected in consideration of (1) their large abundance in Antarctic waters (population sizes estimated in several hundreds of thousands individuals to tens of millions), (2) their importance as predators of the pack ice and fast ice regions in the Southern Ocean, preying upon Antarctic krill (<em>Euphasia superba</em>), Antarctic silverfish (<em>Pleurogramma antarcticum</em>) and Antarctic toothfish (<em>Dissostichus mawsonni</em>), among other prey, and (3) the availability of large datasets of tracking data available for bot species, spanning for over 30 years.

ARGOS satellite tracks were collected between the early 90s until 2013 by investigators from Australia, France, Germany, Norway, United Kingdom and United States. Crabeater seal deployments (n = 102) were rather short in duration (with the exception of animals tagged in the Ross Sea), and across their distribution individuals displayed similar patterns of movement, that correspond to the local conditions associated with the ice edge. The tracking data for Weddell seals were not only more numerous in terms of number of individuals tagged (n = 135), but came from a greater number of research programs. As a result, there are more locations across the Antarctic continent for which Weddell seal tracking data are available. Weddell seal deployments also lasted longer, with a maximum duration of just under 1 year. Weddell seal tracking data revealed a large variability across the range of the species. For instance, animals tagged at Dumont d&rsquo;Urville station (Ad&egrave;lie land) reached a maximum distance of only 57 km from the tagging locations, whereas Weddell seals tagged in the Weddell Sea reached over 390 km from the capture site. Crabeater seals&rsquo; average weekly home range was 4441 &plusmn; 23834 km<sup>2</sup>, and these weekly home ranges varied among the different areas of the Southern Ocean. &nbsp;Animals tagged in the western Antarctica Peninsula had a much more restricted distribution compared with animals from other locations.
