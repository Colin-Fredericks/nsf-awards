 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds improvements to Eastern Kentucky University's field station including construction of a 2200 square foot research center.  The new centers permits those who use the field station, both from EKU as well as visiting scientists and students, to broaden the scope of research onsite and in the region as well as strengthen research training, research-informed teaching, and outreach capabilities.\r\n\r\nEKU's field station at Lilley Cornett Woods (www.naturalareas.eku.edu/lilley-cornett-woods-appalachian-ecological-research-station) has supported place-based scientific research, environmental monitoring, research-informed training, interdisciplinary collegiate education, K-16 environmental education, and community outreach for over four decades. The site is composed primarily of old-growth forest. Consequently, it is a reserve of biological diversity, is a valuable resource for research and training, and provides a unique opportunity for outreach and education within an ecologically distinct Appalachian landscape partially degraded by coal mining and other land uses. \r\n\r\nThe longterm data collected at Lilley Cornett Woods is used for longitudinal investigations regarding the integrated themes of environmental, ecological, geological, and climatological change. Appalachian Kentucky is a recognized \"hotspot\" of biological diversity. EKU's tradition of organismal studies is ideal for investigating ecosystem structure and change, as modified by anthropogenic pressures. Ongoing investigations (e.g., diversity studies, biogeochemical characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic systems, invasive species, carbon sequestration and cycling) are being expanded and diversified across the spectrum of disturbed, modified, and old-growth ecosystems through new collaborations made possible by the new facility. EKU is currently working with external scientists through the NSF-funded Virtual Observatory and Ecological Information Systems, and increased networking capacity permits broader research collaborations outside the region. \r\n\r\nEKU's long tradition of education provides a foundation in serving a spectrum of educational needs. Undergraduate and graduate science classes at EKU currently have strong experiential and field components. Student research by both undergraduate and graduate students, mentored by faculty investigators, underpins field research at the University as evidenced by the NSF REU site at Lilley Cornett Woods. The new facility enhances outreach in K-12 education, especially in fostering science literacy. The use of effective teaching strategies such as field- and project-based experiences can open pathways into scientific careers for many students.",

Specifically, we constructed a research building (1709 sq ft) and purchased equipment. Also, we used these funds to leverage support from Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) to construct housing and kitchen facilities (753 sq ft), to purchase additional equipment and supplies, and to improve the drive and drainage around the buildings, which provides increased parking and school bus access. These facilities will elevate the research capacity of LCW and help establish sustained, high-level research through long-term internal and external scientific studies. It will provide the opportunity for EKU to strengthen its research training, research-informed teaching, and outreach capabilities. The facilities allow for expansion of current techniques to include new avenues of research and will serve as a central hub providing opportunity to reach full potential for regional research in Appalachia. Thus, this FSML project will enhance research and training by a broad and diverse group of scientists and students from within EKU and beyond.</p>\n<p>Prior to this project, the field station supported outreach in K&ndash;12 education, especially in fostering science literacy, but at a moderate level relative to its potential. STEM education is a weakness in the educational tapestry of Kentucky. Therefore, the use of effective teaching strategies such as field- and project-based experiences can potentially open pathways into interest in scientific careers. Additionally, the site is embedded in a landscape of mixed land uses and natural habitats in the heart of southern Appalachia&rsquo;s coal country, which is one of the most persistently socioeconomically impoverished regions in the nation. Facilities provided by this project will enhance our outreach to public schools, citizen groups, and surrounding communities, and bolster opportunities for citizen science.</p>\n<p>During the first year of operation, use of the field station for research, education, and outreach by EKU and external entities increased dramatically. We had 26 groups totaling 679 people, including K&ndash;12 students and teachers, university students and faculty, and citizens (with some overlap of attendees). This roughly breaks down as six researchers, six university classes (72 people), seven K&ndash;12 classes (428 people), two teacher training workshops (17 people), an annual overnight field camp for faculty-student collaborative discussions of teaching and research (55 people), an informational meeting for our upcoming Research Experience for Undergraduates based at LCW (21 regional college students and two faculty from six schools), an art camp (22 people), and two workshops of 30 citizens being trained and conducting citizen science.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
