 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this funding, the Principal Investigator (PI) will study oscillations in the global record and their effect on the deduced anthropogenic warming trend. In particular, the relationship between global variability at a 70-year scale and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation will be examined. The deduction of the anthropogenic trend in data is often complicated by the presence of this large amplitude low-frequency variability, since its trough-to-peak excursion is one half of the observed warming trend for the past 150 years. When it is added to the underlying anthropogenic warming trend, it creates the accelerated warming seen since 1978 and the cooling experienced in the 1970s. The early twentieth century warming was probably largely caused by the previous positive phase of this oscillation. The global oscillation appears to have its origin in the sea surface temperature variability of the North Atlantic, as a manifestation of a high frequency variability of the thermohaline circulation, but the mechanisms involved are not yet well established. \r\n\r\nCurrent data analysis methods may not be adequate for studying such low-frequency variability given the limited time span of the observation. New methods are for analyzing the global data record, to provide a quantification of errors due to the fact that even the longest quasi-global climate records (1850-present) are not long enough. On the other hand, a longer instrumental record at Central England (1659-present) and several even longer ice-core data records from Greenland will be studied to establish the existence of this oscillation in the pre-industrial era. The global temperature and sea-level pressure will be studied in more detail to understand the propagation of the signal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Correlation studies will be performed with the Arctic ice-melt to determine if the latter is involved as a negative feedback necessary to establish an oscillation.\r\n\r\nThe project will establish the significance of multidecadal natural variability in the North Atlantic and thus improve the detection and attribution of climate change. This is an important problem in climate science that has substantial broader impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe observed global-mean surface temperature has been warming in the presence of increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, but its rise has not been monotonic.  There were periods, such as the late and early 20th century, when global warming was rapid, and in between and during the early 21st century, periods when the warming slowed.  This low-frequency variability about the rising trend has led to confusion concerning the interpretation of anthropogenic response to greenhouse gases.  \n\nThe major goals of the project are:\n\n(1) To analyze the low-frequency variability of surface temperature in instrumental and proxy data.\n\n(2) To understand the contribution of the internal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans to the global-mean surface temperature variation in the decadal and interdecadal time scales.\n\n(3) To understand the physical mechanisms responsible for generating decadal and multidecadal oscillations in the sea-surface temperature data.\n\nAccomplishments:\n\nThe proposed goals have been accomplished.  The results are described in journal publications.\n\nThe variations are caused by unforced, internal variability of our climate system.
