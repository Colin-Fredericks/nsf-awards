  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on algorithms for working with 3D geometric data based on insights from the mathematical field of differential geometry.  One significant outcome was an algorithm for synthesizing stripe patterns on digital surfaces.  Stripe patterns are ubiquitous in nature, describing macroscopic phenomena such as stripes on plants and animals, down to material impurities on the atomic scale, and are connected to the phenomenon of edge dislocations or points where a crystal fails to form a perfect regular lattice.  The algorithm allows stripe patterns to be quickly computed on any shape, allowing efficient exploration and design of such patterns.  An important feature of this formulation is that it is convex, meaning that one can quickly and reliably find optimal solutions.  Another major outcome was a computational framework for designing and manufacturing three-dimensional shapes from auxetic materials, i.e., materials that stretch or shrink uniformly.  Such materials are attractive because they can be cut out of flat sheets (like sheet metal or plywood) which are easy to manufacture and transport.  These sheets can later be assembled to form intricate, dynamically evolving shapes.  Our work identified important connections between auxetic materials and conformal geometry, allowing us to leverage well-developed mathematical and computational tools.  This perspective helps broaden the scope of recent work on deployable structures based on origami, which represents isometric or length-preserving motions.  It work also opens up new theoretical questions about how conformal or angle-preserving motions might be exactly represented on computers; a central question in a mathematical area called discrete complex analysis.  Other outcomes included new methods for recovering the shape of a surface from a list of point-to-point distances, and a new approach to computing the distance between two nodes on a network by leveraging ideas about heat flow, i.e., the way heat diffuses through an environment over time.
