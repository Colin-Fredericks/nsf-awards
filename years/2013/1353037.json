 "awd_abstract_narration": "President Obama announced in April 2013 that the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) would launch a STEM AmeriCorps initiative to build student interest in STEM.  A RFA is currently being prepared to be released in the late fall of 2013.  This project will engage in quick response research to identify an evaluation and research agenda that can begin to inform the program launch. Thus, the timeframe for informing the initial stages of STEM AmeriCorps is relatively short, and the creation of an evaluation and research agenda is very timely.\r\n\r\nThe products from the RAPID proposal are: (1) a review of the evaluation and research literature on the use of volunteers and/or mentors to build students' interest in STEM; (2) to convene a workshop to identify evaluation and research priorities to guide the initiative; and (3) a summary evaluation agenda that identifies promising directions along with the strength of evidence around key issues.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhat were the major goals of the project?\n\n\nEncouraging student interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) is an urgent priority in the US and abroad.  How most effectively to generate and sustain student interest in and preparation for STEM education and careers remains a vexing question, as the content areas, target ages, instructional approaches, and specific purposes of STEM education&mdash;and career preparation&mdash;are so diverse. Political interest in uncovering means to prepare and engage both larger numbers and more diverse students in STEM fields has extended to the practice of engaging STEM professionals in educational activities with students.  What is the empirical evidence\nabout which approaches that rely upon STEM experts to engage students work and for whom? The purpose of this grant was to summarize research about the effects of such programs on student outcomes.  It also developed recommendations for strengthening the research basis about using\nSTEM professionals in the future.\n\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals?\n\n\nThe study conducted a literature review, identified articles that met screening criteria, and ultimately selected 29 articles (from several hundred initially identified) that met the final criteria (e.g., described (1) programs that engaged K&ndash;12 students in STEM activities, in and/or outside of school, and in which adults or older students served to help increase student engagement, interest, persistence and achievement; and (2) program-specific activities\nor practices, rather than generic activities. Those papers were further\nreviewed and summarized in a working white paper, discussions with a panel of experts in STEM student engagement, and disseminated via conferences,\nweb-posting, and preparation of a journal article.\n\n\nWhat opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?\n\nThe project provided professional development for junior research staff about conducting rigorous research syntheses.\n\n \nHow have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?\n\nThe study results have been disseminated to members of the expert panel, to the CAISE Informal Science resource library (see http://informalscience.org/research/ic-000-000-010-292/Defining_a_research_agenda_for_STEM_Corps),\npresented at the March 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society for Research on\nEducational Effectiveness, at the April Annual Meeting of the American\nEducational Research Association, and summarized in a journal article (revised and resubmitted) to the International Journal of Science Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beth Gamse"
