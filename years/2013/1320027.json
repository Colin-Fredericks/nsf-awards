 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energy efficiency of high-end computers has reached a plateau for some time now, yielding devices that are constrained by power and thermal limits and do not realize the full performance potential of advanced semiconductors.  This research project will explore computing architectures that rely on energy recycling to operate with significantly improved energy efficiency and are thus capable of achieving sustained clock speeds well in excess of 10GHz without any special cooling requirements.  The resulting technologies will be assessed through the design and evaluation of silicon prototype chips.  The outcomes of this research project can be transformative, demonstrating integrated computing systems that achieve unprecedented performance levels.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the realization of next-generation high-performance computers, promoting discovery, teaching, and learning in novel design technologies that yield energy-efficient electronics.  Broader outcomes of the proposed effort include the integration of research activities into graduate-level courses, the development of lectures and projects for advanced undergraduate-level courses, the direct involvement of electrical engineering and computer science majors through senior-level design projects, and the engagement of high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExcessive power consumption is the main factor limiting performance in today?s high-end computing devices.  This project explores hardware design technologies for power-efficient computer chips, thus paving the way for a new generation of computers that operate several times faster and more efficiently than state-of-the-art designs.  Our investigation focuses on energy recycling chips that recover and reuse energy during operation.  Although a simple concept in principle, recycling energy in computer chips represents a significant departure from established design practices.  Early work in this area has led to large and impractical designs, and so far the power-saving potential of this technology has remained largely untapped.\n\nThe main outcome of this project is the successful prototyping and demonstration of practical technologies for high-speed energy-recycling chips.  Among other silicon prototype chips, this project has demonstrated a GHz-speed energy-recycling chip for advanced communication applications that consumes less than half as much power as its conventional counterparts at the same performance level.  Unlike previous energy-recycling chips that rely on large on-chip components to recycle power, this prototype uses off-chip components embedded into its package, incurring no silicon area overheads in comparison with its conventional counterparts.\n\nFrom an intellectual merit standpoint, this work demonstrates the potential of a yet untapped design methodology to yield computer chips with significantly improved speed and power efficiency over the state of the art.  From a broader impact standpoint, this work is expected to eventually lead to faster processors for high-performance servers in the cloud or more capable processors for mobile applications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marios C Papaefthymiou"
