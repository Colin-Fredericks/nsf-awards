 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methylmercury (MeHg) causes a variety of adverse health effects in exposed humans and wildlife but its formation and cycling in oceanic waters have not been fully characterized or quantified.  This research program seeks to better understand factors controlling the production, fate, phytoplankton uptake, and transfer of MeHg in the marine environment\r\n\r\nA combination of laboratory, field studies and modeling efforts will investigate the bioaccumulation, trophic transfer in aquatic food webs, and implications that this may have on the global transport of this potent neurotoxin. Laboratory and coastal field studies of MeHg interactions with different types of phytoplankton, interaction with specific organic compounds, effects of light and temperature are all expected to influence MeHg binding and or uptake into phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include: \r\n1) provision of  policy relevant information in support of monitoring and evaluation efforts for control of anthropogenic mercury releases; \r\n2) informing education on marine conservation and sustainability by developing a case study on mercury in the marine environment; and \r\n3) training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists",

This work has more broadly contributed to a 3-D biogeochemical modeling capability for persistent global contaminants that is available to the global community of GEOS-Chem and MITgcm users.  This research was also used to inform the negotiations of the global Minamata Convention for controlling anthropogenic mercury released led by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2013 and subsequent activities leading toward ratification.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elsie M Sunderland"
