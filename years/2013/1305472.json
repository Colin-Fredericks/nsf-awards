 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focusses on two groups of topics in mathematical physics: the spectral theory of random operators, and statistical mechanics models, with special focus on two and quasi-one-dimensional systems. A wide range of methods from mathematical physics, classical analysis, probability theory, and convex geometry will be applied to study some of the open problems in these areas. In addition, the connections between the two areas will be investigated. Several major problems pertaining to random band operators remain open after many years of research. Perturbative series (such as resolvent expansions) typically diverge in the physically interesting regimes, whereas the non-perturbative methods (supersymmetric formalism, transfer operators) have been only partially developed. The PI will develop perturbative and non-perturbative methods to improve the rigorous understanding of the spectral properties of random band operators. In two- and higher dimensional statistical mechanics, the PI will investigate the large scale properties of gradient models, as well as discrete models. A better understanding of the former will also shed light on the latter (for example, on two-dimensional height models). The PI will strive to combine the well-developed multi-scale and convexity methods with techniques from analysis and high-dimensional convex geometry. \r\nBroader impacts \r\nThis project will develop the connections between mathematical physics and other fields of mathematics, especially, probability theory, classical analysis and convex geometry. These connections may lead to developments in all these fields. The PI has delivered numerous talks at seminars, colloquia, and international conferences in mathematical physics, analysis, probability, high-dimensional geometry, and the interactions between these areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch Goals\n\nThe goal of the project was to develop mathematical methods and results for problems which arise in the study of physics models in two areas:  1) random operators, 2) critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. \n\nSignificant findings (in works carried our in different collaborations) include: \n\n1. Random operators:   Here the goal was to develop mathematical analysis of disorder effects on the spectra and dynamics of quantum operators, the like of which guide the theory of condensed matter physics.  Of particular interest have been methods for proving existence of, and analysing,  conducting states in the presence of disorder.  Opposite of the that is the phenomenon of localization.  \n\nNew results on localization were derived in the first phase of the project by S. Sodin and collaborators.   In the direction of delocalization  the PI's work with S. Warzel on Resonant Delocalization, has broken new grounds.  It provides a tool for existence proofs of absolutely continuous spectrum in the presence of disorder.  The corresponding extended eigenfunctions play a role in models of quantum conduction.  The analysis has also implications also for elementary quantum computional algorithm which relate to random operators on expander graphs.   \n\nThe two authors (MA and SW)   have completed a graduate textbook on Random Operators.   It provides a self contained presentation of some of the key mathematical methods and results for Random Operators, including some new results.  Its subject is an active research area, in which probability combines with analysis, addressing questions of quantum physics. \n\n2. Statistical Mechanics:     The broader goal has been to understand the critical phenomena in low dimensions, i.e. below the upper critical dimension beyond which the critical behavior simplifies (d=4, for the models studied here).    \n\nThe non-trivial solvable models of statistical mechanice are found essentially only in two dimensions, and limited there to a restricted class of planar models.   The plan has been to rethink the phenomena found there in terms which are robust and may extend beyond the solvable cases.   Of particular interest has been the emergence of quantum-like  structures, expressed in Pfaffian relations, in the correlation functions of classical models such as the Ising spin system and the classical dimer cover problem.    \n\nIn the new work, the  Pfaffian structure of certain correlation functions in the dimer-covering planar graph models was rederived through a combinatorial / topological argument, which is of use also beyond the solvable cases. This was done using an extension of stochastic geometric representation which the PI has previously employed for the study of  critical phenomena in Ising and related models in high dimensions.  \n\nSimilar Pfaffian relations have been previously noted in the integrable Ising model.  The new approach sheds light on the asymptotic validity of the Pfaffian relations beyond the solvable cases to which most prior results were limited.

Their, and other  collaborators's participation in the project has been invaluable for its success.  \nPublication and dissemination \nResults of the research were published in refereed journals, and presented, by PI and/or research collaborators, in seminars and workshops in domestic and international conferences. \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Aizenman"
