 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues an interdisciplinary program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from ultradense nuclear matter in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in neutron stars to ultracold atomic and condensed matter systems. Nuclear theory will be applied to study the properties of matter formed under extreme conditions of temperatures and pressures, to matter in neutron stars, with the aim of understanding observations and experiment and, conversely, using observations of neutron stars to learn properties of matter under extreme conditions. This research makes important interdisciplinary connections between nuclear and QCD problems and cold atom systems and will apply expertise in quantum fluids to predict the behavior of dilute helium solutions used in the proposed experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source to detect the electric dipole moment of the neutron.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding new states of matter and connections between them provides broad intellectual insights into the basic properties of matter ranging from the hottest to the coldest many-particle systems in the universe. By integrating students and post-doctoral fellows into a diverse program that crosses the traditional boundaries between nuclear, particle, condensed matter and atomic physics, the PI and his colleagues provide unique opportunities for young researchers to think and create across disciplines. The scientists trained in this program have generally gone on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad.",

Research on this Grant has been aimed at expanding our knowledge of unusual states of matter under extreme conditions of density, energy, and temperature. \n\nIn recent years physicists have created several new forms of matter -- the densest hottest matter in the universe called a \"quark-gluon plasma,\" and the coldest matter in the universe, in the form of trapped atomic gases.  The former has been created since the turn of the present century at the Brookhaven Relativistic Collider (RHIC) in the U.S., and later at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. The latter has been explored in table-top experiments in laboratories originally in the U.S., and now at laboratories around the world.\nBy finding and exploiting connections between these areas, we deepen our understanding of nuclear-particle physics, atomic physics and condensed matter physics, and at the same time continue the building of new bridges between these areas.\n\nA major focus of our research is to explore what matter is like at the highest possible densities and temperatures.  Such matter filled the early universe prior to a microsecond after the big bang; it can be created in the laboratory in highly energetic collisions of large atomic nuclei, and is richly present, as we have found out in our research, in the cores of neutron stars -- stars weighing about as much as the sun, but only some 15 miles across, stars that are left behind when normal stars burn up all their nuclear fuel, first collapse and then generally explode. \n\nHere we have made detailed determinations and predictions of the phases that such quark matter can assume, including possible superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensed states in which the quarks act coherently in locked step, and also determined how such matter appears in neutron stars.  This research is becoming a key input into interpreting measurements from two experiments;  the NASA NICER experiment (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) on the International Space Station, which is now measuring neutron star masses and radii; and the LIGO experiment, which is searching for cosmic gravitational radiation produced by mergers of pairs of neutron stars, and neutron stars and black holes.   \n\nAn important component of the present research program is its interdisciplinary approach to problems of many-particle systems that crosses subfields, bringing to bear experience over the years in a wide spectrum of research in condensed matter, atomic, nuclear, and astrophysics.

The many students and postdocs trained over the years in our group generally have gone on to productive research careers at universities and national laboratories, in the U.S. and abroad.   We remain very committed to this core training function of our research program.\n\nBy examining deeply the properties of such extreme states of matter, particularly when we look at these states from an interdisciplinary perspective,\nwe develop the framework and tools to allow significant technological applications in the future.  Understanding how groups of particles, from quarks to atoms, behave and act in concert provides deeper insights into the laws governing the microscopic universe, the basic properties of the world we live in, and opens the possibilities of controlling the microscopic world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon A Baym"
