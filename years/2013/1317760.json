 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Timothy M. Dore at the University of Georgia who will explore the mechanism of photodeprotection and optimize the sensitivity of photoremovable protecting groups (PPG) that are sensitive to two-photon excitation (2PE). A host of spectroscopic techniques will be used to study quinoline and other PPG with sensitivity to 2PE. These materials have the potential to be used to photoregulate the action of biological effectors. Optimizing their photochemical properties for biological applications requires a good understanding of the photodeprotection reaction mechanism. The study will expand the base of photoprotecting groups available, as well as carry out photophysical and photochemical studies aimed at providing an improved understanding of the mechanism by which the systems operate. The research in this proposal will enable the development of novel tools and techniques to apply to fundamental scientific questions in neuroscience, developmental biology, biochemistry, physiology, and medicinal chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Timothy M. Dore will prepare appropriate chemical compounds and understand the photophysical characteristics that will make them useful in two-photon excitation for precise 3-D control of biological processes. In addition to the broader impact of the relationship of the work to the biological sciences, the inclusion of undergraduate researchers is a major strength of the proposal. The multidisciplinary nature of this research provides an excellent medium to integrate research and education and to train students to become outstanding scholars with a depth of understanding of organic chemistry and photochemistry. Undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, play a major role in the research. The PI has trained over 25 undergraduates and many are coauthors on articles and manuscripts and have matriculated into doctoral programs. The research plan includes the participation of underrepresented groups in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo understand fundamental biological processes at the cellular and sub-cellular level requires tools that can act as a switch to turn on or turn off physiological events, such as gene expression, neurotransmission, metabolism, and others.  Light is an excellent switch, because one can control when it is on or off and it can be directed to a particular location, even an extremely small one.  To use light as a switch, one can employ light-harvesting molecules that, when exposed to light, cause a chemical reaction to occur that releases a biologically active compound.  The combination of the light harvesting component and the biologically active compound is called a \"caged compound\" (Figure 1).  The biologically active compound might be a neurotransmitter or a hormone that activates the cellular process under study.  Alternatively, it could be a reagent that switches on or off the expression of a particular gene of interest.  High spatial selectivity of photochemical activation in thee dimensions is achieved through two-photon excitation (2PE) (Figure 2), where a laser is used to activate the caged compound only within the focal volume of the beam, which can be as small as a synapse on a neuron in the brain.\n\nPrior to this award, we invented a series of quinoline molecules that are reasonably good at harvesting light and releasing biologically active compounds (Figure 3), but the photochemical properties needed to be optimized for biological use.  Understanding the mechanism of how these quinoline-based light-harvesting molecules react with light and release the biologically active compound is critical to designing improvements, so in this project we used photochemical and spectroscopic techniques to determine the mechanism by which the quinolines absorb light and undergo the subsequent photochemical reaction.  The knowledge gained was then integrated into the design of improved light-harvesting molecules to be used in caged compounds.\n\nThe work conducted led to several discoveries about the photochemistry of quinoline-based caged compounds.  The reaction is heavily dependent on the solvent, the location and type of substituents around the quinoline structure, and the nature of the biologically active compound.  The light absorption and subsequent release of the biologically active compound is among the fastest known&mdash;the reaction is completed within 10 nanoseconds.  We developed a better understanding of a detrimental side reaction, which we could eliminate through some changes to the design of the light-harvesting molecules.  We also expanded the types of biologically active compounds that could be released with light using the quinoline-based light-harvesting molecules.\n\nThe work funded by this award has impacted the study of biology, especially developmental biology, which is the study of the processes by which plants and animals grow from a single cell to a complex multicellular organism.  It enabled us to work with collaborators to investigate the role of serotonin in left-right patterning in the developing embryo in a model organism.  It has led to the creation of photoactivatable reagents to knock down the expression of a gene called GAD1, which maintains the supply of the major neurotransmitter GABA in the brain.  This led to the discovery that GAD1 has a role in regulating the migration of cells early in development to form facial features in a model vertebrate in addition to a role in seizure disorders, such as epilepsy.  The work from this project has also enabled the creation of photoactivatable forms of important signaling molecules, including neurotransmitters, steroid hormones, and amino acids to enable the study of their role in physiology.\n\nThis project\u00c6s multidisciplinary nature provided a robust training environment for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the areas of chemical synthesis, photochemistry, time-resolved spectroscopy, and molecular design.
