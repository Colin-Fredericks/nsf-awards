 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal is to develop a set of algorithms to increase the energy\r\nefficiency of cellular wireless networks. These networks were\r\noriginally designed without paying sufficient attention to their\r\nefficiency, calculated to be less than 10%. With cellular traffic\r\nincreasing at exponential rates, the experts believe that in one\r\ndecade the traffic will be 1000 times today's traffic. In the proposed\r\nresearch, a number of algorithms will be developed to improve energy\r\nefficiency. Examples are new modulation techniques, new link adaptation\r\nalgorithms, or algorithms for the cellular network to adapt to\r\nchanging traffic conditions such that cells with small traffic use\r\nonly as much energy as needed, or cells shut down, their coverage to\r\nbe taken over by their neighboring base stations. We analyze the\r\ncontributions of a number of different techniques, and reach the\r\nconclusion that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption in the\r\ncellular network base stations to the 1.5-2% of its current levels.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is in redesigning the cellular\r\nnetwork and improving its energy efficiency by several orders of\r\nmagnitude. This will be achieved by a new set of tools, methods, and\r\nalgorithms employing a different set of tradeoffs such as deployment,\r\nbandwidth, and possibly delay.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Because the project relies on knowing a user's\r\nlocation, the project will enable location-based services. These are\r\nhighly desired but cannot be implemented in today's networks. This\r\nproject will build on our existing research, prototyping efforts, and\r\nan existing testbed.",
