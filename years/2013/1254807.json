 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mathematics research project will focus on the stochastic analysis of two kinds of  Brownian motions: on high-dimensional flat spaces, and on  unitary groups, the latter giving a model for random continuous rotations of space.  Such processes will be studied in conjunction with another class of stochastic objects: the spectral theory of large random matrices.  Random matrix theory is a recently developed research area that has garnered much attention in the last two decades.  It beautifully combines many fields of mathematics and has important outside applications, for example to multivariate statistics and cellular communication networks.  Using contemporary techniques from stochastic analysis,    the principal investigator Todd  Kemp will explore the behavior of large random matrices,  realized as concrete infinite-dimensional objects. The research uses the tools of free probability: a robust, growing field which incorporates ideas from probability theory, complex analysis, operator algebras, and combinatorics.  The problems to be addressed will give new insight into the fluctuations and deformations of random matrix models in free probability and are designed to yield more complete solutions to important open problems relating to entropy and information in such systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mathematics research project is in the general area of free probability theory and Brownian motions. The notion of  Brownian motion  is central to analysis, and is important in geometry, applied mathematics, and beyond.  Brownian motion is used to model many processes throughout science and engineering: from the fluctuations of stock prices to the large-scale behavior of queueing systems in computer or biological networks, to the core behavior of quantum systems.  Stochastic analysis is the systematic theory of the behavior of  Brownian  motion.  Besides its research value, another, equally central impact of this mathematics research project is through its educational goals, focusing on the creation of a new summer research program, CURE: Collaborative Undergraduate Research Experience.   It is designed to give research experience to groups of primarily local undergraduate students.  The CURE program seeks to introduce novice mathematicians to the community of practice, through situated learning and cooperative engagement in front-line research, based on the more accessible and computational aspects of the research component of  this proposal.  It will also provide mentoring experience to graduate students who will assist in coordinating the research effort; thus the CURE program is vertically integrated across the full spectrum of academic research.  Mathematics has become an increasingly collaborative field; the CURE program will instill the value of research collaboration in its dozens of participants.  By promoting diversity and developing the talent of young mathematicians, this project will increase the profile of free probability, random matrices, and stochastic analysis for the next generation of researchers",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project focused on three main objectives.\n\n1. Research in the areas of free probability, random matrices, and stochastic analysis.\n\n2. Supervision of PhD student.\n\n3. CURE: Collaborative Undergraduate Research Experience\n\nAll of these objectives were met with great success over the six years of funding provided by this CAREER Award.\n\nDuring the duration of this award, the PI supervised the research of four PhD students: David Zimmermann, Ching Wei Ho, Alice Zhuo-Yu Chan, and Evangelos (Vaki) Nikitopoulos.  Zimmermann defended his thesis in 2015, and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Chicago.  He now works at Google.  Ching Wei Ho defended his thesis in 2018, and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Indiana.  He is now bound for Academia Sinica, the National Academy of Taiwan, where he will take up a tenure-track (permanent) research position.  Alice Chan defended her thesis in Fall 2019.  Vaki Nikitopoulos is (as of this writing) a current PhD candidate, with many research papers submitted for publication and a bright future.\n\nThis award allowed the PI to create a robust, flexible summer research program (CURE) to serve the needs of the UC San Diego undergraduate mathematics majors.  Each year, 4-5 students have spent an intensive 8-week program working with the PI, a graduate research fellow, and often a junior faculty member, in a collaborative program to develop tools and solve a research problem in cutting edge mathematics related to the areas of study in the grant.  Through CURE, the PI has mentored 22 undergraduate students (14 women and 8 men) and 6 graduate students (2 women and 4 men) over the six-year course of this grant.  The vast majority of the undergraduate participants (at least 20) went on to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields (mathematics, statistics operations research, and financial engineering).\n\nThrough the course of this grant, the PI published 13 papers in peer-reviewed, highly regarded mathematics journals, on the topics mentioned above.  There were many different, interconnected themes in these research papers.  One overall research directions which was addressed in more than half of them is Brownian motion in high-dimensional spaces of symmetries.  The collection of all possible symmetries of an object or space is itself an important space studied throughout mathematics and physics.  For example: on a sphere, all symmetries are rigid motions: rotations and reflections.  Imagine executing a continuous but random sequence of such symmetries; in a scaling limit as the steps get smaller and closer together, there is an amazing object called Brownian motion.  Brownian motion (so-named by Albert Einstein in his PhD work in 1905, as a statistical model introduced to explain the motion of pollen on apparently still water observed by botanist Robert Brown half a century earlier) underlies the motion of molecules in a gas, the flow of heat, and even the fluctuations of stock prices.  The PI\u2019s work has focused on understanding Brownian motion through groups of symmetries, as the dimension grows large.  His work has uncovered patterns and techniques that have formed a new understanding of the asymptotic behavior of these kinds of Brownian motions, that will be mined and explored further by the PI and others for many years to come.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd A Kemp"
