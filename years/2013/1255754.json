 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to investigate the effectiveness of adaptive power conditioning in averting failures and enhancing reliability of mixed-signal multi-core Systems-on-Chips (SoCs), while retaining power efficiency. The investigation aims to leverage the increasing integration of non-intrusive sensors for monitoring various operational parameters and cost-effective tuning knobs for calibrating circuit performance through online power condition adjustment. The project aims to develop a cross-layer intelligent system, which will continuously adjust the flow of the entire power distribution network based on the feedback provided by the sensors. Ultimately, the aspiration of this project is to demonstrate that a holistic approach to adaptive power conditioning can (i) ensure operational robustness while minimizing power consumption, and (ii) enhance reliability and prolong life expectancy of integrated circuits. The intellectual contribution of this work will be in the development of a practical, yet theoretically rooted and analytically supported intelligent system for capturing correlations between circuit performance, sensor readings, and calibration knob positions, and utilizing them to improve robustness and reliability. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is complemented by educational and outreach activities demonstrating the principle investigators' (PIs') commitment to an integrated role as researchers, educators, and active community members. A new graduate-level course will be developed and offered by the PIs, who have proven track records of involving the students of various levels in their research activities, including women and other under-represented groups. Several opportunities for participation in interdisciplinary research spanning Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics as well as internships with industrial partners are expected.",
