The rates at which sediments are produced by glacial erosion rates in space and time, however, remain poorly understood. To improve understanding we use computers to model this distribution throughout the St. Elias Mountains for the last 100,000 years, a period representative of the late Quaternary when the regional ice masses underwent major fluctuations. The simulations use an ice sheet model validated through comparisons of model results for the glaciers under the current climate with the known characteristics of existing glaciers in the region. The simulations show that, despite major fluctuations in ice extent, average erosion rates for the principal glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains are relatively constant both in time and space, the latter being due to major valleys controlling where glaciers flow. We compare model results to published erosion rate estimates inferred from mineral data (thermo-chronology) from Southern Alaska to test our erosion model. When averaged over an entire 100,000 year-glacial cycle, the modeled glacier power (energy per unit time and per unit area) accounts for nearly 70% of the variation in the erosion rate data throughout this orogen despite the large variations in bedrock types (and resistance to erosion) and in uplift rates.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this study was to assess the quantity of sediments produced by glaciers in southern Alaska because of their potential influence on hazards associated with the Alaska Aleutian Seismogenic Zone. It was part of the GeoPRISM research effort on this Seismogenic Zone.\n\nIntroduction \n\nThick ice sheets have recurrently covered large portions of Alaska and NW North America during the last few million years (the Quaternary period). The NW portion of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, which intermittently covered the southern part of Alaska, likely influenced tectonic and volcanic processes, including seismicity, recurrent though the massive production of sediments, loading the earth?s crust with ice and sediments, their thermal effects, and the transport of water into the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. This interaction between climate and tectonic processes, as moderated by glacial advances through the last few million years, is critical to understanding the nature and evolution of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system as outlined in the Alaska GeoPRISM Implementation Plan.\n\nWe developed, validated and calibrated computer models of 1) the extent, thickness, and speed (dynamics) of the northern portion of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet under a major glaciation representative of the last million year or more, and 2) the glacial erosion and production of sediments by this ice sheet that ultimately reach the trench along the subduction zone. We quantify the glacial erosion rate, which varies in space and time, and the corresponding rate of production of sediment using a model representing the physics of crustal loading, ice masses, and glacial erosion as influenced by climate fluctuations.  The unprecedented results from our numerical modeling efforts, guided by field data, promise to contribute fundamentally to the understanding of a prime science topic of the Subduction Cycles and Deformation (SCD) Initiative: the along-strike variation in the tectonics and seismicity of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system.\n\nLocal convergence between major plates of the earth?s crust and rapid erosion have created the highest coastal topography in the world, the St. Elias Mountains, SE Alaska. The rates at which sediments are produced by glacial erosion rates in space and time, however, remain poorly understood. To improve understanding we use computers to model this distribution throughout the St. Elias Mountains for the last 100,000 years, a period representative of the late Quaternary when the regional ice masses underwent major fluctuations. The simulations use an ice sheet model validated through comparisons of model results for the glaciers under the current climate with the known characteristics of existing glaciers in the region. The simulations show that, despite major fluctuations in ice extent, average erosion rates for the principal glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains are relatively constant both in time and space, the latter being due to major valleys controlling where glaciers flow. We compare model results to published erosion rate estimates inferred from mineral data (thermo-chronology) from Southern Alaska to test our erosion model. When averaged over an entire 100,000 year-glacial cycle, the modeled glacier power (energy per unit time and per unit area) accounts for nearly 70% of the variation in the erosion rate data throughout this orogen despite the large variations in bedrock types (and resistance to erosion) and in uplift rates. This supports the underlying hypothesis that erosion primarily scales the amount of energy available for erosion of the glacier bed. It also provides calibration for this scaling for the St. Elias region.\n\nIndependent of the computer models, we have also developed an intuitive theoretical model of the influence of climate and topography on erosion rates validated using independent data from the southern hemisphere (Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula).  It adds considerable confidence to the hypothesis that erosion scales with power.\n\nThis research contributes to understanding the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone, which has considerable societal relevance, primarily due to the impact of earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. It may also help understand specific glacier-related hazards, including those associated with the formation of thick sedimentary packages that influence regional seismicity and response (e.g. the Bootlegger Cove clay that liquefided in Anchorage during the 1964 earthquake), or those that can help generate large landsides and tsunamis.  For example, a massive tsunami and earth shock, large enough to be detected in distant seismometers, resulted from a 60-million m3 landslide ramming into Taan Fiord in Alaska on 17 October 2015.\n\nIn addition, this research has rich implications for helping better understand both our past and future by 1) better defining physical conditions influencing human migration into the Americas along both the glaciated coast of Alaska and the \"ice free corridor\", and 2) helping predict the demise of glaciers from the mountains of Alaska due to the warming climate, and the global societal consequences of its significant contribution to sea level rise.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bernard Hallet"
