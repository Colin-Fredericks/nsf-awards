 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID) will collect perishable damage data caused by Hurricane Sandy that made landfall on October 29, 2012. It was a very large storm (almost 800 miles in diameter according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that affected large areas of coastlines of New York (Long Island and New York Metropolitan area) and New Jersey. The storm was judged to be Category 1 based on its wind speed. However, because of its size and coinciding with high lunar tide, it generated high storm surge. The New York Metropolitan area sustained severe damage to coastal structures due to surge and wave actions. Most of the Metropolitan area lost electrical power and the transportation system became inoperable because of flooding of tunnels and loss of power. The project will collect data on flooded areas, high water marks and structural damage. Field trips are planned to collect flood records, hydrodynamic load estimates and damage to infrastructure. A number of students from regions severely affected by the Hurricane Sandy will participate in the data collection efforts.\r\n\r\nThe data collection effort will proceed with reviews of news reports, assessment of damage through field observations, records of government agencies, and discussion with city officials. A preliminary investigation on the validation of the computational model developed by PI will be pursued with collected data. The project will have a significant broader impact because of a unique opportunity of collecting real life data. The personnel participating in the damage data collection will have an excellent experience in effects of hurricane on urban area.",
