These not well defined networks are essential for the coordination of cellular processes in response to changes in environmental inputs and are vital for survival under high-stress conditions. It is proposed to map and characterize a regulatory network in Zymomonas mobilis using a method developed in the PI's laboratory and to investigate a model regulatory RNA that was found to differentially express based on oxygen levels.  The proposed research is scientifically significant because it will provide new fundamental insight into how large-scale molecular networks that involve both RNAs and proteins operate in the context of the cellular machinery.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the PI will focus educational efforts on attracting and retaining underrepresented students to engineering by (i) creating a \"Raising Future Scientist\" program for students and their families, (ii) developing a new course to present bioengineering in the context of significant world problems, and (iii) continuing commitment to the existing undergraduate research program.",
