 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Longwood University to organize a training program for Ambassadors to support implementation of recommendations made in the Vision and Change report as part of the mission of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE). In September 2012, the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH/NIGMS, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in undergraduate biology education. Fellows were selected from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities, and research universities. The Fellows organized into four working groups with the overarching goal of helping life science departments transform their programs in a national effort to increase student learning of core concepts, increase student retention in the sciences, and prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.\r\n \r\nThe Vision and Change report contained a number of recommendations for improving undergraduate life sciences education but did not furnish an implementation strategy.  The current award is to train a cadre of Fellows to become external facilitators or \"Ambassadors\" who will visit college and university life science departments and assist with local planning and implementation.  With support from a consultant, the Spreading the PULSE Working Group will develop, test, and implement an Ambassador training program.  The initial cohort of Ambassadors will later train other Fellows and, as the program grows, members of the broader community to become Ambassadors.  The V&C Rubrics, developed by the Taking the PULSE Working Group, will serve as a blueprint for departments to evaluate their own progress in adopting the V&C recommendations. In conjunction with this self-assessment, a department may request an on-campus visit by a team of trained Ambassadors to facilitate rich dialog about educational transformation and provide guidance and resources for moving forward with the implementation of reforms. The Spreading the PULSE Working Group is building a \"Toolkit\" of resources that departments can use when reforming their approach to teaching undergraduates.  From its beginning, assessment of this organizational change effort will be a central consideration, and the dissemination of the methods and outcomes of that assessment will serve other projects seeking to foster department-level innovation and transformation.  Information about the Rubrics, Ambassadors program, and Toolkit is available on the www.pulsecommunity.org website; all items will be updated as more departments field-test them over the next one to two years.  Results from the PULSE project will be posted on the pulsecommunity website and shared with the life sciences community at professional meetings. \r\n \r\nThis project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2011 report, Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education &ndash; A Call to Action, by the American Association for the Advancement of Science was a call for faculty to improve pedagogy and curriculum, but to do so they need both support and professional development.  The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) seeks to \"catalyze undergraduate life sciences departmental transformation, aligned with current education reform reports, including the Vision and Change Report (2011), leading to inclusive, student-centered, evidence-based teaching and learning to cultivate the development of scientists who reflect the diversity of American society.\"  The PULSE Ambassadors program [A Vision for Change: Using ATP (Ambassador Training Program) to Energize Departmental Transformation; NSF 1355771] is one piece of that overall effort.\n\nOver a 36-month period, the Ambassador project team developed and implemented a training program for PULSE Ambassadors, resulting in the preparation of 27 Ambassadors to work with life sciences departments.  Through campus workshops by teams of 2-4 Ambassadors, the project positively impacted 13 life sciences departments at diverse institutions &ndash; community colleges, minority-serving institutions, regional comprehensive universities, liberal arts colleges, and large research universities &ndash; and thereby impacted a diverse group of faculty and students.  Each Ambassador campus workshop had two key outcomes:  1) departmental faculty identified their shared vision for the unit (i.e., its curriculum, pedagogy, etc.), the barriers to reaching that desired future state, and specific action steps for overcoming barriers and 2) faculty discussed and practiced tools of critical, constructive dialog, navigating change, and managing conflict.  Thus, each Ambassador campus workshop was very much focused on organizational change within the very complex unit of the academic department.  Faculty were engaged in thinking about their work with students, curriculum, pedagogies, etc. in the context of the recommendations of Vision and Change and also within a framework that supports meaningful progress and change.  One department at a time, then, we helped faculty to impact their own pedagogical methods and curriculum by providing time, space, and tools for the difficult discussions that precede change.\n\nThis project added to the momentum of the portfolio of PULSE projects that together aim to develop \"an educated citizenry that routinely applies scientific knowledge, reasoning, and creative insight to address real-world challenges.\"  PULSE seeks to accomplish that by shifting the focus of transformation and the locus of support from individual faculty members to entire departments.  The Ambassadors project engaged whole departments and their supervising administrators on their own campuses.  The V&amp;C Online Toolkit, developed as part of this project, is an important, freely available resource that provides easy access to the rich and evolving ecosystem of national Vision and Change efforts.  It is a resource for individuals and whole departments as they seek to further their reform efforts, be they independent, beyond the Ambassador campus workshop, or in conjunction with another PULSE project.\n\nSince the Ambassador project is connected with all other ongoing PULSE projects (e.g., V&amp;C rubrics, regional workshops, online resources), this project built synergy for a more significant impact on national efforts to improve STEM teaching and learning.  The Ambassadors project affected pedagogical methods in the field by engaging departments in critical dialog about the implementation of the Vision and Change recommendations in their unique contexts.  With broad-scale implementation of the recommendations of Vision and Change, students at all types of institutions will be focused more on process and core concepts than on facts.  Though this project contributed to a small part of that, concerted, coordinated efforts over time will have significant effects on human resources in the field and thereby support national initiatives for a diverse and well-qualified STEM workforce.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alix D Fink"
