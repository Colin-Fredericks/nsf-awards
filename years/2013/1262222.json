 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to The University of Iowa that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The scientific focus of the research program is microbiology. The purposes of the program are to encourage students to pursue a career in basic science and give them the skills to succeed in that path. The Department of Microbiology has about 25 faculty who will serve as mentors. Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student co-mentor. Lectures, workshops and social activities will expose students to graduate school and other career options, will include training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and will promote informal interactions. At the end of the summer, students will present their findings at a University-wide symposium. Students will also be encouraged to present their findings at regional and national meetings.  Students will receive a stipend and money for travel and living expenses. The program is open to undergraduates who are interested in scientific research and are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Recruitment will use both traditional mailings and various forms of electronic outreach. Special emphasis will be given to recruitment of students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges where opportunities for research are lacking. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in the biological sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The impact and success of the program will be assessed by various means, including tracking of students and use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/summer/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Weiss at david-weiss@uiowa.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Linda McCarter at linda-mccarter@uiowa.edu).",

To achieve these ends, students were placed in research labs, where they carried out independent projects under the supervision of faculty mentors.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows generally served as co-mentors.  Student participants were engaged not only in the daily tasks of conducting experiments, but also in the process of formulating hypotheses, designing experiments and interpreting the results.  To foster communication skills, participants were required to present their projects in the form of a short talk, a short written report and, at the end of the summer, a poster session.  Twice a week all participants gathered with the REU Co-Directors to engage in seminars and workshops.  The subject matter varied from week to week, but included research presentations by Department faculty, instruction in Responsible Conduct of Research, and workshops on career opportunities, the graduate school admissions process and \"survival skills for young researchers.\"  Social functions brought together students, their mentors and additional members of the department in settings that fostered interactions outside the walls of the laboratory.\n\nOverall, the program was successful in achieving its three goals.  Of the 24 participants, 18 are accepted to or enrolled in graduate programs (12 PhD, 1 MS, 4 Post Bac, 1 Medical School), 3 are still in school with 2017 projected graduation dates, and 3 are newly graduated and planning on working in labs and or applying to graduate or post-baccalaureate programs.  Surveys at the end of each summer revealed nearly 100% of the participants reported \"good to great\" gains in a variety of important skills, such as their ability to analyze data, solve problems, work in the lab independently, and present their research to others.  About 85% reported that participation in the REU program increased the likelihood they would pursue graduate school.  About 70% of the participants were from small colleges, and nearly all of the participants, including those from larger institutions, reported the REU was their first real research experience.  In keeping with the goal of developing a diverse STEM workforce, 14 of the 24 participants were female, 14 were underrepresented minorities, 1 had a significant disability and 2 were non-traditional students (&gt;30 years of age).\n\nWe are particularly proud of the contributions our REU participants have made towards pushing back the frontiers of knowledge.  Despite the constraint of only having 10 weeks to work in the lab, over half of the students made enough progress that they were able to present their findings at national or regional scientific meetings, and two students won awards for their poster presentations at ABRCMS.  Overall, the data clearly indicate the REU in Microbiology at The University of Iowa achieved its goals during the 2013-2015 funding period.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Weiss"
