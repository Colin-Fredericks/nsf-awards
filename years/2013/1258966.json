 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bellevue College STEM Scholars Network provides support for up to 50 academically talented and financially disadvantaged students through graduation with associate degrees in STEM fields.  The STEM disciplines targeted by the STEM Scholars Network include Earth and Space Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Engineering and Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The cohort-building activities, significant involvement of local industry and academic support structures incorporated into the STEM Scholars Network provide a model for other similar institutions to adapt and implement to facilitate graduation of community college STEM majors.  The engagement of STEM professionals with faculty and students promotes new understandings of effective teaching and learning strategies, as well as approaches for effective integration of resources from academia and industry. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Partnerships with local companies developed and strengthened through this project are adding to the role the college plays to provide talented STEM professionals to the local workforce.  Further, by encouraging participation of underrepresented groups, this project increases access to educational and professional pathways for diverse students, including women, students of color and economically disadvantaged students, thereby diversifying the STEM workforce.  Dissemination of these important findings to pre-college teachers, college faculty, administrators and industry leaders throughout Washington state and nationally will inform better strategies for broadening the participation of the nation's underprivileged populations in STEM fields.",

The STEM Scholars Network was created to assist at-risk students enroll full-time, complete degree programs in STEM fields, and successfully transfer to baccalaureate institutions or transition into the workforce. The specific mission of the STEM Scholars Network was to encourage and enable more Bellevue College students to become highly skilled employees in scientific and technical areas of need in the Puget Sound region and in the nation by providing financial scholarships and industry-integrated STEM student support initiatives to at-risk, financially needy and academically talented students.</p>\n<p>The three key objectives of the program were to: (1) provide funding to at least 10 incoming cohort students pursuing STEM degrees who showed financial need; (2) implement a support program (including elements such as cohort classes and faculty/ professional mentoring) to help students succeed with their coursework and eventual attainment of degrees or transfers to other colleges or universities; and (3) simultaneously develop a recruiting program that focused on STEM-specific secondary schools. Each of these objectives was developed with a focus on incorporating more diverse groups of students into STEM fields and with the ultimate goal of ensuring that students were able to obtain the needed education to connect them with STEM jobs in the Puget Sound region.</p>\n<p>The program has shown outcomes that have consistently exceeded its goals?in 7 years, a total of 81 students received a STEM Scholarship award and on average 89% of second-year students continued in STEM studies after the scholarship ended. Participation in the Summer Bridge program has exceeded the program?s goals, but more importantly student feedback consistently notes that all support components (pictured below) helped them to connect with others and to become more successful with their STEM studies. Recruitment efforts have grown to include networks with an increased number of campus partners across Bellevue College and professional organizations, along with participation in a range of STEM meetings and events for high school students in the region.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the STEM Scholars program include the building of STEM talent and the consistent engagement of a wider audience with the STEM fields about how STEM can serve to build society. By focusing on those with demonstrated financial need, the Scholars program has expanded accessibility to many with an interest in and talent for STEM learning and research. Building that talent requires several levels of support as well as connection with the applied work that is conducted in both the public and private sectors. Scholars become part of the STEM to Stern program which provides structured cohort-based classes with faculty and professional mentoring and presentations as well as experiential learning opportunities such as internships, jobs, and short-term or long-term STEM projects. These types of projects coupled with existing partnerships with STEM professionals and organizations support the building of networks among program participants within both the academic environment of Bellevue College and the professional STEM environment of the Puget Sound region.</p>\n<p>The STEM Scholars program itself continues to build networks for information-sharing through partnerships with the Bellevue College outreach team, the Research Innovation Service and Experiential (RISE) Learning Institute, and an array of STEM employers and organizations. Program staff consistently meet with area high schools in an effort to continue the dialogue about STEM opportunities and to reach more potential future Scholars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ryan&nbsp;Bauer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601593764550_STEMMentorClusters--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601593764550_STEMMentorClusters--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Mentor Clusters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601593764550_STEMMentorClusters--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Mentor Clusters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM Mentor Clusters</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">STEM Program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ryan&nbsp;Bauer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Mentor Clusters</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601586688990_STEMBridge--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601586688990_STEMBridge--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Bridge Program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601586688990_STEMBridge--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Bridge Program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM Bridge Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">STEM Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ryan&nbsp;Bauer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Bridge Program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601570808346_STEMInternship-AstrobiologyNASA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1258966/1258966_10271386_1601570808346_STEMInternship-AstrobiologyNASA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Internship -
