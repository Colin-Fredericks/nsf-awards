This multidisciplinary research will include MOCVD growth of ZnO and MgZnO nanostructures with controlled dimension and morphology, design and experiments of chemical binding of molecular linker layers, comprehensive characterization of the ZnO/organic molecule interfaces, and implementation of the functionalization technology for sensing applications. The main approach includes (i) synthesis of highly ordered ZnO and MgZnO nanostructures with controlled dimension, morphologies, and surface wettability; (ii) Study of the photophysical and chemical properties between these nanostructures and the molecular linker layers designed by using the probe chromophores to achieve unprecedented understanding of the interfacial chemistry, and (iii) Implementation of the interfacial chemistry to design and develop the surface functionalization technology for application in the ZnO nanostructure-based biosensors.\r\n\r\nGeneral public statement:\r\nThis project will study how molecules important in sensor development, for example antibodies or enzymes, may be immobilized on nanomaterials.  Ensuring that biomolecules function well after immobilization is critical to the successful development of biosensors and this proposal will develop new immobilization strategies.",

However, considerably less information on the interfaces between nanostructured ZnO and organic molecules is available due to the difficulty of chemical functionalization, resulted from instability of ZnO to most acids and bases. Our research enabled a unique solution to this problem by synthesis of highly ordered MZO nanostructures with tailored magnesium (Mg) composition. The MZO nanostructured films possess finely tuned surface morphologies controlled wettability, and low bio-toxicity by reducing Zn-ions. We achieved uniformity and efficiency of the surface bound molecular layer and studied in-depth the mechanism of interfacial chemistry behavior for the surface functionalization of ZnO and MZO. &nbsp;The infrared techniques allowed imaging of the binding process.
