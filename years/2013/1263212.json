 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are natural laboratories for investigating Earth surface processes mediated by fresh water in the zone extending from the top of the vegetation canopy to the base of groundwater, i.e. the Critical Zone. This award supports the participation of undergraduate students and teachers in research at two Critical Zone Observatories, the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Observatory (SSHO) in central Pennsylvania and the Christina River Basin (CRB) CZO in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware. Pennsylvania State University is the lead institution of the SSHO and would collaborate with the Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC), a partner in the CRB CZO. The collaborative project will fund a total of 12 undergraduate students and 4 teachers at these sites per year, providing research experiences for undergraduates primarily interested in Earth Science careers and K-12 teachers who want to increase their content knowledge and resources for the classroom. At the CRB, participants will be involved in research investigating aspects of the impact of three centuries of human habitation on the carbon and water cycles. At the SSHO, participants will be involved in research to quantitatively predict the creation, evolution and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphological processes operating in the temperate, forested landscape. After the summer experience, participants will prepare and give presentations at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  CZOs offer a unique opportunity for training undergraduate students and teachers via research experiences because of the broad array of environmental landscapes represented by the observatories and the interdisciplinary science achieved through the observatory framework.",

This process exposed the students in a short amount of time to some of the experiences (and stress) they will encounter in graduate school, or within any government or private sector job in science.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project was a success as proposed. The project leadership learned a lot about introducing the concept of critical zone science to early career scientists and those otherwise lacking knowledge of the term and related concepts, and were able to develop and evolve an effective approach through the course of the project. This success has carried through in the submission of an in-review proposal to NSF for another REU/RET Site project to be run collaboratively between the Shale Hills and Calhoun Forest CZOs; and, in the planning and development of an international CZO school to be held in Italy during summer 2018.</p>\n<p>The energy generated by the participants led to greater accomplishments than we had imagined. Those achievements include: multiple teacher workshops and related formal professional development units for attending teachers; and, representation and exposure of critical zone science at diverse disciplinary science meetings, through the participation of our teachers and students at professional meetings during their summer experience, but also through follow-on presentations by them and their mentors. Most importantly is the decision by at least four of our undergraduate participants to attend graduate school to work in CZ science within the CZO network, and that our teachers have since incorporated related lessons into their classrooms.</p>\n<p>It is our contention that society will more easily achieve environmental sustainability if our citizenry understands the concepts of interconnectedness between physical, biological and chemical processes and functions in the critical zone. Our program has succeeded in promoting this idea and the leadership is poised to continue doing so. The following testimonials show impact the program has made in the academic and personal perspective of its participants.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.the REU program clearly had a very direct influence on my life and career path. Not only did the program help me to decide what I wanted to study as I moved forward with my education, but it was also what convinced me to apply and go to graduate school straight out of undergrad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think back often about Shale Hills, the incredible people and the amount I learned working in the REU program. For the last 11 months, I managed a citizen science water quality monitoring program.&hellip;.. The REU influenced me to continue working in environmental science, and drove me to find a nonprofit where I could continue with fieldwork and data collection while being more involved with a community. The REU also planted a drive in me to pursue a masters degree&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think my time at the CZO definitely led me to take more interdisciplinary coursework in the semesters following it, rather than just straight geology classes. It really helped to enforce the need for researchers of different disciplines to work together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While I haven't had any more direct CZ involvement, I have found myself looking at the environment through the CZ lens. I have always been interested in interactions between systems, and the CZO REU taught me how to approach that interest scientifically.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast
