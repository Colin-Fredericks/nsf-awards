 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Professor Tehshik Yoon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Professor Tehshik Yoon will develop new ways to control the synthesis of aminoalcohols.  These groups are responsible for the selective binding of many drugs and drug-like molecules to biological receptors.  In order for a drug to bind tightly and with high selectivity for one target over countless others in a cell, these N and O groups must be introduced with a specific spatial orientation.  The methods developed in this project employ an innovative strategy that allows for exquisite control over the molecular shape of aminoalcohols using inexpensive, non-toxic iron and copper catalysts. \r\n\r\nDue to the importance of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in biological chemistry, this work has the potential to impact the manufacture and discovery of a wide variety of medicines, agrochemicals, and biomaterials.  Given that the reactions involve sustainable base-metal catalysts, these methods could also result in the reduction of toxic wastes in the manufacturing of aminoalcohol-based compounds.  In addition, this project will enable the development of new strategies to use social media in scientific and educational outreach, including to populations historically underrepresented in the sciences.",
