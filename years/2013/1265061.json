 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical abstract\r\nDetection of specific nucleic acid (NA) sequences is crucial to infectious disease\r\ndiagnostics, genetic screening for hereditary diseases, personalized medicine, criminology,\r\npaternity disputes, and animal and plant breeding, among many other applications. Although\r\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, coupled with oligonucleotide array chips, has\r\nenabled specific identification of multiple sequences present in a sample at very low copy\r\nnumber, this method requires added labels and reagents to detect the target NA. These labels\r\nand the hardware (e.g., optics) required to sense them significantly increase the analysis time,\r\ncost, and footprint of devices for detecting specific NA sequences.  As an alternative to current approaches, this project will develop novel nanopores capable of detecting pathogenic nucleic acids with single molecule resolution.  These nanopores will be fabricated in silicon and will be engineered to contain beads labeled with complementary NA sequences.  Binding of target oligonucleotides to the beads will result in the change of electrophoretic properties and will lead to nanopores becoming occluded by the beads.  This event will be detected electrochemically for binary yes/no readout of the target NA.  \r\n\r\nNon-technical abstract\r\nThere is a need to develop simple and inexpensive methods for detecting pathogens for medical or food safety applications.  This proposal will develop a new approach based on small pores containing beads.  The beads will react to pathogen biomarkers, will clog the pores and will result in the change of electrical current.  This method is envisioned to have improved sensitivity and be simpler than the current approaches.",

Such a device could offer a relatively inexpensive and rapid means to detect microbial pathogens in body fluids, food and water.  The three objectives of this project were to 1. Scale down the device from the microscale to the nanoscale using silicon-processing technology; 2. Design and demonstrate the device for detection of E. coli K-12 16S rRNA; and 3. Detect pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 in aqueous solution at practically relevant concentration.  Due primarily to insurmountable noise related issues, we switched to the use of glass chips from silicon as the basis for our sensing device.  This necessitated the development of a novel method to micromachine the devices from glass wafers.  A number of other technical hurdles were overcome as well that enabled us to pursue aggressively a detection limit study using E. coli 16S rRNA as the target.  We successfully demonstrated detection at 1 aM (10-18 M), which corresponds to less than one bacterial cell per milliliter.  Further, this detection limit held even in the presence of a million-fold (1 pM) background of RNA from another bacterium, P. putida.  Studies with P. putida RNA alone gave no false positives and false negatives were observed only at E. coli 16S rRNA concentrations less than 1 aM.  Although we did not address the third objective of this project, the detection of pathogenic E. coli, we have established the promise of a new detection technology that is competitive with (if not better than) amplification based approaches for nucleic acid detection without the use of expensive reagents (e.g., polymerases, primers, nucleotides), enzymatic and/or fluorescent labels, and optics.  Further, as we demonstrated early in this project, detection signals can be monitored with very inexpensive electronics.

The hope is that some of these students subsequently will pursue an interest in research and will go on to graduate school in the sciences and engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold G Monbouquette"
