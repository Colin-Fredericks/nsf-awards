 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exchange of heat and chemical species between the surface and interior of the Earth are controlled by plate tectonics.  Specifically, the Earth?s plates are recycled back into the mantle at subduction zones, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another.  During subduction some of the material from the descending plate is returned to surface forming the Earth?s crust.  Much of this transport occurs via melting of the subducted material and subsequent volcanism at the surface, however, buoyant material can also return to the surface via solid-state flow in ?diapirs?.  The goal of this project is to study the rise of these buoyant diapirs using a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical models.  We will use these models to ascertain where and when diapirs form and to determine the relationship between diapir characteristics (volume/buoyancy) and ascent paths from the descending slab to the surface.  Because buoyant diapirs will have different chemical signatures than the melts generated directly from the subducting plate, understanding the efficiency of this process is critical for determining chemical evolution of the Earth.  This project will also support the education of a PhD student and a post-doctoral research fellow.\r\n\r\nWhile many previous studies have investigated mantle flow driven by the subducting slab, relatively few have focused on the ascent of buoyant material from the slab back to the surface.  In this project we will characterize the 3 stages of diapir evolution: formation stage, rise stage, and arrival stage, and determine how each is influenced by the plate-driven mantle wedge flow field.  The laboratory experiments will be used to model the pathways and interaction of ascending diapirs in three dimensions as a function of specific aspects of the plate-driven flow field, including slab rollback, along-strike variations in slab geometry (e.g., slab edges, gaps, changes in dip), and deformation of the overriding plate.  Diapirs will be initiated assuming different buoyancy sources including a point source, line source, and sheet of buoyant material on the surface of the down-going slab.  We expect that diapir ascent paths will be strongly influenced by diapir volume (buoyancy) flux and the pattern of flow in the mantle wedge?potentially resulting in large horizontal net transport of buoyant slab-derived material to the surface.  High-resolution numerical models will then be used to study melting and melt-matrix interaction within the spectrum of ascending diapirs based upon density contrast, diapir size, path shape and transit time.  Such models are important for characterizing chemical differentiation within diapirs.  Combining the laboratory experiments with the numerical models, we will be able to place important new constraints on how chemical signals can be transported from the slab to the surface in subduction zones.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlate tectonics describes the processes by which the Earth?s tectonic plates collide and move apart.  Subduction zones occur where one tectonic plate dives beneath another and descends into the underlying mantle.  Many of Earth?s most devastating natural hazards occur at subduction zones including major earthquakes, tsunamis, and explosive volcanic eruptions.  In this study, we investigated the region of melt generation within subduction zones and in particular how buoyant material on the subducting plate can be removed and ascend back towards the surface.  As this buoyant material ascends it melts, providing the magmas that source island arc volcanos, such as those observed in the \"Ring of Fire\" around the Pacific Ocean Basin. \n\nIn this collaborative research with the University of Rhode Island, we coupled numerical models with laboratory experiments to study the process by which this buoyant material is transported to the surface in \"diapirs\" and the extent to which these diapirs melt during their ascent.  These models simulate both viscous flow in the Earth?s mantle (much like that observed in a lava lamp), as well as the more rapid transport of melt via porous flow through the mantle.  Our model results illuminate the conditions under which diapirs separate from the subducting slab and are transported to melting zone beneath arc volcanos.  Further, we quantified the chemical evolution of these melts and how they would be expressed in arc volcanos.  It is through these processes that the Earth?s continental crust is created and modified through geologic time.\n\nThe results of our study, and the new numerical and experimental techniques developed through this project will benefit studies of subduction zone dynamics with broad applications in Earth sciences through NSF programs such as GeoPRISMS, Earthscope, and the Cascadia Initiative.  The time-dependent visualizations of our experiments and numerical models make exceptionally stimulating and intuitive illustrations that have been used in classroom lectures and K-12 outreach activities by the PIs.  Finally, a major impact of this study was supporting the postdoctoral research of Dr. Nan Zhang at WHOI.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Behn"
