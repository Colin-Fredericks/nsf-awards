 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is motivated by the observation that the battery drain of an app in a mobile device is user-centric, i.e., it depends on several factors that are associated with specific usage patterns.  These factors include but are not limited to the mode in which the app is used, the network coverage that the user enjoys and whether or not certain features of the app are turned on/off. In this project, the objectives are to (i) develop a fundamental understanding of the factors that influence the energy consumption of smartphone apps and, (ii) based on the understanding obtained, design and implement a user-centric battery management system that is called BLT.   \r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to first undertake an extensive measurement study that will provide a comprehensive understanding of how and to what extent user-centric factors affect the energy consumption on a smartphone. Subsequently, they aim to tackle several challenges towards identifying the energy hungry apps on a user's smartphone;  some of these challenges include the presence of several coexisting active apps at any given time.   Finally, they will design and implement a set of solutions that allow a user to trade-off performance or content quality for energy savings.  This project hinges on a strong experimental and prototyping effort, and the PIs will leverage the smartphone testbeds at UC Riverside and UC Davis towards undertaking the same.\r\n\r\nThe project will have an immediate broader impact in empowering users with an ability to control their battery usage.  It will also allow users and developers in understanding why activities and apps result in high battery drain.  The project will also undertake efforts towards inspiring K-12 students in our respective regions, and helping teachers develop projects for science olympiads.  The project will include the modification of wireless networking courses taught at UCD and UCR, and  new educational efforts on establishing courses that include design and implementation on mobile devices.",
