 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than half of all known species are insects.  The hemipteroid insects, which include true bugs, leafhoppers, aphids, thrips, and parasitic lice, comprise over 120,000 described species, about 12% of insect diversity.  This group of insects contains many species of crop pests as well as human disease vectors.  The goals of this project are to understand the family tree of relationships for the hemipteroids by sampling 170 target species covering the diversity of this group.  Data for analysis will include over 1000 genes sequenced from complete genomes and a large morphological data set of over 300 characters.\r\n\r\nThis project is scientifically important because there is little consensus regarding the family level taxonomic relationships of this group of insects.  The large amount of data collected in the course of this project should conclusively solve this problem.  The findings will also have considerable broader significance.  For example, data from the genomes of these insects may reveal new strategies for control of the crop pest insects included in the study.  This project will also include training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral researchers.  Public outreach activities will include a Tree of Life display for a Mobile Science Center and Bug ID cards.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInsects are the most diverse group of animals on earth, with over one million currently recognized species, but the relative positions of most insect species on the Tree of Life remain unknown or controversial.  Reconstructing this Tree of Life by showing how species are related to each other is key to understanding the origins of this tremendous diversity.  This project addressed this problem for one major group, the hemipteroid insects, comprising over 120,000 known species.  This group includes three insect orders: Psocodea (bark lice and parasitic lice), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids, scale insects, psyllids, whiteflies, moss bugs, planthoppers, cicadas, spittlebugs, leafhoppers, treehoppers, and true bugs).  Hemipteroids are among the most abundant and economically important insects, including major agricultural pests and vectors of plant and animal diseases.  To provide a robust tree for hemipteroid insects, the genomes and transcriptomes (expressed genes) of over 600 species were sequenced and analyzed. Comparisons of the morphology of these insects were also conducted to put the results into the context of morphological similarities and provide improved classifications and identification tools.\n\n \n\nResults from these efforts produced the largest genetic datasets ever assembled for hemipteroids, both in terms of number of species and amount of data per species.  As a consequence, the trees of relationships were very well supported by the data and for the most part stable across different methods of analysis, resolving some previously controversial parts of the hemipteroid Tree of Life with high confidence.  This study found that the insect order Thysanoptera (thrips) is the closest relative to the order Hemiptera.  However, the question of whether bark lice and parasitic lice are the closest relatives of these two orders was more difficult to answer, with the results differing depending on method of analysis.  Relationships within each of these three insect orders were also well-resolved.  For example, parasitic lice were found to be a highly derived group within free-living bark lice.  In general, the results provide a new basis for a stable classification scheme that helps describe how these insects are related to each other, dividing these orders into suborders, superfamilies, and families. Overall, analyses of the new genome-scale datasets supported most groups previously recognized based on morphological traits and improved our understanding of how and when key morphological and behavioral traits arose in the past.\n\n \n\nThis project also had broader impacts beyond the intellectual merits of the study.  New techniques for using genome sequences to understand how species of insects are related were developed for this study.  Two workshops were hosted by this project in which collaborators from around the world were provided training in these new techniques.  The data generated for this project have also been made publicly available to other scientists, and have utility for many additional studies related to insect genomes, including ongoing studies of the genetic basis of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits.  This project also included training opportunities for six graduate students, five undergraduate students, and three post-doctoral researchers, who were all directly involved in the project.  The results of this project were also highlighted in a public press release and press reports on the project, making these results more accessible to the public.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin P Johnson"
