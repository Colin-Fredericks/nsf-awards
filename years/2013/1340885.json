 "awd_abstract_narration": "These funds support a Workshop entitled 'Next generation climate change experiments needed to advance knowledge and for assessment of CMIP6' organized by the Aspen Global Change Institute. As we approach the end of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change fifth assessment report (IPCC AR5) process and the culmination of the extensive model intercomparison exercise of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), emerging gaps in scientific understanding lead to opportunities for new climate model experiments that explore aspects of the science best addressed through a coordinated set of model experiments. This workshop will set the initial planning for a possible CMIP6. The current timing affords a unique opportunity  to assess the accomplishments and outstanding issues with the CMIP5 process and use this to help inform the development of experimental design and research directions that can be considered for inclusion in the CMIP6 process. The range of interesting and useful science questions include the following: (i)  Land use -aerosols-ESM applications-interact with a couple of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) that show quite different outcomes from RCPs; (ii) Reversibility or geo-engineering; (iii) More idealized experiments, e.g. 1% runs but for other forcings, idealized aerosol, ozone, land use, like the 1% runs; (iv)  Decadal prediction and extremes; (v)  Systematic biases; (vi)  Very high resolution time slice experiments for tropical cyclones and other aspects of storms and circulation changes; (vii) Higher resolution coupled simulations for tropical cyclones, extremes, and circulation changes; and  (viii) Coupled land ice for better estimates of global and regional sea level rise.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will directly benefit agencies of the USGCRP and their contribution to the advancement of climate projections and predictability and the scientific process leading up to the future international assessments.",
