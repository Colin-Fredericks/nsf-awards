The central goal of the project is to document, validate, and promote CS pedagogical content knowledge, the combined knowledge of both the CS learner and CS content that enables an expert teacher to teach well.  Resources developed will enable novice teachers to perform the actions of a more advanced CS teacher, such as incorporating new teaching practices, anticipating students? difficulties, and building upon students' strengths. In addition to this practical contribution, this research will identify open research questions in CS education.",
