 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 1264808/1263940\r\nPI: Liu/Yang\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to design a novel surface that could significantly enhance rare cell capture efficacy and selectivity through synergistic research activities between Lehigh University and University of Pennsylvania, including a novel multi-scale computational model, fabrication of a 3D hierarchical surface, and a microfluidic testing platform. Specifically, we will design and fabricate a hierarchical surface consisting of patterned structures at two difference length scales: a micro-scale surface of ripples or herringbone structure and an array of nanoparticles or nanopillars. The micro-scale sinusoidal ripples and herringbone structures will generate micro-vortices to enhance cell-wall collision, provide larger adhesion area, avoid non-specific cell adhesion and possible cell damage, and enable accurate cell counting; the nanostructures will complement microvilli on cell membranes, thus, improve both interaction specificity and cell capturing efficiency. \r\n\r\nThrough a combined computational and experimental approach we expect that the proposed study will provide important insights for clinical isolation of rare cells from a blood sample. The multiscale computational modeling will be applied for the first time to guide the study of cell capture on various 3D surfaces with consideration of both hydrodynamics and adhesion dynamics. Various unique hierarchical surface designs will be integrated into a microfluidic device to validate the computational prediction and significantly improve rare cell capture performance. Specifically, we plan to: (1) Develop a multi-scale transport and adhesion dynamics model for cell capture process and perform cell capture analysis on surfaces of various designs. Characterize how various surface designs influence cell capture efficiency, throughput, and selectivity. (2) Fabricate a library of 3D hierarchical surface consisting of microscale wavy patterns (1D ripples and 2D herringbone structures) and an array of nanopillars or nanoparticles. (3) Perform microfluidic test on particle and cell capture using the fabricated hierarchical surface. Benchmark various surface designs in terms of capture efficiency, throughput, and selectively (Cheng and Liu). (4) Compare the experimental results with the computational model; optimize the model and re-engineer the hierarchical surface and the rare cell capture device. \r\n\r\nThe synergistic approach across diverse disciplines, including bioengineering, materials science, nanofabrication, and BioMEMS brings about a novel biomimetic approach to construct a lab-on-the-chip device for early cancer detection, thus making the project transformative. The research outcome will create a significant opportunity to excite the general public in bio-nanotechnology, thereby provoking and engaging their interest Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In addition, this work will offer an effective tool to recruit and train students at all levels in a highly-integrated research and educational environment. The research outcome will be disseminated through a dedicated website and tool sharing at nanoHub for posting new discoveries in cell science, materials fabrication, and computational modeling frameworks developed from this project, as well as outreach to K-12 students.",

Although various techniques were developed in literature to isolate CTCs, further improvements were still needed for device performances (such as capture efficiency, purity and viability) which were essential in producing an accurate and precise result towards precision medicine. Meanwhile, the advance of micro-/nano-techniques especially micro/nanofluidics brought lots of new approaches to solve the problems in biomedical field. Due to the nature of micro/nanofluidics such as low volume cost and fast reaction, traditional lab scale tests were scaled down to micro/nanoscale which was more fast and accurate. We were thus motivated to develop novel techniques based on micro-/nano-techniques to tackle the challenge of isolation of CTCs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, we have developed a microfluidic CTC isolation chip with wavy-HB patterns, as shown in Figure 1. By extending the hallmark grooved-HB chip proposed in Toner's group, we smoothed the sharp groove transitions into wavy patterns. This change eliminated extremely low shear rate regions in the groove troughs where WBCs were subjected to non-specific capture. Through a side-by-side comparison with state of the art grooved-HB chip, the wavy-HB patterns were demonstrated to present a better purity and viability performance, while preserve a high capture efficiency performance which was originally the main advantage of the grooved-HB chip. The wavy-HB chip was thus able to serve as a potential platform for clinical practice. Furthermore, this study does not only yield one single microfluidic chip, but also initiates a new strategy to improve the device performance by replacing the sharp groove patterns with smooth wavy patterns. This could be adopted to further improve many existed microfluidic platforms in literature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, a computational model has been developed to model cell transport, cell adhesion and its capture on microfluidic devices. Based on this model, a further optimization on HB structures for CTC capture was performed through a numerical study. By realizing the complex nature of ligand-receptor bond formation, we utilized a lumped parameter model to determine the adhesion probability through a few simple experimental tests. Then the modified CTC transport and capture model was used to optimize the HB structures in terms of various geometric parameters. We found that short arm ratio of 0.5 was optimized for tumor cell capture which is against 1/3 obtained from most studies in literature. This was mainly attributed to the bias of pure mixing effect on determining cell capture in most studies, while the particulate cell transport was missing which was significantly important in CTC capture work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, with the developed wavy-HB chip, we then explored the possibilities to integrate nanostructures to further enhance the CTC capture performance. Four techniques have been developed to fabricate 3D hierarchical surfaces for highly efficient isolation of CTCs, which is mainly attributed to the advantages brought by both wavy-HB patterns and nanostructures. We fabricated and assembled the device through a newly developed approach and then performed cancer cell isolation work by comparing the results with the state of the art. Significantly, the microfluidic CTC chip with hierarchical micro/nanostructures were demonstrated a higher capture efficiency and a similar purity. By pushing the device performance to another higher extreme, this platform indicates its capability to serve as a more effective platform for CTC isolation toward more demanding clinical practice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, one main limitation in anti-EpCAM based CTC isolation approaches is that captured CTCs are firmly trapped on the capture bed which brings the difficulty to collect them for off-chip analysis. We have developed a strategy to resolve this problem: magnetic particle assisted CTC capture and release, and cell adhesion rolling based CTC isolation (see Figure 2). The device was designed to create passive turbulence and increase the possibility of tumor cells colliding onto the device wall. Under an external magnetic field, magnetic particles (MPs) coated with anti-EpCAM against tumor cell surface protein (EpCAM) were immobilized over the wavy-HB surface to capture tumor cells. After removing the magnetic field, the captured cells with surplus MPs were released from the device and collected, thus cells could be re-cultured for further analysis. On optimized conditions, the capture efficiency of tumor cells can be as high as 92%&plusmn;2.8%.
