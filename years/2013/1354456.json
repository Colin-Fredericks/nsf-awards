It is organizing and analyzing available data from multiple existing sources to provide an annotated and coherent set of STEM metrics that can be used over time.  The dashboard integrates issues that are often separated, such as high school graduation, college enrollment and postsecondary attainment, with a particular focus on those underrepresented in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe project will take advantage of all existing data sources, and with expert input, create a web-based platform on STEM educational attainment for use by evaluators, researchers, and policymakers.\r\n\r\nWhile the risks are substantial (both technically and methodologically), there will be significant value if the project succeeds in creating coherence around STEM educational attainment.",
