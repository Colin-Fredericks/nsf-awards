This meeting will mark 50 years since the original Texas Symposium in 1963.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Symposium has gained a reputation as one of the major international meetings on topics in relativistic astrophysics, including the physics of compact objects, high-energy cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei, the early universe, and observational and theoretical cosmology.  The awarded funds cover registration, travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses to support 10 graduate students to attend the meeting.  Broader impacts of this funding are clear in terms of support for the careers of young astronomers and physicists.  \r\n",
