Such clocks hold an intriguing promise of extending the frontiers of precision measurements. Atomic clocks have both practical (navigation, geodesy, and network synchronization) and fundamental applications. Additionally, advanced tools of computational atomic physics will be used to establish powerful constraints on postulated, but so-far undiscovered exotic interactions related to dark matter and dark forces. Such constraints are unique and at the same time complementary to those derived from particle colliders, such as LHC.\r\n\r\nThe  research will be carried out in Nevada, one of the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) states, underrepresented in the scientific enterprize.  This fulfills one of the strategic goals of the NSF to 'broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs'; research and education of a graduate student partially supported  with the goal of 'advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning'. The findings will be disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conference presentations, and the Internet.",
