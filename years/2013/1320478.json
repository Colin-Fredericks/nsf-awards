 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing is emerging as an attractive computing paradigm, where\r\nboth hardware and software resources can be leased from a cloud\r\nprovider to achieve better economy of scale, elasticity, availability,\r\nand flexibility for a plethora of services. A major challenge in\r\ndesigning such cloud platforms is in providing high and predictable\r\nperformance along with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. The\r\nperformance unpredictability is attributed to a myriad of factors\r\nincluding system scale, workload dynamism, virtualization overheads,\r\nresource sharing and contention.\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to investigate performance\r\nenhancement and performance quantification techniques in a cloud\r\nenvironment through three intertwined tasks.\r\nFirst, a comprehensive scheduling framework consisting of a high-level\r\njob scheduler and a fine-grained resource manager will be developed\r\nfor efficient management of cloud resources for performance enhancement.\r\nSecond, performance prediction models will be developed for estimating\r\njob completion time (JCT) in a cloud platform.\r\nThird, for providing QoS guarantees, a control-theoretic model\r\nincorporating the proposed scheduler and analytical models will be\r\ndeveloped. Measurements on real platforms with MapReduce \r\nand other representative cloud workloads will be used to validate the\r\nproposed ideas.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses one of the main concerns of cloud computing -\r\nWhat are the performance implications if my application is moved to a\r\ncloud? If successful in answering this question, it would have a tremendous\r\nimpact on the cloud-enabled application domains. The cross-cutting\r\nnature of this work can foster new research avenues.\r\nIn addition to undergraduate and graduate student training in areas\r\nsuch as architecture, distributed systems, and performance modeling,\r\nspecial attention will be given to involving women and minority\r\nstudents in this project. The modeling tools and techniques developed\r\nin this research will be made publicly available.\r\n",
