 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) encompasses exposures of Antarctic bedrock that provide a history of Antarctic continental evolution. The TAM also creates microhabitats for extremophiles and hosts unconsolidated sedimentary deposits that record the history of the ice sheet and Antarctica?s changing climate. Much less is known of the extant faunal and floral assemblages, climate, or geophysics of this region. The PI proposes a workshop to facilitate the gathering of multi disciplinary researchers to exchange ideas for investigating processes that are occurring or that have occurred in the TAM. This workshop will take place in September 2013 in Minneapolis and will be locally organized by Polar Geospatial Center.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nTAM researchers come from diverse fields in geoscience, atmospheric and climate science, glaciology, and ecology and evolutionary science. This workshop will encourage the participation of graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers and the organizing committee will strive to include a diverse group of participants.",
