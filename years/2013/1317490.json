 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between the University of Houston - Clear Lake (UHCL), an upper-level undergraduate and graduate university, and three campuses of the San Jacinto Community College district (SJC) to increase attainment of STEM associates and baccalaureate degrees, as well as to facilitate and increase transfer of STEM students across the institutions. The project focuses on increasing student engagement and persistence through the development of face-to-face and technology-enhanced learning networks, both within and across campuses. Supporting initiatives include extended orientation programs, peer and faculty mentoring, career-awareness and enhancement activities, and modest financial aid. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the strong partnership between the baccalaureate and associates institutions, well-designed and coherent project elements which build on literature-based best practices and successful pilot studies, clear implementation strategies, well-planned evaluation, and extensive involvement of local STEM industries. Broader impacts include enhanced support at these Hispanic-serving institutions, with additional efforts to reach women, veterans and/or low-income students. Project graduates deepen and diversify the local STEM workforce, and the project provides a useful model for linking associates and baccalaureate institutions, as well as local STEM employers, to support student retention and success.",

Our goals included: increasing the number of students graduating in STEM fields from each of the three campuses of SJC (a two-year college), facilitating and increasing transfer of STEM majors from SJC to UHCL, and increasing the number of students graduating in STEM fields from UHCL. We had proposed specific numerical goals for each of these sub-goals. All promised goals were met or exceeded expectations. We also intended to increase student engagement and persistence through the development of face-to-face and technology-enhanced learning communities in collaboration with local industry. The STEM fields we focused on included Computer Science (CS), Computer Engineering (CENG), Information Technology (ITEC), and Mathematics. Our supporting initiatives included an orientation during summer before the start of each fall semester, peer-mentoring and tutoring (both in-class and outside of class), development of a cyber-center website to archive and disseminate resources, monthly Tech Fridays, annual STEM challenge with participation and sponsorship from local industry, and modest financial aid supporting students in STEM majors.</p>\n<p>Assessment by the external evaluator of our project has shown that students who participated in these activities gained confidence to continue in their STEM education.
