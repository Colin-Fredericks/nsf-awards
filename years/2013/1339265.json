 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Maryland Baltimore County, in collaboration with the University of Maryland College Park, will develop and evaluate professional development activities focused on increasing the expertise of Maryland high school teachers for teaching computer science, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of rigorous computer science classes offered across the state and the number and diversity of students taking these classes.  Experienced higher education faculty and highly effective high school teachers will collaborate to train other high school teachers to develop and offer a college preparatory CS curriculum.  In the first year, an initial cohort of 12 master teachers will collaborate with the project leadership team to develop standardized classroom materials based on the CS Principles curriculum and then offer the CS Principles course in their home schools.  In the second year, the project staff will train less experienced teachers in the CS Principles curriculum, and in the third year, the leadership team will demonstrate scalability by supporting the delivery of multiple independently funded regional workshops.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop course materials, create training materials, and increase the expertise of high school computer science teachers in Maryland.  Master teachers and apprentice teachers will be trained in the new curriculum, increasing the readiness and ability of schools and teachers to adopt and offer the CS Principles curriculum and increasing the availability of academically rigorous CS courses in high schools across the state.  The proposed effort will ultimately lead to increased interest of Maryland students in studying and pursuing careers in computer science.",

The first goal was to create a community of practice (COP) among CS teachers in Maryland. Through the COP, teachers connect during professional development, at the annual computing education state summits, and through online interactions via Piazza. In fact, the Computer Science Teachers' Association (CSTA) Maryland chapter has steadily grown during the length of this project often having meetings aligned with the workshops to assist in recruiting active CSTA members. The second goal was to recruit and maintain cohorts of CS teachers who are highly effective educators and are well trained to deliver the Advanced Placement CS Principles (AP CSP) curriculum in an active learning classroom. Through this project, we have trained 73 Maryland teachers from across 24 local school systems and had a strong cohort of 15 master teachers who designed the curriculum and provided training as well as mentoring to the teachers. (See CS Matters Curriculum Development Team photo.) The CS teachers who benefitted from this project have enabled many more high schools to offer AP CSP. The third goal was to create a set of AP CSP course materials and teacher professional development training materials that enable the course to be taught throughout Maryland. The CS Matters curriculum is opened source and found on our website. (See http://csmatters.org/overview/ .) The curriculum and professional development materials are endorsed by the College Board. (See CS Matters Lesson image.) In addition to the in-depth training that we have provided in Maryland, we also provided free access to the materials for teachers and currently, have 257 teachers from across the world who have accessed our lessons.
