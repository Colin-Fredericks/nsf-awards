 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PIs will study the critical relationship between food resources provided by flowers and decisions made by pollinators on foraging.  Flowers attract pollinators by offering different food sources, pollen and nectar. Understanding how these floral rewards influence bee behavior is key for conserving ecologically and agriculturally important pollination mutualisms. Most previous research on floral rewards has focused on nectar, bees' source of carbohydrates. However, bees also consume pollen from many plant species, gaining the protein needed for egg production, larval development, and survival. While many plant species chemically or physically protect their pollen from consumption, 8-10% offer pollen itself as a reward. Collection of pollen rewards often requires a technique called sonication or \"buzz pollination.\" During sonication, bees rapidly contract their flight muscles, producing strong vibrations that forcibly expel pollen. \r\n\r\nThis study will reveal how the nutritional composition of floral rewards (e.g. carbohydrate/nectar vs. protein/pollen) influence individual bees, propensity to specialize on flower types. Such specialization is critical to plant reproductive success because it transfers pollen to conspecifics. Further, given evidence that nutritional factors contribute to pollinator declines, it is important to understand how bees specialize on particular nutrients in relation to colony needs. Yet, little is known about how bees' propensity to specialize depends upon whether a flower offers only nectar, only pollen, or both. Further, it is unknown whether energetically expensive collection routines, such as sonication, influence specialization. Behavioral experiments will help understand how reward composition and handling costs affect bee and plant fitness. Untangling the connections between bumble bees' nutritional state, floral morphology, and reward composition will provide a better understanding of the foraging patterns of these native, economically important pollinator species, widely in decline. The research will involve outreach including a native bee identification workshop and web resource developed in parallel will promote understanding of these questions both within and beyond the scientific community. Many economically important crops, such as tomatoes, eggplants, blueberries, and kiwifruit are buzz pollinated by native bees.",

Despite the economic and ecological value of these interactions, we know surprisingly little about how they are driven by bees&rsquo; nutritional needs. For example, while the composition of floral rewards varies widely across plant species, little was known about how bees make the decision to collect these different resources, or how they evaluate the composition of a given plant&rsquo;s rewards. This project not only uncovered findings useful for understanding how bees might respond to changes to their foraging landscape that have been implicated in their recent declines, but more generally, the project yielded insights relevant to understanding how any animal might forage for multiple resources. The latter is a question that has been largely neglected by traditional models of foraging behavior.</p>\n<p>Namely, the project discovered that bees taste the pollen they collect, and can learn to associate multiple floral traits with its presence. In considering how bees forage for two resources (nectar, their source of carbohydrates, and pollen, their source of protein and lipids) experiments using floral surrogates showed that bees can &ldquo;multi-task&rdquo;, learning which flowers they encounter offer each resource.&nbsp; Studies that asked for the first time how collecting both resources impacts forging performance revealed unexpectedly complex interactions: depending on circumstance and chemical composition, a given reward can enhance or impair learning about the second. This finding has opened up several new lines of research that take a new look at bee learning and memory (a longstanding model system in the field of neuroethology) from the perspective of chemically complex floral rewards.</p>\n<p>Complementary research examined pollen and nectar foraging by bees on live flowers, rather than artificial surrogates. A series of studies expanded our knowledge of a specialized interaction in which bees collect pollen through substrate-borne sonication. This flower handling strategy is associated with a number of familiar agricultural crops, including tomato and blueberry. The project demonstrated that, while sonication itself was observed to be strongly innate, sonicating bees readily adopt a preference for species (or morphs within a species) from which pollen is successfully collected and that such learning involves long-term memory. Cues associated with multiple floral parts are learned, with anther cues being demonstrated to be at least partly chemical in nature. It was additionally shown that bees flexibly alternate sonication with another collection mechanism, called scrabbling, in ways that appear to maximize pollen collected and minimize energy expended.</p>\n<p>Along the way, the project involved two postdoctoral researchers, four graduate students, a visiting graduate student, and dozens of undergraduate researchers, many of whom were members of groups underrepresented in science or first-generation college students. Numerous undergraduate theses were completed on this project, and trainees supported by the grant went on to win regional and national awards and fellowships for work associated with the project. Development of a new hands-on lab for an undergraduate course led to a research breakthrough: personnel developed a novel method for studying bee learning in the field, which will allow future researchers to study cognition in wild bees and vastly expand the taxonomic breadth of work on bee learning. Findings were shared broadly via a STEAM collaboration that let to an art exhibit and associated curricular resources inspired by the project. Each year, members of the Tucson and Reno communities learned about findings through pollinator-themed festivals as well as national media coverage (e.g. <em>New York Times</em>, PBS Science, <em>Scientific American</em>).
