 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will examine to what extent tectonic fractures modify the rates and styles of landscape evolution.  These fractures are typically associated with the movement of tectonic plates, the faulting of rocks, and/or the eruption of volcanoes.  Scientists have known since 1875 that these fractures influence how valleys deepen and widen over time, but what remains uncertain is how important the fractures are.  What, for example, is the effect of a doubling in the bedrock fracture concentration on valley evolution?  The doctoral student will examine two valleys, the Tuolumne Meadows of Yosemite National Park and the Mono Recesses of the Sierra National Forest.  These valleys are similar in most respects, such as rock type, climate, and glacial history, but they are fundamentally different in their fracture concentration and style.  The doctoral student will quantify the importance of tectonic fractures to landscape evolution in order to assess the effects of fracture concentration, orientation, and distribution for both of these distinct fracture styles.\r\n\r\nThis research project will contribute to enhanced understanding of how the surface of the Earth changes with time, and it will help refine numerical models to more realistically represent that evolution.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for five undergraduate students who are working with the doctoral student.  Information about the project and its results will be presented through public outreach in Yosemite National Park and the John Muir Wilderness.  The project should yield practical benefits by assisting those engaged in modeling the evolution of specific landscapes over long periods of time, with special implications for geological engineering and hydrogeology.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded the dissertation research of Richard Becker.  The goal of his research is to determine how important fractures in the bedrock are to rates of glacial erosion.  We have known since the mid- to late-1800's that more fractured bedrock is more erodible, but how much more?  Despite their widely recognized importance, bedrock fractures are routinely ignored in computer models of landscape evolution, in part because the strength of their influence remains unquantified.\n\nTo address this issue, Richard Becker and his Ph.D. advisor, Basil Tikoff, identified two drainage basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California that form a \"natural experiment\" for isolating the influence of bedrock fracture concentrations on rates of glacial erosion.  These two landscapes were the Tuolumne Meadows area of Yosemite National Park and the Mono Recesses in the Sierra National Forest.  Approximately 35 miles apart, these landscapes are etched into nearly identical granites, have experienced nearly identical uplift histories, and occupy similar positions in the overall mountain range.  Both drainages abut the western crest of the range and span elevations between approximately 8,000 and 13,000 feet.  Critically, however, the Tuolumne Meadows landscape contains zones of highly fractured bedrock.  These zones are set within what is otherwise very resistant and unfractured bedrock.  In contrast, the Mono Recesses are uniformly, and moderately, fractured.  \n\nBeryllium-10 is a rare isotope that acculumates at known rates in the upper 6-10 feet of the bedrock as a result of the collision of extraterresterial particles with Earth's surface.  As erosion removes overlying rock and a potential sample enters the upper 6-10 feet of the Earth's crust, 10Be begins to accumulate.  The concentration of 10Be in a rock at the surface reflects how long it took to travel that distance of 6-10 feet.  Thus, more 10Be means lower erosion rates.  In this study, we focused our 10Be sampling on the Mono Recesses because previous researchers had already measured 10Be concentrations in the Tuolumne Meadows region.  Our goal was to complete the comparison.\n\nBased on our study, the last ice age removed more than 6 to 10 feet of bedrock from all portions of the Mono Recesses landscape.  In contrast, the previous work in the Tuolumne Meadows area clearly indicates that less than 6 to 10 feet were removed from sparsely fractured locations, despite being covered by glacial ice for thousands of years.  Preliminary estimates suggest that more than 60% of the variability in glacial erosion can be explained by the concentration of bedrock fractures.  Also, that there is a power law relationship between fracture concentration and glacial erosion rate.  As fracture concentration increases, the incremental increase in the erosion rate decreases.  This result suggests that there may be a point at which the bedrock is effectively saturated with fractures and they cease to be the limiting factor for the removal of bedrock.\n\nRichard Becker presented some aspects of this research at two public lectures in Yosemite National Park.  He spoke on approximately 80 people at two different lectures in August 2014.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard A Becker"
