The proposed scoping meeting will provide the foundation for a new series of activities to address systematically the implications of these tools and technologies in the changing nature of the life sciences. The understanding gained from these activities will in turn have important implications for how life sciences research is best organized, conducted, and supported. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of the proposed meeting is of significant interest to NSF, particularly to the Divisions of CBET and MCB, as it will help in developing funding strategies for future developments in life sciences and its derived biotechnologies.  Therefore, the meeting will be co-funded by both divisions.",
