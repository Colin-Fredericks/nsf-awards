 "awd_abstract_narration": "The implementation of structural polymers and fiber reinforced polymer composites in civil infrastructure, energy, aerospace, and automotive industries has been steadily gaining prominence.  Epoxy resins are dominant materials used in structural applications due to their strength and stiffness.  However, epoxy resins are also brittle and essentially elastic up to failure with little capacity for redistribution of stresses and dissipation of energy.  The objective of this project is to develop tough epoxy resins through the synthesis and characterization of novel interpenetrating networks of traditional epoxy resins with polydicyclopentadiene, a commercially available polymer that is well-known to be ductile and tough. The hypothesis of this project is that an interpenetrating network will combine the advantageous properties of both of its constituents thereby exhibiting superior cracking and debonding behavior as compared to traditional structural epoxy resins.  The knowledge gained in the development of these materials will provide a greater understanding of critical parameters governing interpenetrating network formation, structural evolution during the material preparation, and relationships between the material structure and macroscopic physical properties. \r\n\r\nAs engineers become more comfortable with the use of composites in structural applications, they are adopting thicker and larger structural components to meet the load requirements of more demanding applications. For example, some modern commercial airliners implement fiber reinforced polymer composites; similarly, glass fiber composites are commonly used to fabricate wind turbine blades. In civil infrastructure, thick, high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymers have been investigated to repair and strengthen deteriorated steel structures. Despite their higher costs, epoxy resin adhesives are most commonly used to bond composite materials for structural applications. This research project will result in development of a new class of materials that maintain the advantageous properties of epoxy resins (high strength and stiffness), yet are also tough and resistant to fracturing. Educational programs will be closely integrated into the research objectives, including the development of a hands-on outreach program for K-12 students and participation of undergraduate and graduate students in the research, emphasizing retaining students in engineering and educating students on the impact of polymers on society.\r\n",
