 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Web browser is one of the most frequently used application by most people to perform common tasks such as shopping, social networking, emailing, banking, finding directions, and research on the Internet. Security threats and attacks targeting browsers or browser-based applications are becoming sophisticated as attackers are constantly developing innovative ways to exploit vulnerabilities of browsers and browser-based applications. Researchers, though, are making positive progress in mitigating risks from browsers to defend enterprise systems and consumer devices. Therefore, it is imperative to bring research results on browser security into education and integrate them into the existing IA curricula. This project aims to (1) use typical topics in browser security as the basis for transferable teaching objects containing lecture slides, lecture videos, hands-on labs, quizzes, interactive visualization tools, and case studies for adoption in many education settings; (2) integrate the developed teaching objects in browser security into the existing curricula in three participating institutes: Syracuse University, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University; and (3) conduct faculty development workshops to disseminate the teaching objects and build partnerships among institutions. The broader impacts of this project include strengthened partnership and enhanced IA curricula among the participating institutions as well as institutions from across the nation, and improved IA research and education opportunities for minorities and females.",

The project has transited research on browser security into transferable teaching objects with the purpose of improving student learning in cybersecurity. Research topics in browser and web security have been customized and transited into hands-on labs, interactive visualization tools, and case studies so that they were adopted in many education settings. Lecture videos were developed to help instructors and students to understand key concepts. Hands-on labs and case studies were also developed to engage students with real-world situations and build skills in developing secure browser and browser-based applications. Interactive visualization were developed to make complex and abstract concepts and attacks visible. The developed teaching materials from research outcomes have enhanced curricula at Syracuse University, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), and North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NC A&amp;T). We will also focus on faculty development and dissemination through a faculty workshop and aim to build collaboration and partnership that will connection faculty in multiple institutions. This project also disseminated outcomes of the research and development through paper publication, conference presentation, and a faculty summer workshop which helped faculty from many diverse universities to enhance their cybersecurity instruction using visualization tools, hands-on labs, and case studies. The workshop impacted more than twenty (20) faculty members from more than twenty (20) institutions. This project was able to connect with a broader group of educators with similar background and interests in cybersecurity education which enhanced the knowledge base on how to improve student learning in cybersecurity more effectively. This project has improved curricula, student learning, and faculty collaboration and development at three institutions in three states: New York, Tennessee, and North Carolina. This project has also broadened participations of minority students in cybersecurity training because the NC A&amp;T is a leader in minority education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Li&nbsp;Yang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
