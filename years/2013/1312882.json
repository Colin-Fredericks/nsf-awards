One of the main goals is to improve the accuracy of stellar ages using stellar rotation  techniques(gyrochronology), which has applications to other fields of stellar astronomy. This work will be used to constrain planet formation models in open star clusters.    \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include making the data publicly available and training undergraduate students in research, including experience with reduction and analysis of stellar spectra for stellar properties, radial-velocities, and binary star orbits, and with time-series photometric data for transiting planets and stellar variability(rotation).",
