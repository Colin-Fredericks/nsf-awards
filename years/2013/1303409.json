Additionally, students are participating in the Hampton University annual Information Assurance Symposium and the annual Association of Computer/Information Sciences and Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) Symposium. HU works with its partners, Spelman College, Winston Salem State University, Elizabeth State University and other HBCU institutions, to recruit highly-qualified computing students with interest in cybersecurity into HU GETS-IA program.",

This CyberCorps: SFS: Hampton University Graduate Education and Training Scholarship in Information Assurance (HU GETS-IA) Program allowed Hampton University to continue to produce highly skilled cybersecurity workers and address the lack of students (particularly from underrepresented communities) that are pursuing graduate degrees. The goal of the scholarship program was to support the development of cybersecurity professionals, both undergraduate and graduate levels at the Information Assurance and Cyber Security Center at Hampton University (IAC@HU). The IAC@HU is a designated National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE).&nbsp; The SFS program funded projects that address cybersecurity education and workforce development, including funding to award scholarships to students in cybersecurity.&nbsp; Over the past 7 years, we offered the scholarship to 14 students (6 females and 8 males). The program has a 100% placement in both summer internships and full-time employment. Seven students have graduated with both a BS degree and MS in Information Assurance (IA), six (6) students have graduated with their MS in IA, and one (1) with a BS degree. Upon graduation, 100% of SFS scholars have secured their full-time employment including NSA, NGA, DHS, DISA, CISA, US Army, US Navy, SPAWAR, MITRE, and City of&nbsp; Philadelphia (86% Executive Federal, 6% STTL, and 6%FFRDC). Our SFS scholars completed their internship at NSA, DHS, DSS, NPPD, ICE, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, MITRE, and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.&nbsp; All SFS scholars participated in cybersecurity competitions, cyber-security research projects and for the past 7 years produced 1 journal paper, 24 conference proceeding papers (3 of 24 were international conferences), 8 oral presentations (only abstracts), and 8 poster presentations (only abstracts). The project received a renewal award to continue scholarship for services for MS in IA (now called MS in Cyber Security) and also to expand to include only the BS program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/31/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chutima&nbsp;Boonthum</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1303409/1303409_10225588_1622516785842_SFSFair2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1303409/1303409_10225588_1622516785842_SFSFair2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 HU SFS with Sen.
