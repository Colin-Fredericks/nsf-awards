 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is responding to a need to assess the value of student-focused \"Out of School Time\" (OST) science programs.  The number of these programs has risen substantially and there is increased interest in the value of such programs. Three instruments that will allow implementers to assess the effectiveness of their programs are being developed. These instruments are: (1) participant survey, (2) observational protocol, and (3) program analysis protocol.   Applying the logic underlying the theoretical approach and instrument development in career/occupational counseling, the project is addressing four issues.  The project draws on a theoretical framework to inform the development and integration of instruments that assess OST science programs.  In addition, the project modifies single subject research designs to observe and document more than one subject during an observational cycle of student engagement in OST programming.  By working with users of evaluation in the scientific and engineering research community, the project addresses the need for practitioner-oriented instruments that can be implemented by practitioners and have high reliability, validity, and quality control across observations and sites.  The project is a collaboration among the principle investigator and principal investigators and Directors of Education and Outreach of research centers supported by the Materials Research in Science and Engineering Centers Program, a program administered by the NSF Research and Research Activities Directorates.",
