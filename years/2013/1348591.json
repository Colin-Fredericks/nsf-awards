 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant provides funding for feasibility studies for the laser manufacturing of 3D silicon photonic crystals for large area solar cells. Both electrodynamic computations and experiments will be performed to explore the feasibility of nanophotonic light trapping in 3D photonic crystal photoactive regions for enhanced efficiencies in solar cells. A scalable laser manufacturing method will be developed to demonstrate preliminary results on low-cost 3D silicon photonic structures. The proposed process involves the use of laser interference lithography, chemical vapor deposition and template infiltration. This process has been simulated but not yet demonstrated for 3D silicon crystals.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will demonstrate the proof-of-concept for a new photonic crystal solar cell structure that exhibits enhanced efficiencies and that can be manufactured at production scale and low cost. The long term goal of the research effort is to determine process-structure-property relationships for the optical absorption of laser manufactured 3D photonic crystals. The preliminary data generated here will serve as the foundation for a future study.",
