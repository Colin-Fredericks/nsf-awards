Drawing on sociological insights about social construction, this research focuses on how the race and gender of the perpetrator relate to the way in which events are presented, perhaps differently, in media coverage and criminal justice responses to these cases. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, including both quantitative and qualitative techniques, to analyze data from newspaper articles and court transcripts. \r\n\t\r\nThe proposed research will improve understanding of the apparent resilience of ideologies by articulating how ideas about gender are integrated into social institutions through the actions and beliefs of individuals. Specifically, the research will establish the extent to which these cases serve as opportunities for individuals to expand and transform dominant ideas about gender or adhere to normal expectations. Second, by focusing on incidents in which constructions of the case vary, this research will demonstrate how dominant ideas about gender are strategically employed by varying actors to serve their interests. By examining legal and media settings, the research will reveal how strategies for constructing the events vary by institutional setting. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis research has the potential to contribute to broader society in a number of ways.  Recent research on the frequency of responses to and consequences of teacher misconduct suggest broad interest and concern over these types of incidents. This project will contribute new information about a large sample of these types of cases and will add to this scholarly dialogue in a way that can assist policy makers and educational administrators in developing more targeted prevention, disclosure, and response procedures in U.S. schools. The research will also provide an empirically based critique of the tendency to ignore or minimize the victim status of male victims of female teacher misconduct. This has the potential to draw greater attention and support to this under-served population.",

Statistical analysis of the sentencing outcomes of the sample of cases provided support for the &ldquo;selective chivalry thesis,&rdquo; a well-known and contested concept in criminology.

An analysis of the amount and content of news media coverage of these cases, I found that there was a markedly greater amount of coverage of cases involving white female defendants than male defendants and female defendants of other races. This high level of media coverage was especially noteworthy because members of the media often expressed moral outrage at the female offenders while simultaneously trivializing the teenage male victim&rsquo;s experiences of sexual victimhood. This finding adds to a growing body of literature which suggests that male victims of sexual abuse experience greater difficulty in identifying themselves as sexual victims because of the lack of existing cultural and ideological resources available for responding to male sexual victimhood.
