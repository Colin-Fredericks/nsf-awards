 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the Professional Development Program (PDP), run by the Institute for Scientist & Engineer Educators. The PDP trains graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to teach effectively and inclusively as a complement to their research training, and simultaneously seeks to retain undergraduates in the STEM pipeline. The work will facilitate the expansion of the PDP to a nationwide level from its traditional Hawai?i-based roots, allowing teams of 3-4 at any US institution to apply for and participate in the program. This will help address numerous outstanding shortcomings in the astronomy workforce and educational pipeline. \r\n\r\nThis project will diversify and improve the astronomy-related workforce at multiple levels of degree/training and experience. The team will (1) develop the teaching, mentoring, and professional skills of graduate students and postdocs in astronomy; (2) develop the teaching, mentoring, and professional skills of current astronomy professionals with a focus on Hawai?i; and (3) advance undergraduates in STEM with a focus on broadening participation. The PDP will have a strong synergy with the Akamai Workforce Initiative, and the two programs will jointly address critical Hawai?ian workforce needs that are highly relevant to the forthcoming Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).",
