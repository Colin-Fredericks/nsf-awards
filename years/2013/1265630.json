 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tom G. Driver of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago will explore the design and execution of modular, efficient syntheses of N-heteroaromatic materials from vinyl azides using their rhodium(II)-catalyzed C-H bond amination reaction.  The targeted dipyrrolothiophenes and N-heterocyclic heptacenes are two classes of low molecular weight N-heterocycles that exhibit promising properties in thin film organic field effect transistors.  By making rational changes to both the N-substituent and aromatic groups, the relationship between the molecular structure and bulk physical properties of their N-heteroaromatic materials will be determined to allow the properties of thin film organic field effect transistors to be tuned.\r\n\r\nAchievement of the research goals might change the synthetic strategies used for the construction of N-heteroaromatic materials.  From readily available starting materials, C-H bond functionalization efficiently establishes the N-heterocyclic core and produces an N-H bond that enables easy modification of the solubility of the material.  By examining the properties of the proposed N-heteroaromatic materials, fundamental insight into the relationship between the molecular structure and bulk physical properties of these materials will be gained.  The knowledge gained by these studies is anticipated to enable the rational design of materials with predictable bulk properties to advance high performance printable organic electronics.  In addition, this project will serve as a fertile ground for the training of students to advance in their scientific careers.  By emphasizing the participation of female and underrepresented minority students, this program will help meet the goals outlined by President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to transform and charge the STEM-student pipeline.",

First, a series of novel highly soluble bispyrrolothiophenes were synthesized from vinyl azides using transition metal-catalyzed C&ndash;H bond functionalization.

Our investigations identified that the optical properties and oxidation potential of our compounds were dominated by the pyrrolothiophene unit with a &lambda;max at ~400 nm and oxidation occurring at ~1 V.  FET devices constructed with thin films of these bispyrrolothiophenes were also fabricated via thin-film solution processing.  One of these compounds, a bispyrrolothiophene linked with benzothiodiazole exhibits a mobility of ~ 0.3 cm2/(V s) and an Ion/Ioff of &gt;106.  Second, new benzobisoxazole cruciforms that contain bispyrrolothiophene on the electron-rich axis were synthesized from vinyl azides for the first time.  The optical spectroscopy of these cruciforms depended on the identity of acetylenic arenes, and when pyridines were placed on the electron-deficient y-axis, the resulting cruciform was found to be a selective and sensitive zinc sensor. Third, a series of &alpha;-fused oligoheteroacenes containing the indolothiophene structural motif were also synthesized using our Rh2(II)-catalyzed C&ndash;H bond amination reaction to construct the thiophene&ndash;N bond.  Analysis of the resulting acenes by cyclic voltammetry revealed that the position of the HOMO could be modified through substitution on the indolo-fragment.  While the identity of the nitrogen substituent did not affect the electronic nature of the material, it did change the packing of the crystal lattice.  These results support that simple azides can be transformed into complex N-heterocyclic materials and that systematic variation of their structure enables the rational design of materials with predictable bulk properties.\n\n \n\nBecause of the prevalence of N-heterocycles in compounds that exhibit promising electronic properties, we also developed efficient methods to construct these important scaffolds from ortho-substituted aryl azides.  Our methods were aimed at (1) improving the step-economy of the substrate synthesis and (2) exploiting the reactivity of the electrophilic rhodium N-aryl catalytic intermediate to access complex 3H- and 2H-indoles. Together these new methods improve the efficiency of N-heterocycle synthesis to enable the construction of complex N-heteroarene scaffolds as potential electronic materials.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact.  This project has provided training in synthetic organic chemistry for six graduate students, five undergraduate students and three high school students.  Of the six graduate students involved in this project, two are women and one of the female graduate students is African-American.  The latter graduate student graduated with her PhD in the Fall of 2015, and is currently pursuing her postdoctoral research studies at the Air Force National Laboratory in Dayton, OH as an NRC Fellow.  Of the five undergraduates who participate on this project, two are African-Americans&mdash;one male and one female.  Two of the three high school students involved in this project are female.
