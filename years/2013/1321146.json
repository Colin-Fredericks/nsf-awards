 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to determine how turn-taking in human-human dialogue works, and use this as a basis for developing a flexible model of turn-taking for use in spoken dialogue systems. The first two aims focus on determining whether turn-taking is solely determined by the current speaker or is negotiated by both conversants. The first aim measures how well human subjects, listening to excerpts of speech, can predict whether the current speaker will continue the turn or release it. The second aim analyzes timing lags at turn transitions. Many turn transitions have short lags, which favors a speaker-control model; however this might be an artifact of common speech act sequences, back channels, early onsets, and provisional turns. The third aim, using the findings of the first two aims, is to determine the cues and mechanisms that are used by conversants in taking the turn.\r\n\r\nBetter understanding of turn-taking in human-human dialogues is important as it will help in building more efficient and natural spoken dialogue systems, allowing the user and system to better collaborate to solve complex tasks. It should also allow spoken dialogue systems to deal with a broad range of users, from experts to novices: for experts, letting them take the initiative (and the turn), in order to efficiently complete the task, while guiding novices with more directions and examples. Furthermore, understanding human-human turn-taking might have biomedical applications. For example, Autism, which is a disorder that affects social communication, might impact how people engage in turn-taking, and so turn-taking biomarkers might help in diagnosing it.",

In our research, we focused on understanding the amount of control that the current speaker has in determining who will speak next (speaker control model), versus how much this control might be shared with the other conversant (collaborative model). Better understanding how people naturally engage in turn-taking will allow us to build spoken dialogue systems that are more naturally and efficient to use.\n\nPerceptual Study\n\nThe first part of this work examined whether someone listening to an utterance (or sentence) that was part of a recorded conversation can predict who will speak next: whether the current speaker will continue, or there is a switch to the other conversant.  If participants are able to correctly guess then this must mean that the current speaker dictates who will speak next, and that the information is coded on the current utterance.\n\nWe also examined whether there was strong agreement between the participants.  Of the 40 utterances, 17 had strong agreement as to who will speak next, at levels well beyond chance and statistical significance.  This is consistent with the collaborative model, in which the current speaker might not always indicate who should speak next.   Of the 17, 12 were predicted to be continues; however, only 7 actually were. This shows that even when the current speaker signals they want to continue, this can be overruled by the other conversant.\n\nThe other 5 were predicted to be switches, and all were switches.  However, 4 of the 5 were question types.  As questions are such an efficient way for the current speaker to signal the other to take the turn, other signals might not be used much.  \n\nEmpirical Study of Turn-Taking Offsets\n\nWe then examined the distribution of offsets from turn switches (how long it took for the next person to start speaking).  Key to this grant was to juxtapose this with the distribution of offsets from turn continues, pauses between turn-taking units of the same speaker.  This way, we can start to examine whether turn-taking has a collaborative aspect to it, rather than being dictated by the current speaker.  We found that the distribution of turn-taking offsets are quite similar between the two, with the exception that switches have some negative offsets.\n\nPast work in analyzing the offsets used silences of at least 200ms to segment speech into units, which can be done automatically. In our work, we had people annotate the speech and segment it at places where it forms a complete thought, as well as where it did not seem rude for the other to start speaking.

In some cases the next speech may come quickly, perhaps because the response is a simple backchannel or the speaker is continuing on. In other cases the speech may take a while, perhaps because it takes longer to think of a contribution that will advance the dialogue.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis work supported a Post-doc, Master's student, and an undergraduate student, teaching them how to conduct research work, and giving them an in-depth understanding of the how turn-taking works.  A richer understanding of turn-taking in typical development might allow us to better understand how this aspect of dialogue coordination is affected in Autism, which could lead to better diagnosis and remediation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Heeman"
