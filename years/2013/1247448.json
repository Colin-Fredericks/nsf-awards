 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Innovation Research Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the Raman Force Microscope (RFM) to provide a new metrology tool for in situ topographic, strain, and chemical analysis with nanometer spatial resolution.  Feature size reduction in the semiconductor industry requires that metrology methods must routinely measure properties down to the atomic scale.  Novel materials and geometries add to the complexity of measurements. RFM technology is a combination of Raman microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), where an AFM tip provides a nanometer scale light source to generate stimulated Raman scattering, and at the same time measures the force gradient arising from the Raman scattering. The use of the AFM tip as the Raman scattering detector significantly simplifies Raman signal acquisition and system configuration.  By combining a high-speed AFM scheme, this technology allows for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment, i.e. stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization defects. The objectives of the proposed Phase I study are (1) to demonstrate reflection mode RFM for Raman signal measurement of Si wafers and (2) to demonstrate measurement of stress-induced Raman shifts in nanometer-sized features.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the semiconductor industry but across many disciplines and industries, both in academia and industry.  RFM can be used to measure and characterize a wide variety of nanoscale materials and structures, e.g. high- and low-k dielectric films and other emerging materials (such as graphene) used in advanced semiconductor processes. It can be also widely used across disciplines, e.g. for the measurement of nanoparticle homogeneity or optimization of self-assembled monolayers in surface chemistry. The RFM technique also has the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research.  A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.  The RFM technique will be simpler to implement as compared to other hybrid instruments involving high resolution microscopy, resulting in an affordable instrument for academic and research institutions.",

An atomic force microscope (AFM) has the means to hold a sharp tip (tip radius  ~ millionth of an inch) in close proximity (at specified gap spacing) of a sample surface. By raster scanning the tip (or sample) while recording the height position of the tip required to maintain the same gap spacing, the AFM produces a map of the sample surface topography.  AFM maintains the constant gap spacing by measuring and keeping constant the force that exists between the tip and the sample.  \nWhile AFM has found widespread use among engineers and scientists by providing them with nano-scale topography information, a major limitation is its inability to provide chemical information about the sample.  The best way to probe the chemical nature of a sample is by interrogating its \"color\"; one can analyze the spectrum of the light reflected from or transmitted through the sample to learn the chemical makeup of the sample.  The wavelength that is absorbed tells what material the sample is made of.  The limitation of this light-based interrogation is the tightest focus a given wavelength of light can achieve, which is referred to as the diffraction limit.  For visible light, the diffraction limit is about 0.3 microns (roughly one hundred thousandth of an inch).  While small by macroscopic standards, 0.3 micron spot size still contains millions of individual molecules, preventing us from resolving the color of individual molecules.\nWhen a focused light is directed to the gap region between an AFM tip and sample surface, the light will scatter from a region at least as large as the diffraction limit.  Mixed in the scattered light will be a miniscule amount of light that scattered from the apex of the tip to the sample surface, bounced back up to the tip apex, and then scattered back to the detector; this portion is referred to as near-field scattering.  This near-field scattered light, originating from the sample region directly beneath the tip, contains the \"color\" information of the region with a lateral dimension of about 0.02 microns (size of the typical tip apex), thereby breaking the diffraction limit.  This type of instrument where optical scattering is combined with AFM is called scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM).  It requires sophisticated methods and advanced photonics instrumentation to retrieve the miniscule near-field scattered light of interest from all the other scattered light.\nOur instrument, called a Resonance Force Microscope (RFM), uses a novel method to measure the same high resolution color information without the need for collecting light. It turns out that when there is near-field scattering as described above, it creates a corresponding force between the tip and the sample which is proportional to the amount of near-field scattering.  Our instrument can measure the standard AFM force between a tip and sample in one channel and the force change due to the near-field scattering in another channel, allowing it to simultaneously trace out the three-dimensional shape of the surface and also see it in \"color\" at a truly nanoscale resolution.  As mentioned before, there is no need for complex optics and expensive electronics to collect light, making our RFM much simpler to operate than other instruments. Optics-based instruments also require different optics depending upon the color of light being collected, but since the RFM sees color as a force, it requires no change to the instrumen..."
