Due to its complete miscibility in water, ethanol may become mixed in the water body in high concentrations.  The physics of this mixing process are complex and appear to be influenced by the production of heat and variations in interfacial tension and viscosity.  This research will elucidate the physics of mixing of biofuels in surface water by conducting experiments to measure the rate of mixing and entrainment in a multiphase system using DPIT (digital particle image thermometry) and DPIV (digital particle image velocimetry).  The goal is develop a correlation between the degree of mixing and the relevant nondimensional parameters.  The high concentrations of ethanol may solubilize hazardous compounds such as benzene from gasoline into the water column.  Due to the high organic compound loading in the water column, pesticides historically present in sediment may desorb and be re-suspended in the water column.  This study will evaluate the enhancement of desorption of organochlorine pesticides from sediment that may occur in the presence of ethanol and gasoline mixtures due to cosolvency effects as well as due to possible changes in the structure in sediment organic matter.  The goal is to quantify the degree of desorption as a function of the composition of the mixtures of water, ethanol and gasoline, and the properties of the sediment.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to promote ethanol/gasoline blends as an alternative fuel, potentially major negative impacts on the environment have been overlooked.  The assumption is the environmental impact of biofuels on surface water is negligible as \"ethanol is biodegradable.\"  Yet, large fish kills attributable to ethanol spills have already been documented.  The models used for predicting concentrations of ethanol in rivers do not reflect the actual process of mixing.  This research will examine the physics of mixing of ethanol/gasoline blends in water to help develop more accurate methods for predicting ethanol concentrations in rivers.  Due to their solubility in ethanol, hazardous compounds present in gasoline may be solubilized in higher concentrations in a river.  With a high organic contaminant concentration in the water column, pesticides historically present in sediment may desorb and be re-suspended, thus increasing their mobility.  The information provided by this study will aid in the determination of the magnitude of the environmental risk posed by spills of ethanol/gasoline blends in surface waters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn order to meet renewable energy mandates, the use of ethanol-blended fuels has increased dramatically.  Since the majority of ethanol is produced in the Midwest and then transported to the coasts in tanker trucks, by railroad and on barges, the possibility of spills exists.  In fact, with the increased consumption of biofuels, the rate of ethanol spills has grown to the point where one occurs every two days on average.  The coincidence of ethanol spills and high pesticide usage in agricultural watersheds raises the concern that ethanol might enhance the concentration of regulated organochlorine pesticides in surface waters. \n\n We found that the mixing process following a spill is highly non-linear and produces large vortices that can reach very deep in the water column as far as the bottom sediment layer.  Once present in the water column, ethanol can increase the aqueous solubility of the organochlorine pesticides, dieldrin, lindane, and chlorpyrifos by three to seven orders of magnitude, as the ethanol mass fraction increased from 0.0 to 1.0.  In the presence of gasoline, the ethanol reduces the partition coefficient, resulting in an increased concentration in water.  The presence of organic matter from the sediment further enhances the solubility of organochlorine pesticides, above that observed in the presence of ethanol.  Both the composition and concentration of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) are important, with DOM extracted from contaminated river sediments having a relatively greater effect.    \n\n \n\nThis project suggests that surface water quality may be impacted by spills of ethanol-based biofuels into surface waters.  Such information is critical to informing the national conversation on environmental costs of alternative fuels and to developing appropriate spill response strategies. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aline Cotel"
