 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research advances the knowledge and capability for securely\r\nperforming general-purpose computation and communication on zero-power\r\ndevices that rely on harvested energy stored in extremely small\r\nreservoirs such as capacitors.  A type of zero-power device,\r\ncomputational RFIDs (CRFIDs) harvest RF energy and endure continual\r\ninterruptions to power.  Complete loss of RAM on the order of every\r\nsecond makes the notion of a computational checkpoint fundamental to\r\nthis model of computing.  A significant problem is how to perform\r\neffective computation and checkpoints in a secure and\r\nprivacy-preserving manner.  The most fundamental question is: how to\r\nsecurely make forward progress of computation on zero-power devices?\r\nThe exploration of checkpointing strategies that exploit the\r\nenergy-centric properties of computational RFIDs will lay a solid\r\nfoundation for designing secure software and systems for pervasive\r\ndevices.  Beyond security and privacy, the research seeks to discover\r\nwhat kinds of computational problems can be solved in a practical\r\nsense on extremely resource-constrained devices.  While the\r\nexperiments focus on computational RFIDs, many of the techniques will\r\napply broadly to devices with batteries as well.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this work will lead to improved security for computation\r\nin low-power, untrusted infrastructure.  The expected results will be\r\npublished in venues at the intersection of security & privacy and\r\nlow-power computation.  Potential applications include improved\r\nsecurity and privacy for (1) implantable medical devices and (2)\r\nsensors embedded in concrete components of bridges and roads.\r\n",
