 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to explore phase transition and self-organization in large population dynamic systems.  The thrust of the methodological work is at the intersection of the dynamical systems theory and game theory.  The application focus is on investigating plasticity in the thalamocortical neuronal network in brain.  The research will develop methods that are general enough to apply for mean-field games and that can be exploited in diverse applications.  The research approach progresses from development of theoretical tools to their specialized application to thalamocortical network modeling. Deliverables include methods and computational tools to investigate phase transitions and stability in coupled oscillator models; algorithms for adaptation in such models; and applications of these tools to reduced order modeling of thalamocortical networks; and to development of specialized network adaptation schemes for plasticity therein.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research can lead to fundamental advances in our understanding of the emergence of complex behavior in a large population of dynamically interacting agents.  For biological systems, this methodology offers new organizing principles to address longstanding questions concerning collective emergent behavior in terms of generalizations of game theoretic concepts.  A specific research outcome concerns mechanisms for plasticity (learning) in neuronal networks.   This project has put together several educational initiatives to help disseminate the methods, outcomes, and the interdisciplinary synergies. This project seeks to develop and maintain strong undergraduate involvement in research, interdisciplinary outreach activities, exposure of the engineering undergraduates to the central role of dynamics and control in applications, and foster symbiotic relationship between neuroscience and engineering.",

Prominent among these is the application of game theory to obtain economic equilibria based on rational actions of self-interested individuals. These equilibria may not be ideal: Even when the behavior of individuals is entirely rational from the individual's perspective, the resulting collective behavior in the marketplace may be catastrophic.  This is referred to as \"rational irrationality\" whereby the rational actions of individuals can lead to irrational (collective) outcomes.\n \nIn the field of dynamical systems, the emergent collective behavior is regarded as a phase transition. The classical coupled oscillator model of Kuramoto is a historically significant prototypical example that exhibits a phase transition.  The model comprises of a large number of heterogeneous oscillators that interact through a mean-field type coupling (interaction) term.  The model exhibits a well-studied phase transition from a disordered incoherence state to an ordered synchronous state. \n \nCoupled oscillators are important to a number of applications, including neuroscience, where a single oscillator is used to model dynamics (tonic firing) of a single neuron.  The population serves as a model of a neuronal network with a large number of interacting neurons.  Although there exists a rich literature on analysis of nonlinear dynamics of coupled oscillator models, and phase transitions therein, the relevance of such analysis to neuroscience suffers from a fundamental problem: Why are these dynamics relevant to the information processing, adaptation, learning and control functions of the neuronal circuits?\n \nThese questions led us to construct a neuro-biologically inspired coupled oscillator model with a certain game theoretic models of interaction.  Collective emergent behavior is addressed in terms of generalizations of Nash equilibria. Remarkably, we discovered that competitive interactions can reproduce the phase transition from incoherence to synchrony.  Our work is the first illustration of the phenomena of rational irrationality for such a model.\n \nOur work also helps elucidate specific competitive mechanisms that underlie self-organization of a neuronal network.  Mathematically, this is accomplished through certain adaptation (learning) schemes whereby each oscillator in the population learns its optimal (in the game-theoretic sense) interaction function.
