 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fear is a powerful emotion and under normal conditions this works to the advantage of every species on this planet. One of the most poignant examples of this is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This project maps the neural circuit underlying the extinction of PTSD by combining molecular genetic tools with in depth behavioral analyses. Using a rodent model of PTSD adapted for use in the mouse, it extinguishes specific symptoms of PTSD such as enhanced fear, increased aggression and disruptions in sexual behavior, by genetically identifying and optogenetically targeting specific subsets of neurons known to be involved in fear inhibition. This project is comprised of three aims. Aim 1 determines whether extinction under the optogenetic activation of a population of cells in the lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala known to be involved in fear inhibition (PKC-d+ neurons) can subsequently reduce PTSD-induced enhancements in fear, increased aggression, and alterations in sexual behavior. Aim 2 determines whether optogenetic silencing of a distinct but intermingled population of neurons (CRH+ neurons) in the same brain region can produce the same reduction in PTSD symptomology. Aim 3 examines whether similar effects can be obtained using selective silencing or activation of prefrontal cortex projections to the amygdala.\r\n\r\nThis project has significant intellectual merit in its cross-disciplinary approach. Namely, it combines cutting-edgemolecular biology and genetic tools with well-designed behavioral paradigms. The application of such molecular techniques with solid\r\nbehavioral design and analyses are intellectually important in terms of the extent to which these tools can be applied to behavioral neuroscience, taught, and shared with the public.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The dissection of PTSD extinction circuitry has the powerful potential to provide a highly targeted, translational approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders and phobias. In addition, this project encourages the teaching, learning and training of optogenetics and applications of molecular biology to questions within psychological science from within the publically accessible and motivated framework of PTSD treatment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Fear is imperative to survival.  As such, the brain has developed powerful and highly effective neural circuits that are capable of rapidly and flexibly organizing fear behaviors in response to threat.  For this reason, when fears are formed inappropriately or expressed excessively, the consequences can be highly detrimental.  This is exemplified by anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), wherein following an extremely traumatic event, animals become highly sensitized and susceptible to the development and expression of a number of maladaptive behaviors.  In contrast to adaptive associative fear memories  or even specific phobias, the neural mechanisms underlying non-associative fear sensitization, and in particular, it's consequences on social behavior, are poorly understood.  The research performed under this award sought to investigate the neural circuitry underlying trauma, with a special focus on the effects of trauma to enhance fear learning to mild stressors, elevate aggression, and disrupt sexual behavior.\n\n In the research carried out here, I established a model of PTSD in mice, in which trauma resulted in the production of maladaptive social behaviors, which were highly resistent to extinction.  This mouse model allowed us to test a number of genetically engineered mouse lines, which thereby enabled selective and specific targetting of different cell types in distinct brain regions.  Using this model, I identified a small group of cells in the extended amygdala that play a necessary and sufficient role in the effect of trauma to enhance aggression. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques, I found that silencing these cells was able to attenuate trauma-induced aggression, and activating these cells was able to generate trauma-like aggression in control mice.  \n\n Collectively, these findings advance our knowledge and understanding in the field of behavioral neuroscience, as they a) establish a mouse model of trauma-induced alterations in social behavior, b) identify a small subset of neurons that encode trauma-enhanced aggression, and c) apply novel technologies towards the control of maladaptive behaviors.  These findings demonstrate that integration across disciplines - here across psychology and biological engineering - allows one to both ask and answer some of the most complex scientific questions.
