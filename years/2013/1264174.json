Specifically, they will develop highly sensitive slot-waveguide Bragg grating and ultrathin interferometer waveguide sensors that are compatible with low-cost laser sources. These devices will be designed to detect small analytes (e.g. proteins and small molecules) and larger particles (e.g. cells, cell fragments, viruses), providing the flexibility to support the diverse needs of biomedical researchers and clinicians.",
