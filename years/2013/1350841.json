Liposomes that can withstand autoclaving are especially desirable for medical applications. The PI proposes to investigate highly stable bipolar membranes (liposomes) with fluorescent tags that probe membrane properties at different membrane depths or at different lateral positions. Specifically, he hypothesizes that there should be significant structural and functional heterogeneities along the membrane normal and in the plane of the membrane, which are of critical importance in understanding membrane structure-function relationship for these ultra-stable architectures.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from this research should enhance the understanding of lipid-protein interactions and solute permeation in archaeal membranes and will have profound implications in technological applications, such as extraordinarily stable lipid matrix for biosensors, light harvesting devices, and nanoparticles for targeted imaging and therapy.",
