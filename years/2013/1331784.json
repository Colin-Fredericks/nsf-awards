 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) will study magnetic reconnection as a fundamental and ubiquitous process in solar coronal plasmas. Fast magnetic reconnection is widely believed to play an important role in triggering eruptive solar flares and accelerating solar energetic particles (SEPs). Using resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and electromagnetic particle simulations, this project will investigate the connection between the so-called 'super-Alfv\u00e9nic instability' (also known as the 'plasmoid instability') of extended current sheets and the onset and dynamics of eruptive flares. \r\n\r\nThis effort will include studies of the saturation mechanisms for the plasmoid instability, the role of the instability in loss-of-equilibrium models, and the effect of self-consistently generated plasma turbulence. The PI will also study the relative importance of collisional and collisionless reconnection regimes, as well as the transition between them, in controlling the rapid onset of eruptive flares.  He will then use fully kinetic electromagnetic particle simulations to investigate the role of magnetic reconnection and multiple plasmoid formation in accelerating particles to high energies. Finally, the PI will compare the predictions of his theory and modeling efforts with observations made by spacecraft. \r\n\r\nThis project will utilize state-of-the-art high performance computing tools and develop interdisciplinary applications for the study of laboratory and space plasmas. The effort will integrate teaching and research in a university environment, involving postdoctoral research scientists and a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. thesis. The PI will also help educate high school students in a summer institute at the University of New Hampshire known as 'Project SMART' (Science and Mathematics Achievement through Research Training). Project SMART provides exciting research experiences for local high school students in New Hampshire.",
