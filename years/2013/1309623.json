An example is the small random-like fluctuations of the electricity frequency known as the Electric Network Frequency (ENF). These environmental fingerprints reflect the attributes and conditions of the power grid and become naturally \"embedded\" into video, audio or other types of sensor signals at the time of recording. They carry time and location information and may facilitate integrity verification of the primary sensing data. Answering questions about the time, location, and integrity of sensor recordings find important applications in crime solving, counter-terrorism, journalism, infrastructure monitoring, smart grid management, and other commercial operations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:       \r\nThe intellectual merit lies on exploring the nearly unchartered research area of forensic evidences in the environment, by drawing synergy across multiple disciplines including signal processing, machine learning, sensor circuits and systems, power engineering, and information forensics/security. The research exploration and technology development of this project are transformative and interdisciplinary in nature.\r\n \r\nBroader impacts:        \r\nThe broader impacts are two folds:  through engaging students, especially female and under-represented ones, in exploratory research, the project's seamless integration of research with education and outreach will prepare the future generation of engineering workforce with interdisciplinary strength; through new technologies and tools developed to advance information forensics, the project has a high potential to benefit a number of applications of global and societal importance.",
