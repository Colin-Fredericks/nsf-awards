 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to establish the feasibility of a high-efficiency, low-cost electric power generator called the C-TEC, for Concentration-mode Thermoelectric Converter.  The C-TEC is an electrochemical converter that generates electricity from heat using a thermally-regenerated concentration gradient of ions across an electrolyte membrane, rather than a thermal gradient across a semiconductor material.  This important difference yields a technology with the potential for the high efficiency of a fuel cell, combined with the low cost, low maintenance, and long life of a thermoelectric device.  Detailed theoretical models and calculations have shown the potential for greater than 30% efficiency in similar devices, but in practice, only 15% to 19% efficiency has ever been realized.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the key elements of a low-cost, high-efficiency design, and created a simple efficiency algorithm for developing a device capable of demonstrating high efficiency.  This efficiency model will be refined using prototype verification builds during the Phase II program, and then used to design, build and test a prototype device suitable for the distributed power generation markets.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of low cost, high efficiency generators that can operate using any form of heat in a wide variety of applications.  C-TEC generators are inherently more versatile than other technologies that require high-grade, specific fuels, such as engines (gasoline), turbines (natural gas), fuel cells (hydrogen), or solar cells (sunlight).  The C-TEC makes no noise, has no moving parts, and requires no maintenance, making it ideal for long-term power generation.  Clean, distributed electricity provided by microCHP (Combined Heat and Power systems at less than 5 kW electrical power) enables breakthrough electrical efficiency greater than 90% in the home, representing an important technology for the widespread adoption of the electric car.  The C-TEC-powered electric car will use domestic natural gas as a bridge to renewables, reducing emissions and dependence on foreign oil and massive infrastructure development costs associated with upgrades to our grid capacity.  Other technologies have been proposed as prime movers for microCHP, including fuel cells and engines, but these fall short in terms of cost and maintenance.  Ultimately, the cost and versatility of the C-TEC will provide economic advantages like fast payback to drive the adoption of new clean technologies.",
