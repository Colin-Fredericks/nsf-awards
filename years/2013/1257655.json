 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding species responses to climate change is one of the central problems in ecology. Over the last decade, the researchers who will lead this project have used the elevation gradient spanning 3500 m from the Amazonian lowlands to the Andean treeline as a natural laboratory for investigating forest and ecosystem ecology. That previous work has documented tree migration in response to climate change, and predicted changes in the ranges of species under different scenarios of change. This project will now go further to investigate the underlying causes of such changes in where trees grow.  The researchers will compare the physiology of plant species known to be migrating in response to climate change in the Andes and Amazon with the physiology of species that are holding their ground, and test the importance of environmental factors such as temperature, soil, herbivory and fungal pathogens.  The results will help understand where tree species can survive, what affects their growth, and what limits their range along environmental gradients.  The project will increase our ability to predict and model the effects of climate change on natural systems, particularly tropical montane forests, which are areas of high biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a suite of educational activities, resources, and opportunities aimed at teaching K-12 and college students about tropical ecology and the effects of global climate change; training opportunities for international and minority students which will assist them in pursuing advanced education and careers in the natural sciences; and the dissemination of results to a broad scientific and lay audience, including Spanish translations and versions of resources.",

Working along a steep gradient of elevation, temperature and precipitation in tropical Andes -- the area with the highest concentration of species on Earth -- we tested the causal underpinning of two basic and salient patterns of biodiversity as related to climate.&nbsp; The first pattern is that most tree species have very narrow ranges, or realized niches, with respect to the environment.&nbsp; The second pattern is that these ranges are changing through time. From fossil records we know that species moved in the past to remain in their favored temperature and moisture zones. Somewhat incredibly, using repeat inventories of the modern Andean forests, we can also see that tree species are now migrating towards cooler temperatures in response to current warming.&nbsp; Both range breadths and the responses to warming vary widely among species.</p>\n<p>While these patterns are fairly well established, what has not been adequately explained, especially in hyper-diverse tropical forests, is why. Why do species occur where they do and not elsewhere?&nbsp; Why do some species migrate while others don&rsquo;t?
