Topological states are interesting due to the exotic physics they harbor and their technological promise for quantum computation, among other applications. The PI will pursue three areas in this burgeoning field: \r\n\r\n1) Investigating realistic new methods for engineering non-Abelian topological phases in solid-state devices, which may eventually serve as the backbone of a decoherence-free quantum computer. \r\n\r\n2) Devising approaches for generating topological insulator phases in systems that would ordinarily be conventional metals or insulators. \r\n\r\n3) Exploring novel quantum phases in frustrated magnets exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, qualitatively new spin-liquid phases that exist solely due to spin-orbit coupling will be studied, with emphasis on possible experimental realizations. \r\n\r\nEducation and outreach activities are aimed to simultaneously promote diversity and improve science education at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. By partnering with physics teachers from high schools with many students of low-socioeconomic status, the PI will work to revamp the curriculum by incorporating modern topics of scientific and societal importance, examples include quantum computing, global warming, and energy independence. In particular, the PI will introduce the concept of emergence into high-school classrooms, using familiar ideas such as bird flocking to convey the organizational principles at work in condensed matter. Low-cost, sustainable labs that teachers can independently run in future classes will also be implemented into the courses. Undergraduate and graduate curricula will be similarly modernized, and undergraduates will form an integral component of the PI's research group. A new informal condensed matter seminar for UC Irvine's students and post-docs will also be instituted to help train a new generation of researchers with broad backgrounds and exceptional communication skills. \r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports theoretical research that explores exotic new phases of matter and searches for practical ways of realizing them in the laboratory. Inside of any solid lies a colossal number of electrons which, choreographed by the laws of quantum mechanics, can organize themselves in truly spectacular ways. This organization underlies a wealth of phenomena - metals, semiconductors, magnets, and superconductors being noteworthy examples. At sufficiently low temperature, superconductors have the property that electricity can flow them without resistance. Understanding the collective behavior of electrons in a solid not only reveals profound fundamental properties of nature, but in some cases can lead to transformative technologies. \r\n\r\nSystems in which electrons exhibit a very subtle type of organization known as \"topological order\" are a current major focus of condensed matter physics. Materials exhibiting such \"topological phases\" are widely coveted for their exotic properties and technological promise. In particular, these materials may hold the key to building a new generation of computers that employ quantum mechanics to drastically outperform today's fastest computers for certain tasks. So far few topological phases have been identified in nature. The PI's research will seek to circumvent this problem by investigating experimentally feasible ways of engineering topological phases in devices whose constituents are all well-understood. New routes to generating topological order in insulators, superconductors, and magnets will all be studied. This research may lead to the exciting discovery of new emergent particles and facilitate the eventual synthesis of a \"quantum computer\". \r\n\r\n\r\nEducation and outreach activities are aimed to simultaneously promote diversity and improve science education at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMaterials are invariably composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons, which are all well-understood elementary particles.  Nevertheless, interactions among these microscopic constituents can conspire to generate fundamentally new kinds of \"emergent\" particles known as anyons.  Anyons cannot live in isolation, but rather are born within materials that realize certain exotic phases of matter.  Accordingly, they exhibit fascinating quantum mechanical properties that transcend the behavior of all elementary particles (such as electrons).  The fascinating fundamental physics exhibited by anyons is complemented by tantalizing technological applications: In principle, one can exploit anyons to build inherently robust quantum computers that are capable of wildly outperforming conventional computers for certain kinds of tasks.  \nMuch of the research supported by this grant explored routes toward revealing the exotic properties of anyons and harnessing their quantum-computing potential.  A core principle that drove our research is the idea that one can engineer platforms for anyons by combining ingredients that, individually, are widely available and well understood (for instance, semiconductors and conventional superconductors).  We developed new hardware blueprints for anyons, \"smoking-gun\" detection experiments, practical routes for their manipulation and readout, scalable designs for anyon-based quantum-computing hardware, and new applications of anyons that had not been previously appreciated.  Theory research on these topics has helped to inspire ongoing experimental efforts by leading groups worldwide.  \nThis grant also supported a multifaceted education and outreach program aimed at producing a new generation of researchers and inspiring interest in these areas more broadly.  This agenda was carried out through training of students; outreach events targeting local schools with large underrepresented or economically disadvantaged populations; a YouTube animation explaining anyons to a general audience; organization of special-topic schools and workshops; and a variety of lectures ranging from TED-style talks to technical seminars.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason F Alicea"
