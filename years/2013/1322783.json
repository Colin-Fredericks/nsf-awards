 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elaborate genetic networks drive complex phenotypes such as social behaviors. The recent sequencing of genomes of several social species such as the honey bee and the bumblebee provide powerful opportunities to study sociality in molecular terms. This collaborative project focuses on molecular mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of division of labor among social insects workers. Studies will investigate the role of microRNAs in regulating two systems of division of labor; age-dependent division of labor in highly social honey bees, and size-related division of labor in bumblebees. The first goal is to investigate the role of miRNAs in behavior by comparing changes in brain-enriched microRNAs that are associated with division of labor in both species. The second goal is to determine whether hormonal signals that affect division of labor in honey bees, but not bumblebees, are mediated via the action of honey bee specific microRNAs. The third goal is to establish causation between the action of conserved miRNAs and the regulation of behavioral plasticity by looking in the fruit fly, Drosophila. Both honey bees and bumblebees are economically important due to their unique roles as pollinators of diverse crops. The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern bee behavior in particular, and animal foraging behaviors in general.     \r\n\r\nThese studies will also provide extensive training opportunities. High school and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, will be trained in collecting behavioral, molecular, and physiological data, their analyses, and in scientific presentations at local and national meetings. Furthermore, this project will serve as an excellent mentorship opportunity for the postdoctoral fellow who will lead the studies. Finally, this international collaboration will foster research ties between American and Israeli research institutions, which will include reciprocal international training opportunities for personnel from both labs.",
