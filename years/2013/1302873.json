 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of the NSF-supported California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP). Initiated in 1993-1994, CSU-LSAMP is an alliance of the 23 campuses of the California State University (CSU) system, which supports a coordinated and comprehensive system-wide approach to broadening participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. CSU-LSAMP's overall goal for the project is to contribute to the development of a STEM workforce, which is broadly inclusive, globally competitive, and prepared to participate at the frontiers of science. Specifically, CSU-LSAMP aims to: \r\na)Enhance the academic and professional preparation of CSU-LSAMP participants, most of whom are students from underrepresented minorities (URM), for careers in STEM. \r\nb)Further improve persistence and graduation rates for CSU-LSAMP participants. \r\nc)Increase aggregate production of STEM degrees awarded by the CSU to URM students.\r\nd)Increase the number of CSU-LSAMP students who advance to STEM graduate study. \r\ne)Document, disseminate, and replicate undergraduate intervention models that increase access to, and success in STEM baccalaureate degree programs and facilitate admissions to STEM graduate programs.",
