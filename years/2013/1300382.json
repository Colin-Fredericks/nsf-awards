 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Daniel Seidel of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, will attempt to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation.  A major goal is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral anionic and zwitterionic intermediates.  Catalytic amounts of chiral anion receptors will be used in combination with simple nucleophilic catalysts, Bronsted acids and other co-catalysts and promoters to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes. These strategies will be used to address challenging problems such as the kinetic resolution and desymmetrization of amines and diamines. \r\n \r\nThe ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that will emerge from this work will provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, diamines, natural and unnatural amino acids, tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids, carbolines and other indole containing substances, which should, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.  Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis through the exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation.  Several classes of reactions were developed that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  We developed a new class of chiral Br&oslash;nsted acid catalysts in which an anion recognition site (a thiourea moiety) is connected via a chiral linker to an acidic site (a carboxylic acid).  Upon substrate protonation, the conjugate acid binds to the anion recognition site, resulting in the formation of a rigid substrate-catalyst ion pair.  Using a new chiral carboxylic acid catalyst that can be prepared on scale in just two steps from cheap starting materials, we developed the first catalytic enantioselective Povarov reaction with secondary amines such as indoline, the first enantioselective intramolecular Povarov reaction (which also represents the first catalytic enantioselective aza-Diels-Alder reaction), a highly enantioselective Pictet-Spengler reaction of unmodified tryptamine, and a highly enantioselective A3 reaction with secondary amines.  In a related project, we explored the kinetic resolution of amines via a dual catalysis approach.  DMAP and a chiral bis-thiourea catalyst act in concert to resolve racemic amines via benzoylation.  Multiple reaction parameters were examined that provided important insights into the mechanism of this transformation.  The catalyst pair, upon interaction with benzoic anhydride, forms a chiral ion pair that acts as the acyl-transfer reagent.  A key feature of this ion pair is the binding of a catalyst thiourea subunit to the benzoate counteranion of the DMAP-derived N-benzoyl pyridinium salt.  This notion is corroborated by the demonstrated ability of the catalyst to bind benzoate in 1:1 fashion.  Catalyst aggregation, as observed in the solid state and in solution, is responsible, at least in part, for the fact that reduced catalyst loadings provide better selectivities in some instances.  Computational investigations provided detailed insights into the nature of the chiral ion pairs.  For the bis-thiourea catalyst, dual intramolecular hydrogen bonding of one thiourea subunit to the sulfur atom of the second thiourea subunit was found to activate this moiety for anion binding via acidification of the two N&ndash;H bonds.  This project provided valuable training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Seidel"
