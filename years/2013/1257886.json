 "awd_abstract_narration": "In animals, normal limb movements such as walking or reaching require sensory information from the limb regarding their movements and mechanics.  While fishes use their limbs (or paired fins) for a diverse array of behaviors, little is known about the role sensory abilities plays in those functions.  This project examines the fundamental question of how the sensory and motor elements of the fin propulsive system co-adapt to generate a functional neuromechanical system.  In particular, it will determine how physical properties of the fins such as stiffness, size and shape, are reflected in the biological instrumentation of the fins for sensation.  In addition to providing a new tractable model for studying integration of sensation and movement, data from this project will inform the design of fin-inspired propulsive devices for underwater vehicles. The broader impacts of this project will provide outreach experiences for children on the South Side of Chicago as well as opportunities for undergraduate and graduate training in the laboratory and builds educational activities at the Field Museum of Natural History.",

Proprioception is critical to our ability to use our forelimbs to reach, grasp and perform other tasks. Despite the importance of proprioception to movement in tetrapods, many fundamental questions exist on how such systems are structured and function and how they vary across species.\n\nHere we examine forelimb proprioception in fishes to inform general understanding of this sensory modality, to address fundamental questions of proprioception in fishes, which are only beginning to be explored from the perspective of mechanosensation. Not only do we aim to better understand this sensory modality but also this research may be of use to engineers designing autonomous underwater swimming devices. Fish forelimbs (the pectoral fins) are readily accessible and function in a range of behavior including locomotion (studied here), grooming, brood care and feeding.\n\nThe specific aims of the proposed work are to use the morphologically and behaviorally diverse group of pectoral fin swimmers, the wrasses (Labridae), as a study system in which to explore how sensory function is related to fin ray biomechanics and movement of fins during swimming and to test the role of fin ray proprioception in locomotion.  Wrasses were chosen because of their diversity and the extensive use of the pectoral fins in swimming.\n\nOur research has shown that the fins of all fish studied are invested with mechanosensory nerve fibers and that fin sensory nerve fibers are capable of capturing proprioceptive information.
