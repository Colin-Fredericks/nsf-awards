 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neural processing of auditory vibrations plays a crucial role in hearing and communication. This process starts when hair cells transform a mechanical stimulus into a neural signal, and continues as the signal is transmitted into the brain for processing. This project uses physiological techniques to understand the functional relationships between neurons associated with hair cells. The goal is to provide an understanding of these neurons in a simple system in order to better understand their role in more complex vertebrate hair cell systems. The broader impact of this work is to advance the understanding of how normal hair cell systems function is essential for continued progress towards of better understanding of auditory neural processing during health and disease.  It is anticipated that there will be many applications of this work, from diagnosing hearing disorders to inspiring robotic sensor design.  The broader impact of this work will also include training of undergraduates, graduate students and post doctoral associates in Northeast Florida, a region which historically has been plagued with inadequate scientific literacy, and prepare these individuals for independent scientific careers.",

In this project, the intellectual merit we provide comes from the first comprehensive analysis of how afferent neurons respond to mechanical deflection of hair cells.
