 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in biology is how complex forms have evolved. One common way for animals to become complex is through being built of repeated parts, like body segments, that can be changed independently. The largest group of segmented animals is the arthropods. Most arthropods make their segments by adding them from a posterior region called the \"growth zone\". A common set of genes has recently been hypothesized to control the growth zone in diverse arthropods. However, the cell processes that elongate the growth zone are elusive. Without understanding the cell processes that normally elongate the growth zone, it is impossible to explain the role of genes in controlling segmentation. This work will synthesize two approaches to understanding growth zone elongation and segmentation. First, direct measures of cell processes such as cell division, cell shape, cell motility and gene function will be made in three arthropod species, a crustacean and two insects. Then, these data will be fed into computational models of segment formation. Lab results will keep the computer models realistic while computer models will allow rapid exploration of relationships between genes and cell processes and thus inform new lab work. This project will be the first to bring computational modeling to a fine-grain analysis of arthropod sequential segmentation. The results will be important for studies of development and for synthetic biology. The proposed work is an international collaboration between 3 research labs with both unique and overlapping expertise. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs will participate in multi-disciplinary training that synthesizes laboratory and computational approaches, fostering an integration of quantitative and experimental skills early in their careers. Importantly, students will also have the opportunity for international exchange between Israeli and US labs, through summer exchanges between the labs, and \"live\" exchange of ideas during regular web-based meetings. The outcomes of this work will also be shared with the public through outreach events in K-12 classes, local science centers, museums and public lectures such as the popular \"Science Caf\u00e9s\".",

One of the most widespread forms of complexity among animals is the repetition of parts, like body segments. A body plan composed of such repeated parts is found in several animal groups, most notably in the arthropods, the group that includes such familiar animals as insects, crabs and spiders. The most common means of developing segments is to add them one at a time from a posterior region of the animal, called the &ldquo;growth zone&rdquo;. This region has been the focus of intense study to discover the regulatory gene networks that pattern new segments. Here we focus on a less understood feature of the growth zone, the cell behaviors that underlie elongation and lead to the progressive budding of segments. Our international collaborative team examined three different taxa: the flour beetle <em>Tribolium</em>, the milkweed bug <em>Oncopeltus</em>, and the fairy shrimp <em>Thamnocephalus</em>, and used a parallel set of measures to describe growth and elongation from the posterior during segmentation in each species. Our description took into account changes in tissue dimensions over time, gene expression patterns and cellular behavior. These results are the first consistent cross-species dataset of growth zone dynamics and they have uncovered a number of previously unknown features. We found in two species that the growth zone is functionally divided into two parts: a posterior domain, where there is stable gene expression and relatively high rates of cell cycling, and an anterior domain, with dynamic gene expression and low rates of cell cycling. We found that cell behaviors underlying elongation are not constant over time, both cell division and cell movement vary during normal segment addition and, surprisingly, the rate of segment addition is variable in the flour beetle. We used a computational model of the beetle embryo to support our hypothesis that rapid segment addition can occur without significant addition of new cells. We also coupled the proposed <em>Tribolium</em> gene regulatory network that generates segments to our cell based model.<br /> This new model provides support for an insect segmentation clock that can function without two key components of the vertebrate segmentation clock: a wavefront and the cell-cell communication for maintaining local clock synchrony. Finally, in the two species where segment addition spans distinct regions of the body axis, we find a clear correlation between axial position and growth zone cell behaviors. These data support a model of growth zone cell dynamics that displays surprising spatio-temporal variability and potential adaptability among arthropods. Broader impacts from this collaborative effort included linking undergraduates from a teaching college to scientists at a research university.
