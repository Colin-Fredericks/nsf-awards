 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a better understanding of the formation and transformation of Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) and will examine how Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOC) interact with anthropogenic pollution to alter the atmosphere's oxidative capacity and enhance SOA formation. Hourly measurements will be made, using a Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph (SVTAG) system, of speciated vapor and particle phase intermediate and semi-volatile organic compounds during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) to be conducted in Alabama in the summer of 2013. The time-evolution of secondary organic compounds and their precursors will be studied a smog chamber and compared with data from the SOAS campaign to ascertain whether mechanisms observed in the smog chamber are supported by the field data.\r\n \r\nThis study will make a significant contribution to understanding the formation of secondary organic aerosol in a heavily forested region with natural emissions of volatile organic compounds. Emissions of air pollutants from urban areas may enhance secondary aerosol formation. The data collected in this project will be critical to advancing the knowledge and prediction of regional atmospheric chemistry, ozone and secondary aerosol production, and their role in climate processes.",
