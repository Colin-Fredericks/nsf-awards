 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a \r\nrevolutionary new sensor for aging-in-place and assisted living which uses a network of \r\nradio frequency (RF) transceivers as a sensor in a home to track a person?s location and \r\ndetect falls.  The sensor is contact-free, i.e., a person does not need to remember to wear it \r\nin order to be monitored.  The system monitors links for changes in signal strength which \r\nindicate a person being near the line between two transceivers.  Algorithms use the link \r\ninformation to infer the location of a person.  With transceivers at two different heights, \r\nalgorithms can distinguish whether a person is standing, sitting, or laying on the floor, and \r\nuse the speed at which someone moves to the floor to detect a dangerous fall. Room-level \r\ntracking can also be used to look for unusual patterns which indicate physical or cognitive \r\ndecline.  This project will develop methods to minimize deployment time and expertise.  It \r\nwill develop novel algorithms that allow for a lower density of transceivers in the system, \r\nand still achieve room-level tracking and fall detection accuracy.  Live demonstrations will \r\nbe conducted with potential investors and customers.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability for the sensor to \r\nincrease the ability of an elder to safely age-in-place in their preferred living environment, \r\nbenefitting them and reducing the costs of nursing home care. Unfortunately, many older \r\npeople fall each year, often when alone, resulting in long delays before help arrives.  The \r\nfear of falling and being unable to get help is a reason many enter nursing care.  Older \r\nadults at risk for cognitive decline (e.g., dementia) could live independently longer with \r\nsensing systems that help caregivers monitor their well-being.  Beyond aging-in-place, \r\nthese technologies have application in hospitals; smart-building systems for automation and \r\nenergy efficiency; security systems; retail analytics; and generally for context- and location-\r\naware computing applications. Existing technologies use (1) wearable sensors, which are often forgotten, \r\n(2) video camera surveillance, which is seen as too invasive of privacy, or (3) infrared motion sensors, \r\nwhich do not detect falls and are prone to false alarms.  In contrast, the proposed sensor does not \r\nneed to be worn, reliably senses falls, and is privacy-preserving.  Our sensor provides \r\ncapabilities currently unavailable, and will be bought by aging-in-place monitoring and \r\nsystem integrator companies.",
