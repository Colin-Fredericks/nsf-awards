 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Otterbein University group of Nathaniel Tagg and his team of undergraduate students will conduct research on neutrino oscillations and interactions using experiments in the Fermilab NuMI and Booster neutrino beams.  The research program includes the study of neutrino oscillations (in the MINOS+ experiment), measuring neutrino nucleus cross sections (in the MINERvA experiment), measuring neutrino velocity (MINOS+), and searching for anomalous events that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model (the MicroBooNE experiment).   A special contribution of the group and an exciting broader impact of their research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by the scientists.",
