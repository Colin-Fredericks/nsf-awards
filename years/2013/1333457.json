 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is the development of stochastic comparison techniques for performance analysis of queueing models.  The models considered will include systems with many servers, abandonments, and heavy-tailed processing and inter-arrival times.  The research will focus on identifying conditions on the parameters of two queueing models which ensure that the performance metrics of the two models can be compared. Emphasis will be given to models which exhibit certain non-monotonicities, for example systems with abandonments, in which adding extra jobs can actually cause the number in system to decrease.  These conditions will then be used to transfer performance analysis results between different queueing models. The research will combine these conditions with tools from asymptotic analysis and probability theory to analyze how the performance of these systems depends on the underlying model parameters, with an emphasis on understanding both the behavior of these systems as the number of servers grows large, and the probability of certain rare events associated with exceptionally high levels of congestion.  The research will also lead to the formulation and analysis of novel scaling regimes for queueing systems with heavy tails.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will advance the state-of-the-art in stochastic modeling and analysis in two ways. First, the research will yield new bounds and insights into the performance of many-server queues with abandonments and heavy tails, which arise in the modeling, design, and analysis of service systems.  Second, the research will lead to the development of novel stochastic comparison and analysis methodologies, which may be more broadly applicable in the study of probabilistic models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe act of queueing for services is a fundamental component of many human endeavors and activities, from sitting in traffic to boarding an airplane to waiting in a hospital ER to being put on hold after calling a tech-support helpline.  Such queueing phenomena also arise in other important societal tasks, including the management of supply chains, the control of complex manufacturing processes, and the routing of data on the internet.  For society to design, staff, and operate these systems optimally, we must understand the fundamental mathematics and data analytics that govern how the basic parameters of such a system, including the arrival and service rates and the variability of these processes, impact overall waiting times.  \n\nThis project developed new mathematical tools to analyze these systems, and showed that complex queueing models can, somewhat surprisingly, be well-approximated by much simpler systems which are easier to understand and optimize.  These insights furthered our understanding of how the waiting time in these systems scales when the system is very large, as well as the probability of undesirable rare events in such systems (such as seeing a massive queue length).  The project focused specifically on understanding: 1. how systems behave as both the arrival rate and the number of servers grow large together, 2. how large systems are impacted when service times are highly variable, and 3. how enabling waiting jobs to abandon the system precisely impacts the probability of seeing a very large queue length.  In all cases, the project significantly advanced the state-of-the-art, resolving several long-standing gaps in our understanding of these systems.\n\nThe knowledge gained was disseminated to other researchers through top-tier conference presentations and journal publications, and has already had a significant impact on the academic study of such models.  In addition, the findings were incorporated into classes at both the undergraduate and Ph.D. level in Georgia Tech?s Industrial and Systems Engineering program, ensuring that the next generation of leaders in industrial engineering and operations research can benefit from our new understanding of such queueing models.  The research also formed the core of a Ph.D. student?s doctoral thesis.  This graduate student successfully defended his thesis, and is now applying his knowledge in industry, ensuring that the ideas also have real-world impact.  The research also proved helpful in a collaboration between several undergraduates at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech and Atlanta police departments, in which big-data analytics were applied to help the police departments analyze and optimize their operations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Goldberg"
