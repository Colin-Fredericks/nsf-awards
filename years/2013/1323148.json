 "awd_abstract_narration": "The highest rates of erosion of bedrock on Earth are generally thought to occur\r\nin steep areas subject to the action of large rivers and glaciers. However, \r\nthere are many deserts around the world where wind and wind-blown sand are the \r\ndominant agents of erosion and where even relatively flat bedrock landforms can be \r\neroded as quickly as the fastest eroding rivers and glacial valleys on Earth. \r\nRelatively little is known about how wind and wind-blown sand erodes bedrock and\r\nwhat variables control the morphology of yardangs, the dominant landforms created\r\nin such areas. Wind erosion can also influence the behavior of faults and folds \r\nin the Earth's crust by reducing the stress caused by topography in areas of high \r\nerosion (i.e. on the windward side of a slipping fault or growing fold). \r\n\r\nFurther global climate changes will likely lead to more desertification, making \r\nwind erosion and its impacts on humans (e.g. reduced air quality) even more \r\nimportant to understand and predict. This project will improve our ability to \r\nquantify wind erosion, a process influencing human health and land sustainability. \r\nThe project includes field areas in southern California and the Qaidam \r\nBasin of the Tibetan Plateau (in collaboration with Chinese colleagues). We will combine field work, remote sensing, numerical \r\nmodeling, and geochronology to quantify the interaction between the flow of wind and\r\nwind-blown sand over topography, the erosion of that topography, and the behavior\r\nof faults and folds in Earth's crust. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, Tectonics Program, and NSF's OIIA International Science and Engineering Section.",
