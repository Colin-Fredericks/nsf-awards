 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical and dynamical processes that control, and at times constrain, climate-hydrology connections over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) operate on top of highly variable and constantly changing land use and vegetation cover conditions. The central hypothesis of this project is that key mechanisms and drivers of climate-hydrology-land use connections and associated hydro-climatic variability and changes over the GHA can only be well understood through an integrated process-based approach, employing a dynamically coupled climate-hydrology modeling system. Under this support, multiple observation datasets will be utilized to investigate historical climate events, especially droughts.  A comparison between an ensemble of coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulations and a suite of Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiments (CORDEX) model simulations will be undertaken. The role of global SST anomalies, change in Congo Air Mass, and changes in land use/cover characteristics in extreme precipitation (droughts/floods) will be examined.",

The density function distribution of wet days was also slightly right-skewed, thus showing a tendency of less extremely wet days during the season.\n\nUsing thresholds of 5th and 95th percentiles  to define extremely dry and wet conditions,respectively, our research however showed no significant projected changes in the key components of the hydrological cycle ( E and P) by the middle of the 21st century, in both RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. This is mostly consistent over the southern parts of the Horn of Africa. Over the northern parts, a slight decreasing trend in precipitation is dominant, with P-E is mostly negative indicating relatively drier conditions are projected to occur over these regions by the middle of the 21st century.\n\nFinally, how precipitation pattern will likely change in future over most parts of the Horn of Africa  tend to depend significnatly on the balance between P and ET and the critical processes driving that balance or imbalance.  Over the Horn of Africa our research showed there is generally a projected surplus of mositure  flux(E&gt;P) during the transition between the predominantly bimodal rainfall  regime ( MAM and OND seasons), based on velocity potential anaysis of both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios from an ensemble of six CMIP5 models .

Over the northern regions analysis of velocity potential display anomalous moisture influx from the Congo forest, Gulf of Guinea and the Mediterranean that tend to contribute significantly to the anomalous precipitation projected over these areas.\n\nOver the southern parts of the Horn of Africa the projected  orientation of the Indian Ocean Walker-type of circulation during DJF implies that Indian Ocean is apparently the primary source of  moisture. However, there is a projected decrease in mositure flux into the region  during MAM season which seems  to be a secondary response to increased precipitation over the Congo Basin, which leads to mositure deficit especially over equatorial and parts of southern Horn of Africa  due to predominantly northwest transport of mositure into the Congo Basin.\n\n \n\n.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard O Anyah"
