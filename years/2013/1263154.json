 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry REU program at Syracuse University (SU) will provide research opportunities for students in a unique research environment created to combine structured learning with maximum hands-on time in the laboratory. Participants will experience the entire scientific process: planning and conducting experiments, interpreting results, drawing conclusions, and presenting their results in written and oral form. The overall theme of the program is \"research in chemistry\", involving all faculty members in the department. This topic was chosen to expose participants to the full breadth of chemical research, including the vast array of chemistry subfields and related interdisciplinary topics. Additional funds will extend the program to several other students, some of them participants in the SU LSAMP program, plus two high school teachers. The unique partnership with Le Moyne College (LMC) in Syracuse will support the development of year-round collaborative research programs between the two institutions. Specific emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of at least one veteran utilizing SU's or LMC's veteran's resource center. Financial support and recruiting assistance by several minority inclusion programs on campus (LSAMP, McNair, and CSTEP) demonstrates SU's commitment to involve underrepresented students in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThis program will introduce a diverse group of students to a rigorous research environment, motivating and readying them for scientific careers or graduate school in the chemical sciences. The program will include veteran students, minority students, students with limited access to research, international students, and high school teachers, providing all with the benefit of exposure to peers with wide-ranging experience and perspectives. Results will be reported through publications and conference presentations, many made by the students themselves. Students will be involved in highly relevant research projects that directly benefit society while covering the breadth of chemical research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Syracuse University Department of Chemistry, with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, has provided summer research opportunities for a total of 63 U.S. undergraduate students from 2013 to 2016.  The Syracuse University program, running continuously since 2000, also includes students from universities in Graz, Austria through an international exchange program.  Of the 63 U.S. students, 33 were supported by NSF, with the rest supported by the University, individual faculty grants, and several minority inclusion programs.  Of the REU participants, 30% were underrepresented minority students.  The 63 REU students were selected from 476 applicants.  Through a direct collaboration with Le Moyne College, seven Le Moyne students were included in the REU program, with about 50% of the funding provided by Le Moyne.  Three high school teachers, with support from the University, were also included in the program.\n\nBased on their interests, participants are each paired with a faculty mentor, and they spend the summer doing research on their own project with the guidance of the faculty mentor and members of his or her research group.  This experience helps the students in several ways.  It exposes them to the methods of scientific research and broadens their classroom-based education.  It gives them a taste of graduate school, helping them to decide whether to choose this path while preparing them for it.  It demonstrates the importance of interpersonal communication in science and provides them with good practice as well as contacts in the field.\n\nThe Syracuse University program, while centered around the research experience, also includes vibrant educational and social components.  Students are welcomed at a picnic and say farewell at a banquet.  In between, participants assemble for lunch each Tuesday to hear about other chemistry projects and, near the end of the summer, to present their own.  They participate in ethics and career workshops.  They each present a poster to the campus community.  They try their hands at glassblowing and visit a glass museum.  They do a ropes course, attend ice cream socials, and take weekend trips together.  The inclusion of the Austrian students makes it an international experience for all.\n\nThe university keeps in touch with past participants and follows their continuing education and entry into the chemistry profession or whatever else they decide to do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael B Sponsler"
