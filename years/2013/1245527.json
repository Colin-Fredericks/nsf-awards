 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 24-month, TUES-Type1 project at Rutgers University New Brunswick is developing a novel cyberinfrastructure resource that provides General Chemistry 1 and 2 students an on-line environment for interactive, self-guided development of analytic problem solving skills.  Known as GCeLS, for General Chemistry eLearning System, the project is organizing relational databases around a 'critical skills network' that serves as a central web connecting all elemental problem-solving steps.  GCeLS is being developed to deliver custom exercises with tunable levels of difficulty and breadth of required skills.  The interactive environment is incorporating deep feedback mechanisms through hints, guided solutions, and teaching modules.  GCeLS is also providing a mechanism to track student data that can be used to assess mastery both by an individual student and by the instructor.  The system is being engineered to allow instructors detailed control over problem delivery for either on-line homework assignments or to be used as a personalized study tool.  By using an anytime, anywhere electronic resource to enable students to master commonly encountered challenges in General Chemistry, the project is enabling instructors to use limited face-to-face time with students to develop more deeply, the engaging concepts and challenges in chemistry.  The enhanced classroom interactions with students is leading to a better educational experience of students in General Chemistry, and is leading to increased success, better retention, and more STEM majors.  The transformational resource being developed by the project can be utilized by many institutions and even adapted to other disciplines.  The project's evaluation is focusing on the impact GCeLS  has on both student learning of and attitudes towards chemistry, and the nature of faculty instruction, and will have up to 120 students in each of the treatment and paired control groups.  Pre- and post-test scores on select content areas and final exams results are being used to document impact on student learning of course content as well as degree of knowledge and skills transfer to other areas.  SALG (Student Assessment of Learning Gains) surveys are used to assess changes in students' attitude towards chemistry.  Pre- and post-surveys as well as structured interviews are informing the project about how faculty use the information provided by GCeLS to inform their instruction and student office hour visits.",

Online homework systems offer many potential advantages, including instant feedback to students, adaptive learning capability, and valuable data to instructors that help identify learning obstacles on-the-fly. However, there does not currently exist network infrastructure that allows a global community of online learners to leverage this wealth of data, which may be generated from different online systems, in order to facilitate synchronous interactions, enable higher cognitive skills to be exercised, and enhance team learning in cyberspace. We have recently developed a framework for the creation of a new networking paradigm to build effective online learning communities: Academic Social Networks (ASNs). The framework integrates several key components: problem template engines (PTEs) that generate questions or exercises that test specific learning objectives, a critical skills network (CSN) that established an underlying fingerprint for each problem that is generated, and a virtual classroom environment (VCE) that allows synchronous interactions to take place in order to enable problem solving and team learning in cyberspace. These components act together to create an environment where students can work problems in order to assess mastery of specific learning objectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Specifically, we have developed an adaptive General Chemistry eLearning System (GceLS) that uses PTEs to create (infinite) variations of problems that test a specific Learning Objective/Outcome (LO) at a particulary complexity level which is determined by the specific set of critical skills required by the problem. The student's performance history determines their mastery of each LO at different complexity levels. Each PTE is categorized by a Bloom's taxonomy level, and is associated with the General Chemistry Anchoring Concept Content Map (ACCM). Students can utilize a &ldquo;practice mode&rdquo; that does not count toward their mastery until they are ready to for mastery assessment. Students are also required assess their own self-efficacy by clarifying whether they are &ldquo;Confident&rdquo;, &ldquo;Somewhat Confident&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not Confident&rdquo; in their answer to a PTE problem. Students are able to monitor their progress in mastering LOs using a &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo; which provides a detailed report of the individual student's performance progress, as well as corresponding mean and standard deviations from the rest of the class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GCeLS provides the foundation for the ASN from which mastery of LOs can be tracked, and specific learning pathways can be analyzed. A student struggling with a specific LO can reach out to the ASN to connect with other students that have demonstrated mastery of that LO at the same complexity level or higher, and that have a track record at effective peer-mentoring, to get help. Ultimately, this framework leverages large enrollments to facilitate on-demand peer mentoring and delivery of custom instruction at scale.
