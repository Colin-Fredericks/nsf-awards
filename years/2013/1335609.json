 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this project is to develop manufacturable, monolithic integrated optoelectronic and electronic circuits by integrating III-V compound nanopillar optoelectronic devices onto silicon substrates. The objectives of this research are (1) to control the synthesis of nanostructures on silicon such that they can be placed or seeded by design and scaled for mass production and (2) develop electrically pumped lasers monolithically integrated with silicon photonics and electronics. Using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition synthesis technique, the nanopillar growth mechanism will be fully investigated to achieve precise control of growth sites, density, doping and heterostructure formation. Heterostructures are sandwich layers of different materials. Building upon that, electrically-pumped nanopillar laser with a silicon transparent emission wavelength will be designed, fabricated, and characterized. Furthermore, nanopillar lasers will be integrated onto silicon waveguides with high coupling efficiency for optoelectronic applications. Waveguides are structures that guide light or electromagnetic waves.\r\n\r\nThe development of such optoelectronic integrated circuits will bridge the gap between optoelectronic devices on III-V semiconductor platform and integrated circuits on silicon with a unique manufacturing mechanism. Its success will add novel breakthrough functionalities onto cost-effective silicon wafers with greatly reduced power consumption, size, and weight. One of its transformational impacts on our society could be bringing our personal hand-held devices to a wide spectrum of applications in healthcare, sensing, imaging, and communication. In addition, this project will result in a disruptive technology for nanomaterial manufacturing, developing a major capability that will fundamentally transform the synthesis of lattice-mismatched materials, which are materials whose crystal structures don?t match up. Together with its research activities primarily conducted by graduate students, this project will also offer interdisciplinary opportunities for high school and undergraduate students to gain hands-on experiences in cutting-edge research.",

Such integrated circuits (ICs) will underpin health and environment monitoring, food and water safety sensing and many other functions of the future.  The required monolithic functional blocks include three basic categories of components: (1) efficient light sources (lasers or light emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs), (2) Si CMOS driver circuitry, and (3) Si photonic integrated circuits (PIC) to route and manipulate light.  As (1) the light sources are based on materials known as III-V compound semiconductors (such as GaAs and InP) and the latter two are based on silicon, and the material systems have different lattice constants and incompatible processing temperatures, it has been extremely challenging to integrate light sources on Si-based ICs or PICs.\n\nTo facilitate such integration, LEDs and lasers must be manufactured on silicon substrate with a process that is compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistor technology.  We chose to start with nanopillars because we have previously demonstrated that nanostructures are able to accommodate large lattice mismatches between III-V semiconductors and silicon. \n\nUnder this program, we achieved breakthrough results of nanopillar lasers on Si with three material systems: GaAs and InP nanopillars, and InGaAs quantum well on InP nanopillars, all as-grown monolithically on Si substrates.

Most critically, the synthesis process and temperature needs to be compatible with silicon-based electronic circuits.  The nanopillar growth mode was initiated by nanoclusters due to lattice mismatch without catalysts and grew into core/shell structured pillars.  As a result, III-V active region is wrapped inside the pillar and not susceptive to surface recombination centers.

These structures can potentially revolutionize the way single crystals are grown and devices are manufactured. These highly mismatched structures can be a new vehicle for novel nanomanufacturing technique.\n\nBroader Impact:\n\nNanostructured materials are poised to dramatically advance device functionalities while reducing power consumption, size and weight of the enabled systems.  In addition to these attributes, we further illustrated the capability to integrate dissimilar materials.  Our study established fundamental understandings of a novel meta-stable growth mode that enable the integration of III-V compound semiconductors on a silicon substrate with 8% lattice mismatch.  This understanding serves as a basic platform for integration of many other dissimilar material systems.  We also demonstrate one unique and previously un-explored property of nanostructures for the first time, i.e. nanostructure facilitates single crystal growth on lattice mismatched substrates at low temperatures!\n\nThe outcome of this research will create a major impact towards the integration of optoelectronic devices, such as lasers, solar cells and photodetectors, on a silicon platform with CMOS integrated circuits.
