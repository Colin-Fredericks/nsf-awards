 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates a novel approach for measuring in-situ formation of peroxide and carbonates using carbon and oxygen triple isotopes to help elucidate heterogeneous chemical transformations on aerosol surfaces. The ozone molecule is unique isotopically as it possesses the highest enrichment (70-120%) in the heavier isotopes of oxygen and serves as a natural tracer of chemical reactions involving ozone interaction. Since hydrogen peroxide is formed on aerosol surfaces, O-triple isotopic measurements of the newly formed peroxide on aerosol surfaces in the laboratory with ozone, water, and CaO indicate that the transfer of anomaly from ozone to carbonates proceeds via peroxide. This project employs both night and daytime aerosol sampling (12h sampling) of ambient air in La Jolla CA to look for day/night differences in 13C and oxygen triple isotopic composition (17O and 18O) of atmospheric carbonates and hydrogen peroxide in coarse and fine fractions of aerosols. The isotopic analyses in this project will help elucidate the molecular-level details of the mechanisms of heterogeneous reactions at aerosol surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis effort will enhance our understanding of the radiative properties of aerosols, the role of oxygen isotopes in ice core data, impacts of aerosol transport to ecosystems, and health impacts of aerosols. The results will address the issue of thin films on aerosol surfaces while at the same time make progress in areas of importance to fundamental physical chemistry.",

In an urban environment, naturally occurring aerosols, however, are mixed with pollutants such as ozone, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, organic compounds and heavy metals from traffic pollution. This mixture of gases and particulate matter undergo physical and photochemical transformations, producing toxic aerosols. &nbsp;Despite stringent regulations, poor air quality in certain parts of the state of California has caused &nbsp;~ $2-3/- million losses annually in health care costs and missed work. The state of California also experiences a specific weather pattern called Santa Ana (extreme dry and hot conditions with relative humidity as low as 10%) followed by wild fires which are responsible for poor air quality. A clear link between higher ozone levels, particulate matter and adverse health effects (cardio-vascular and pulmonary diseases) has been confirmed in many regional and global studies, however, chemical composition and physical properties of these harmful particulate matter has never been investigated in detail. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The overall objective of this proposal was to understand physical and chemical transformations on aerosol surfaces in the presence of ozone and other toxic pollutants.

These studies confirmed that a very thin liquid layer (~nanometer) is required for the formation of gas and liquid phase hydroxy and hydroperoxyl radicals and their subsequent reactions. The oxidized products formed during this gas phase reaction on aerosol surfaces are extremely difficult to measure due to their extremely short life time (~ few seconds) and low concentrations. The use of high precision oxygen triple isotopic techniques allowed us to detect interactions of&nbsp;&nbsp;free radicals produced by the interaction of ozone on aerosols. Laboratory experiments and field work indicated that photocatalytic reactions on mineral surfaces such as copper oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide proceed through hole-pair charge transfer and lead to oxidation-reduction reactions on aerosols. The first step involves oxidation of surface adsorbed water on mineral surfaces to form hydroxyl ions and radicals. In a second step, atmospheric carbon dioxide or <em>in-situ</em> produced carbon dioxide reacts with hydroxyl groups to from bicarbonates which upon drying changes to carbonates.

Our data revealed a deep stratospheric intrusion in the upper troposphere and enhancement of ozone in the free troposphere.
