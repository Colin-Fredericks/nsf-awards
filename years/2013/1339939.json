 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Recruitment, Preparation, and Retention of Mathematics and Science Teachers project is a Phase II Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship project at the College of William and Mary (W&M).  It supports twenty-seven undergraduate and graduate majors in biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics, or physics in obtaining a teaching credential, as well as the opportunity to earn a Master's of Arts in Education degree. The program model provides early experiences and structured mentoring about careers in teaching.  It includes out-of-class opportunities and freshman-to-junior-year education course offerings to recruit students to teaching, STEM internships in teaching and research for Noyce Scholars, and courses for Noyce Scholars that supplement W&M's teacher education program.  Three different pathways into the profession of teaching are supported: a customary four-year baccalaureate program, an integrated \"fifth-year\" baccalaureate and M.A. Education Program, and a full-time, 12-month M.A. Education Program. \r\n\r\nThis Noyce Phase II project is testing a model for the many colleges and universities similar to W&M that face the dual challenges of low numbers of STEM students entering the teaching profession and being physically distant from high-need schools. Two issues for many institutions are: (1) sparking and developing an interest in a career in teaching in STEM students in the early undergraduate years, and (2) designing effective strategies for preparing students to teach in high-need schools.  In this project, immersive experiences in high need schools develops familiarity and provides opportunity for reflection and deeper understanding for undergraduates at the freshman to junior level.  A one-credit course for Noyce Scholars incorporates research findings from neuroscience and cognitive psychology to provide evidence-based, practical applications in STEM teaching and develops the ability of Noyce Scholars to evaluate new approaches to teaching.  A practicum course for Noyce Scholars provides experiences in high-need settings to develop competencies and confidence of Noyce Scholars to teach in high need schools.  \r\n\r\nThe College of William and Mary in partnership with the Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools works together to refine and expand the successful program developed during Phase I in several significant ways: (a) deepening collaborative engagement among STEM departments, the School of Education, and the W&M Office of Community Engagement, which educates and inducts students into practical, hands-on community service (b) developing a new program for recruiting and mentoring diverse, qualified students for a teaching career in high-need schools; (c) continuing to enhance the established teacher education program with special course offerings in STEM education and in science; (d) expanding experiences for W&M students in high-need schools and settings; (e) continuing to offer summer internships for STEM teaching and research; (f) providing student stipends to cover tuition and fees; (g) continuing to provide follow-up mentoring and support for teaching in high-need schools; (h) adding financial support for Noyce Scholars employed in high-need schools during their first two years of teaching; and (i) implementing a comprehensive evaluation and longitudinal study, inclusive of forty-three Phase I Noyce Scholars, to provide a rigorous evidence base for the program and publication.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project recruited and trained 45 new STEM teachers in science and mathematics certified to teach in grades 6-12.  The total of 45 teachers trained exceeded the 36 new teachers proposed originally in the grant submitted along with a supplement funded in 2017.  Of these 45 teachers, 15 are in Biology, 11 in Chemistry, 4 in Earth Science, 14 in Mathematics, and 1 in Physics.  Forty-four of these teachers have completed or are completing their formal requirement to teach in high need school districts.  In addition to rigorous preparation in courses in our School of Education, the project added early experiences in high need schools, with chances to meet teachers and administrators, followed by reflection and discussion on teaching STEM disciplines in high need schools.  A course specifically for this project, ?How Students Learn?, provided all of the teachers in preparation with an overview on the cognitive science of learning and memory from a biological perspective along with practical advice and exercises to make use of evidence-based research on learning and memory in the classroom.  The project also supported students in additional coursework to enhance the teaching of English-language learners in STEM disciplines. \n\nResearch supported and disseminated by the project included the following: (1) a publication on improving learning skills of students using sketching to help develop and apply mental models in STEM; (2) a jointly-supported doctoral dissertation between our program and the Virginia Commonwealth University Noyce program, finding that the two mechanisms employed for supporting and mentoring new teachers were effective, but the greatest factor affecting interest in continued teaching was administrative activities in the school systems of new teachers; (3) a publication identifying models for motivation to teach in high need schools.  The results suggested that three factors tended to support a motivation to teach in high need schools: a passion for the discipline, motivation to teach, and a sense that access to a high-quality education in STEM was an issue of equity and fairness.  In particular, students who felt strongly about the third factor were likely to be highly motivated to teach in high need schools.  \n\nThe project also developed a model of collaboration with the College of William &amp; Mary?s Office of Community Engagement.   In this model, students were offered early experiences in teaching or tutoring in high need settings, along with instruction and discussion of issues related to STEM education and access to STEM courses of high quality at the K-12 level.  Students who participated in these programs were a significant portion of the recruits for Noyce scholarships, and many became highly motivated to become teachers.\n\nIn addition to research results above, the project team presented over 20 conference presentations or workshops to share project materials or results.   These included sharing all materials from our project-specific courses, including a free pdf with readings for ?How Students Learn?, and copies of all assignments and handouts. \n\nThis project is continuing under new funding for an additional five years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Heideman"
