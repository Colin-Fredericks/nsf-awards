This award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of chiral tricyclic lactams; (b) characterization of non-heme iron nitrosyl complexes of biological importance; (c) development and application of unnatural amino acids to investigate enzyme function and dynamics; (d) characterization of gold nanoparticle-cored dendrimers for the treatment and imaging of cancer; (e) development of organophosphorus Alzheimer's therapeutics; and (f) the study of selective small molecule membrane transport.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research by undergraduate and master students at California State Long Beach University and students from two neighboring colleges.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Merit:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at CSULB (a primarily undergraduate serving institute, a minority serving institute and a hispanic serving institute) sought out a new NMR spectrometer to replace an aging instrument that no longer served the rapidly advancing needs of a vigorous department. At the time of application many new and highly innovative projects spanning many chemical disciplines were being explored by our PIs with their undergraduate and MS candidates. These included: new fluoride binders; non-heme iron nitrosyl complexes of biological importance; the application of unnatural amino acids to investigate enzyme function; the characterization of gold nanoparticles for the treatment and imaging of cancer; the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s therapeutics; and the study of selective small molecule membrane transport. With such programs ongoing our aging NMR infrastructure at the time could not meet either the sheer number of experiments nor the technical requirements of many individual experiments. Additionally, the training opportunities in NMR spectroscopy for our undergraduate researchers was very limited due to the single loading operation of our old instrument, along with a cumbersome scheduling system for one instrument that has high-demand, as well as a limited number of nuclei and 2D experiments.<br /><br />Impact:</p>\n<p>NSF MRI afforded the acquisition of a modern 400 MHz NMR with 24 station autosampler. Instantly this was transformative for our department. The installed instrument was fully automated, allowing users to drop off samples 24 hours a day without the need for reservations. Given that our undergraduates balance their coursework and research efforts all the time, a few minutes saved in access time has a big impact on their progress. Students do not have to wait for an instrument or come at odd hours, they simply &ldquo;walk on&rdquo; at any time. If the instrument is not running a sample they can typically receive data in as little as 4 minutes, if samples are being run, the next time they return to the instrument their data is waiting. All students are NOW trained to operate our NMR independently. This instrument greatly simplified the training protocol, the autosampler makes sample loading fast and safe. Our Department affords approximately 30 undergraduates and 10 M.S. candidates research opportunities on projects that rely on NMR annually. Students engage in research via research course work, training grants, internal awards, faculty support and volunteerism. An additional 12 students engage in research in the Bridges to the Baccalaureate program from two neighboring community colleges. The students using the instrument under the supervision of PIs and senior personnel have a strong record of undergraduate co-authored peer-reviewed papers, national conference presentations and external support. Faculty have also obtained competitive funding to promote student diversity through research training: NSF S-STEM (2010-), NSF CSU-LSAMP (1993-), Dept. of Ed. HSI-STEM (2011-16), NIHNIMHD H2OLA (2011-16), NIHMARC (1984-), NIHMBRS (1987-2001), NIHMIRT/MHIRT (1995-), NIHRISE (2004-) and NIHBUILD (2015-). CSULB&rsquo;s ethnic profile of undergraduates is one of the most diverse worldwide. The research opportunities the senior personnel provide have impact on health, technology and the environment and provide chemistry and biology students from our diverse community critically important opportunities to develop advanced skills - typically reserved for students in PhD programs. Our students are highly competitive for entry into the workforce or graduate program admission due to advanced research equipment use and training opportunities, exactly like the ones that this MRI award made possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Publications, Presentations, Theses:</p>\n<p>The first year of the award involved purchasing, installation, PI training, protocol development and then finally we were ready to train our students. The second and third year of the award resulted in more than 34 external (off campus) public presentations by our Senior Personnel, our MS candidates and primarily by our undergraduate researchers. 11 M.S. Theses were published that relied heavily on this new instrument, and 10 peer reviewed publications all having either MS or BS candidate co-authors have been accepted or are pending acceptance at this time. Many more publications are in the pipe-line and at this rate we expect a minimum of 5 publications per year that rely and cite this award for the foreseeable future. In this time period over 30 undergraduate students, over 12 graduate students, 1 post-doc and 3 faculty have been trained to use the instrument independently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schramm</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337559/1337559_10266278_1475354236442_IMG_10312--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337559/1337559_10266278_1475354236442_IMG_10312--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CSULB Bruker 400 MHz NMR with autosampler\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1337559/1337559_10266278_1475354236442_IMG_10312--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CSULB Bruker 400 MHz NMR with autosampler\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CSULB's NSF MRI funded Bruker 400 MHz Ascend Magnet with 24 station SampleCase autosampler.
