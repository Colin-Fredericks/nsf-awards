 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a comprehensive assessment of the glacier-permafrost-hydrology system in light of anticipated increases in glacier wastage and permafrost degradation with climate warming.   Current limited understanding of the integrated effects of glaciers and permafrost on terrestrial hydrology inhibits quantification of the impact of cryospheric changes on arctic water resources. Glaciers in permafrost landscapes feed and recharge aquifers in otherwise semi-arid lowlands, which despite relatively low precipitation rates, contain extensive wetlands.  The specific objectives of this study are to 1) assess the hydrologic pathways of glacier wastage within a watershed underlain by discontinuous permafrost through hydrologic and geochemical field measurements, 2) quantify the effect of glaciers and permafrost on recent historical (1960-present) hydrologic fluxes and storage by combining glacier mass balance, hydrologic, and geochemical field measurements with an existing heat- and mass transfer model that couples glacier mass balance to downstream hydrology, and 3) project the future hydrologic regime using custom-derived downscaled climate projections (5 km) for the Tanana River basin, Alaska.  The major products of the project will include a quantification of the controls that govern the hydrologic processes in glacier- and permafrost affected watersheds.",

Changes in streamflow present implications for river travel throughout the year and impact sea ice growth and nutrient exports to Arctic Ocean coastal waters. Processes responsible for increasing river discharge are debated because no single process can explain increases in runoff of several rivers. We showed that the ubiquitous mass loss from subarctic mountain glaciers feeds rivers not only in summer but also in the winter. We measured summer discharge at two places in the same glacier-fed headwater stream in Interior Alaska and found that the discharge is lower downstream that upstream. The difference represents water that is lost to infiltration into ground and subsequent aquifer recharge. The aquifer in turn feeds the larger lowland river, like the Tanana River, during winter. As such, glaciers across the semiarid regions can be important sources of water to streams and aquifers and an overlooked source of increasing river discharge reported across the Arctic. The research included training for seven students including field measurements in discharge and glacier mass balance, processing of measurements and presentations of the findings to colleagues and general public such at the Delta Annual Farm Forum in the town of Delta Junction, which is located near the field site.
