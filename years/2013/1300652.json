 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Don Coltart of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston will explore the development of approaches to the challenging and long-standing problem of\r\nasymmetric alpha-functionalization of ketones. The central hypothesis of the research is that activated hydrazones and oximes will provide the basis for a variety of new approaches to the asymmetric alpha-alkylation/functionalization of aldehydes and/or ketones.  For ketone derived systems, fundamentally new substitution patterns that cannot be generated using existing technology will be accessible in an asymmetric manner. For both aldehydes and ketones, it will be possible to conduct asymmetric alpha-alkylation/functionalization in an umploung sense relative to typical methods, thus enabling the incorporation of functionality that cannot be introduced using enolate based methods.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing more efficient methods for the preparation of complex organic molecules.  The methods that will be developed are designed to be very general, and will therefore be directly applicable to the asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of biologically important natural products, drugs, and related compounds. Consequently, they stand to find wide use by researchers in academic, government, and private sectors. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nN-amino cyclic carbamate chiral auxiliaries (ACCs) have been developed for asymmetric ketone a-alkylation and demonstrated their effectiveness in the asymmetric total synthesis of natural products.  This is now the best method available for effecting such transformations, and offers a number of advantages over conventional methods.  For instance, the auxiliaries are both easily introduced into and removed from ketones, with quantitative recovery.  Deprotonation is rapid, and alkylation does not require extreme low temperature (&ndash;20 &ordm;C), yet proceeds with excellent stereoselectivity.  ACCs also enable a fundamentally new type of alkylation that is not possible using any other methods.  This stems from their ability to actively participate in deprotonation through coordination to LDA, which we term complex induced syn-deprotonation (CIS-D), leading to deprotonation on the same side of the carbon&ndash;nitrogen double bond as the auxiliary.  This overrides the normal preference of LDA for the most sterically accessible proton, thus enabling the asymmetric sequential a,a&ndash;bisalkylation of ketones having a and a? protons, a useful yet previously unattainable reaction.  The method has been applied to the asymmetric total synthesis Apratoxin D and Clusianone.  We have also introduced the first catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reaction of N-sulfonyl azoalkenes as a means of effecting umpolung-based carbonyl a-alkylation, as well as the first organocatalytic enantioselective carbonyl a-sulfenylation method.  N-sulfonyl azoalkenes and related functional groups have received little attention to date but have considerable potential for the development of new and useful synthetic methods applicable to the synthesis of natural products, drugs, and related compounds.  To advance this line of research, initial studies on the trapping of 3-alkoxy-1-azopropenes (a type of azoalkene) were conducted, which led to what is by far the most broadly applicable method ever reported for the stereocontrolled a-alkylation of carbonyl compounds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Don M Coltart"
