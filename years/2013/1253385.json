 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Ivan Aprahamian of Dartmouth College develops easy to make, modular and tunable hydrazone-based switches, and studies ways to integrate them into polymers and liquid crystals.  This proposal offers a new strategy for the development of adaptive functional materials (such as chemically activated actuators, sensors and molecular machines) by using synthetically straightforward building blocks.  It is expected that this approach will facilitate the structure-property analysis of the systems, which will enable the rapid production of i) molecular machines for nanotechnology applications, ii) stimuli-responsive polymers that can convert chemical energy into mechanical motion, and iii) pH sensitive liquid crystals that can be used as sensors for environmental pollutants. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research entail i) using the ACS SEED project and other endeavors to retain students of different levels (high school, undergraduate and graduate students) in the sciences, ii) piloting and assessing classroom technologies that can augment the learning experience of students, and iii) developing hands-on self-assembly demonstrations to educate the general public about important concepts related to supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology.",
