Troy \tNorth Carolina State University \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to request Travel funds for graduate students  to attend  a Bioelectronics Tutorial Track in the emerging field of bioelectronics and to attend the 2013 IEEE Sensors Conference which is being held in Baltimore, MD. The tutorial will be held on Nov.3 and will involve leading experts in the field and will offer four interrelated tutorials , two in the morning and two in the afternoon. A motivational luncheon speaker will also be included. Travel expense reimbursements of $1000 will be made to each awardee. Travel expenses up to $1,000 will be awarded. The awardees will be  U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are not currently supported by an NSF ERC. The students will also attend the IEEE Sensors conference where many of the leaders in the field will be delivering lectures and presenting papers.\r\nThis will be an excellent opportunity for the students to get exposed to one of the major  emerging programs in science and engineering, will expose the student to many of the leaders in the field and will have an impact on their decision to continue In graduate studies. We will need all the manpower we can generate over the next few years in this field and this is an excellent way  for getting them on board. There is no doubt that many of them will be leaders in the future.\r\nBioelectronics is fundamental to interfacing of engineering and biology and advances in this field will lead to the solution of many of the problems facing our society  including genetic medicine, health care, environmental sensing, structural monitoring and homeland security. Thus advances in this field will have a tremendous societal impact.\r\nProf. Nagel has proposed an excellent program for this tutorial and conference attendance and I strongly support funding.\r\nThe budget is reasonable and the great majority of funds will go towards supporting the students. A small amount is allocated for support staff which is needed to administer the program which is supposed to include travel plans and other arrangements for 20 students.\r\nI therefore highly recommend support of this request\r\nFunding of $29,575 will be provided by:\r\nECCS-07010007-7564 (George Haddad)\r\nGeorge Haddad\r\nProgram Director (CCSS/ENG)",
