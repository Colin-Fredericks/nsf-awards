 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Martin T. Zanni of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and his graduate and undergraduate research students are investigating the chemical structures of molecules at interfaces.  They do this using heterodyne detected, two-dimensional, sum-frequency generation spectroscopy.  Specific molecules to be studied include small organometallic species and biomolecules.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the work by Professor Zanni and his group is to develop powerful new methods to probe the structure and behavior of complex molecules at interfaces.  Interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, including the surfaces of cells.  The development of experimental methods that are only sensitive to chemical species at the surface has been important in developing a better understanding of the chemistry in this unique milieu.   Along the way, Prof. Zanni will build a strong, interdisciplinary program in physical chemistry and will train a new generation of researchers for the technological workforce.",

We discovered that a peptide adopts a helical structure on a surface and that we could identify the regions that were disordered even though our spectroscopy shouldn't have been able to.  We also studied DNA on gold surfaces.  Segments of DNA are used as sensors, but their thermodynamics are altered on surfaces for reasons not entirely understood.  We published a very detailed strutural characterization, determining the angle and tilt of the DNA bands that extend from the surface.  Throughtout these experiments, we developed the theoretical understanding of this new spectroscopy and made improvements to is parent technique 2D IR spectroscopy as well.  Our efforts have helped to better understand the chemistry of molecular binding at interfaces and helped to create a state-of-the-art technique to be used by scientists worldwide.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin T Zanni"
