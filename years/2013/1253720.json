 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nObjective: The objective of this program is to demonstrate a non-polar nitride cascade laser to fill the need for ultra-fast compact light sources tunable by design in the entire underutilized near-infrared range. The approach eliminates the adverse effects of built-in polarization fields in nitrides by engineering quantum charge-transport along the polarization-free direction perpendicular to the m-plane of GaN.\r\nIntellectual merit: The main scientific contribution is to elucidate the impact of built-in polarization fields on the performance of nitride near-infrared lasers and detectors. The program will enable a new class of versatile and ultra-fast optoelectronic devices that will immediately trigger practical applications. The novel near-infrared devices will facilitate compact, affordable consumer systems and could eventually surpass the commercial success of the blue nitride lasers.\r\nBroader impacts: The program will increase exposure of Grade 7-12 students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Central Indiana to the scientific content and method of photonics. A comprehensive progression of inquiry-based outreach activities was designed to maximize impact across multiple age groups. Secondary science teachers will develop and pilot lesson plans and demonstrations that incorporate concepts of infrared radiation into the high-school curriculum. Engaging hands-on activities for a science summer camp for middle-school girls will be developed and implemented. Special attention will be given to assessing the impact of these activities on the development of knowledge about the science content related to invisible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The integrated educational plan will leverage existing web-based tools on Purdue's nanoHUB.org for dissemination across the global research community.",

Our innovative approach eliminated the adverse effects of built-in (piezoelectric and spontaneous) polarization fields in nitrides by engineering quantum charge-transport along the polarization-free [1-100] direction using heterostructures grown on m-plane GaN substrates. Basic mechanisms of material growth such as adatom kinetics and impurity incorporation on polar and non-polar GaN substrates have been studied in detail and compared to achieve adequate understanding and control of the growth process, resulting microstructure and infrared optical properties. The research program also gave opportunities for major contributions to the understanding of the physics of optical transitions in nitride materials.
