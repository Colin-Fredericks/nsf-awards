 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellctual Mert: The DNA of the eukaryotic genome is packaged by association with the histones and other chromosomal proteins into alternative forms: the more condensed form, heterochromatin, inhibits gene expression while a more open form, euchromatin, facilitates gene expression.  Eukaryotic genomes have been greatly expanded over evolutionary time by the retention of repetitious sequences, primarily copies of transposable elements (DNA transposons and retroviruses - TEs).  Where these sequences are present at high density, they are packaged as heterochromatin, inhibiting expression of these elements.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand how genes can be expressed from a domain with high levels of silenced repetitious sequence.  Work in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has shown that many genes normally resident in euchromatin exhibit a variegating phenotype (due to silencing of the gene in some of the cells where it should be active) when inserted into heterochromatin by rearrangement or transposition.  The small fourth chromosome (Muller F element), which is largely heterochromatic, contains ~80 genes, both housekeeping and developmentally regulated genes.  In higher eukaryotes, specifically mammals, the long chromosome arms that contain genes appear to be structured like the F element, with ~30% TE repeats. Thus how genes can function in this environment, while repetitious elements are silenced, is a general issue.  The goal here is to understand the combination of characteristics that enables fourth chromosome genes to function in a chromatin context where euchromatic genes variegate (are silenced).  The investigators postulate the presence of one or more key sequence features or motifs organizing and/or protecting the fourth chromosome genes.  To test this hypothesis, they will identify 'landing pad' sites in the D. melanogaster fourth chromosome where a fourth chromosome gene is appropriately expressed, but an hsp70-white gene gives a variegating phenotype, and test whether this is determined by the 5' region of the gene (the transcription start site with ~1 kb flanking sequence, both upstream and downstream).  Establishing this system will allow one to identify the minimal features that can drive full expression of any reporter in a fourth chromosome heterochromatic site.  As a complement to this work, the investigators plan to use an in silico approach to find sequences in other species that are similar to the sequences identified in the D. melanogaster F element.  This comparative bioinformatics approach will be facilitated by carrying out ChIP-seq experiments to find binding sites for RNA polymerase II (marking the start site for transcription) in two Drosophila species which are at a suitable evolutionary distance for finding sequence motifs, D biarmipes and D. elegans. By testing the findings gained from one approach with the methodology of the other approach, the investigators expect to gain a better understanding of the global regulation of different chromosomal regions and of the sequence elements needed to drive expression of genes in heterochromatin.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project is a collaborative effort with the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP), a group of over 80 faculty who are using Drosophila genomics to bring students into the research community. The GEP undergraduate students will be responsible for generating high quality annotations for the genes on the Muller F elements of D. biarmipes and D. elegans. The student annotations will facilitate the search for common features/motifs on the F element using a comparative genomics approach.  Undergraduates will also take charge of looking at the impact of Su(var) and E(var) mutations on various reporters, testing sensitivity of the \"synthetic fourth chromosome gene\" constructs to mutations in appropriate chromosomal proteins. The postdoctoral fellow supported here will become an integral member of GEP, and will become very skilled at working with undergraduates in a research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Drosophila fourth chromosome: gene expression in the context of repetitious DNA (1243724).\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The DNA in our cells is not present simply as a double helix, but is packaged up with basic proteins known as histones to form a \"chromatin\" fiber.  Most genes are packaged in a looser form that allows for gene expression (\"euchromatin\"), while other regions, particularly those with a high density of repetitious DNA, are packaged in a denser from that generally silences transcription (\"heterochromatin\").   The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has an unusual chromosome, the F element, that appears to be entirely packaged as heterochromatin, but contains ca. 80 genes that are transcribed at levels similar to genes that reside in euchromatin.  How does it do that?  To find out, we have identified a fly line with a \"landing pad\" site where we can insert different genes into the same location on the F element.  When we insert a gene that normally resides in euchromatin, hsp70-white, it variegates &mdash; it is silent in many of the cells in which it would normally be active (see Figure 1).  We have shown that this eye phenotype is due to heterochromatin formation at the hsp70-white transgene.  By contrast, when we insert a gene that normally resides in heterochromatin on the F element, Rad23, it shows uniform gene expression.  We are now in a position to create hybrid transgenes, swapping parts between the hsp70-white euchromatic and the Rad23 heterochromatic gene. Our goal is to identify those DNA fragments that are necessary and sufficient to allow the hsp70-white gene to overcome the heterochromatin environment and be fully expressed on the F element.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that the most importance differences between the euchromatic and heterochromatic genes are located in the region surrounding the Transcription Start Site.  The difference might be in the way that the DNA sequence is organized, or in the number and kind of binding sites for transcription factors that regulate gene expression.  If these sites are important, they are likely to be conserved among species.  Looking for conserved elements within sequences from multiple species is called \"phylogenetic footprinting.\"  Broader Impacts:  To help with this part of the project, the faculty and students of the Genomics Education Partnership (http://gep.wustl.edu) have been improving the DNA sequence data and carefully annotating the genes on the heterochromatic F element (and a euchromatic region on the D element for comparison) from several Drosophila species that diverged from a common ancestor 10 to 15 million years ago.  Work on Drosophila biarmipes has been completed, while work on Drosophila elegans and Drosophila ficusphila is continuing.  These carefully annotated genes will be used in a bioinformatics search for enriched motifs.  The students (who are undergraduates at universities, colleges, and community colleges from across the USA) are paying special attention to identifying the Transcription Start Sites.  The project introduces students to bioinformatics while engaging them in a genomics research project.  Over 1000 students are involved with the GEP project at some level each year.\n\nSynergy:  This project is continuing with support from NSF (grant 1517266).  When we identify key heterochromatin gene features in the gene swap experiments, we will ask the undergraduates to look for these features, and when the bioinformatics analyses based on the student work suggests critical motifs, we will test these motifs using the gene swap system.  We hope to identify the signals that are necessary and sufficient to allow full, uniform expression of the hsp70-white transgene on the F element, in a heterochromatic environment.  Successful completion of this project will enhance our understanding of how genes are regulated, and help us design new tools to correct genes that are being abnormally regulated, as occurs in cancer and many other health pr..."
