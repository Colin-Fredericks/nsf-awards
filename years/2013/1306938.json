 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the chemistry of layered transition metal oxides in order to better understand catalyst-support interactions and to develop improved materials for electrochemical energy storage.  Both aspects of the research exploit the fact that nanosheets, as two dimensional crystals, are good building blocks for materials with designed structures and emergent properties. One part of the project builds on the discovery that nanoparticles of certain metals and metal oxides have anomalously high stability when supported on metal oxide nanosheets.  Calorimetry, electron microscopy, and X-ray scattering and absorption are being used to characterize the interfacial bonding. The primary goal of this part of the project is to map the periodic trends in bonding between late transition metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and early transition metal nanosheets. A second part of the project explores new synthetic routes to electroactive transition metal oxides. Topochemical reactions produce anhydrous, three-dimensionally bonded oxides in the form of nanoplates, which can be synthesized in the presence of graphene sheets to make a shuffled deck of conducting and electroactive \"cards.\"  Metal ions in the composites are in close contact with both the conducting graphene layers and the electrolyte that permeates them, and thus the materials have very good cyclability as supercapacitor and battery electrodes.  These materials are being studied by a combination of X-ray scattering and absorption, electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the synthesis of new materials that exploit the synergistic properties of nanoparticles.  Understanding and controlling the stabilization of metal nanoparticles can have an important impact in heterogeneous catalysis.  New synthetic routes to composites of oxide nanosheets and conducting graphene can also inform the development of secondary batteries that use more abundant, less expensive materials and have much longer cycling life.  These research projects are integrated with the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as with outreach programs that provide hands-on research experiences for high school teachers and for K-12 students from disadvantaged school districts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  Heterogeneous catalysts are solid materials that speed up chemical reactions through the interactions of molecules with their surface.  The catalysts themselves are not used up in these reactions, and they are vital to chemical processes that power, supply, and feed the world.  These processes include the manufacture of fuel, plastics, and chemicals from crude oil, the cleanup of automobile exhaust gases, and the synthesis of fertilizer from natural gas, water, and air.  A key problem with heterogeneous catalysts is the \"ripening\" of the nanoscale metal particles that are their active component.  At the high temperatures of catalytic reactions, tiny metal particles tend to grow larger, and fewer of their atoms are then available on the particle surface for catalytic reactions.  Certain kinds of support materials can stabilize catalytic metal particles against ripening, but 40 years after the discovery of this effect, the chemical mechanism has not been understood.\n\n \n\nIn this project, layered metal oxides were used as model surfaces for understanding how the metal-support interaction works.  Layered solids have a \"lasagna\" structure, in which molecularly thin sheets are stacked up.  We have developed reactions for chemically peeling these layers apart, making suspensions of nanosheets that are hundreds to thousands of nanometers wide but only about one nanometer thick.  Because they are thin, the nanosheets and particles on them can be easily imaged by electron microscopy and interrogated at the atomic level by spectroscopic methods.  The high surface area of the nanosheets also enables us to measure the bonding energy between them and and metal ions we add in a calorimeter.  This gives us information about how strongly support and catalyst particles from different parts of the periodic table interact with each other. \n\n \n\nUsing these methods, we mapped the trends in bonding energy and nanoparticle stability across the relevant parts of the periodic table.  The results were compared with total energy calculations done by numerically solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the materials in question.  From these calculations we learned that electrons in the metal d-orbitals &ndash; the highest energy electrons in the metal particles &ndash; are the \"glue\" that provides extra stability for certain metal-support combinations.  This finding is important not only for the design of more stable catalysts, but also for other applications where chemical bonds at the metal/metal oxide interface are important for strong adhesion.  Two such applications are in medical implants and microelectronics technology.\n\n \n\nThis project also involves studies of adhesion of inorganic nanosheets and polymers to lithium metal, and to lithium-silicon alloys.  These materials are used in rechargeable lithium batteries.  The lifetime of the battery &ndash; i.e., the number of times it can be charged and discharged &ndash; depends on chemical bonding at that interface.  The chemistry developed in this project in preliminary testing showed improved stability and cyclability for lithium batteries.\n\n \n\nBroader impact:  This project trained graduate and undergraduate students in a combined experimental/computational project that built expertise in materials synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, and computation. The outreach activities of the project provided hands on research experience for high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds and also provided a research experience for high school teachers. \n\n \n\nThis project also established collaborations with other chemists in the U.S. with complementary expertise, as well as with experts in the chemistry of layered materials in Japan, China, Brazil, and Chile.  The exchange of students from our laboratory with senior research personnel from abroad leveraged our NSF support for this project and provided our students with an international research experience in some of the best laboratories in the world in the area of layered materials.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas E Mallouk"
