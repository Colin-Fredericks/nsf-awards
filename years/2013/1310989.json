 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for high temperature optimal superconductors is motivated by the immense impact such discoveries would have on the electrical power transmission and storage, transportation, communication systems etc. This elaborate effort thrives on the availability of experts scientists, combining skills from materials synthesis to complex electronic, magnetic and structural characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for junior researchers to attend a joint US-China Winter School on Superconductivity held in Hong Kong January 21-23, 2013. The workshop will feature attendance and invited talks by many prominent scientists from both United States and China. By bringing young scientists together for the winter school, they will have a unique opportunity to learn about the century-long history of superconductivity, as well as experimental and theoretical developments both in the context of conventional and unconventional superconductors. The interactions are likely to catalyze future collaborations between graduate and postdoctoral students from US and China, two of the most active and successful communities currently involved in the search for optimal superconductors.",
