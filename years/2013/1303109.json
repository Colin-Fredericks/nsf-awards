 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference MEGA 2013 will take place at Goethe University in Frankfurt,Germany during June 3-7, 2013. MEGA is the acronym for Effective Methods in Algebraic Geometry (and its equivalent in Italian, French, Spanish, German, Russian, etc.). This series of biennial international conferences, with the tradition dating back to 1990, is devoted to computational and application aspects of Algebraic Geometry and related topics. Classical subareas include computational commutative algebra (Gr\u00f6bner and standard bases theory), methods for solving systems of polynomial equations, toric geometry, and the development of computer algebra systems as well as of numerical polynomial system solvers. MEGA 2013 will also present state-of-the art coverage of new effective paradigms, as well as of applications of algebraic geometry, including real algebraic geometry and optimization, tensor decompositions, the interplay between algebraic geometry and randomness, algebraic number theory, toric and tropical geometry and its interaction with the theory of lattice polytopes, and applications to algebraic statistics. The proposed workshop has the goal to familiarize researchers within the community and beyond with the most recent developments, to intensify existing and initiate new collaborations, and to sustain and broaden the existing mentoring network within the field.\r\n\r\nThe conference will have 9 invited talks, around 30 contributed talks, a poster session and a software presentation. The list of plenary speakers, selected by the organizers, includes senior as well as young promising researchers and two leading female mathematicians working in the field. The contributed talks and poster presenters will be selected by a highly competitive refereed selection process among all the submissions to the conference. Around 200 participants are expected to attend, including around 50 from under-represented groups. Participants from U.S. institutions will have valuable opportunities to present their work to an international audience of peers. This will enable them to discuss their own work and start collaborations that may have significant future impact on their careers and on algebraic geometry. To disseminate the results of the workshop to a wider audience, abstracts, slides, and notes from the presentations and discussions will be placed on the conference's website. Finally, following the tradition of MEGA, conference proceedings will be published as a special issue of a prestigious journal.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found on the conference website http://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/mega2013/",
