 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exchange of individuals among populations, termed connectivity, is a central element of population persistence and maintenance of genetic diversity, and influences most ecological and evolutionary processes.  To date, field studies of marine connectivity have necessarily focused on one or a few species at a time, providing little understanding of both the extent of variability in connectivity across a whole community and what factors drive that variability. This project will address these questions with population genetic datasets of a diverse marine fauna sampled across the Hawaiian Archipelago.  By combining these genetic data with extensive oceanographic, ecological and historical data, this project can potentially transform our understanding of the basis of the genetic structure of populations and the processes influencing genetic patterns. This project will provide unique, and new, knowledge to basic marine ecology and the science of Ecosystem Based Management while incorporating the latest analytical and simulation approaches. \r\n\r\nThe results will be novel on several fronts: 1) advancing our understanding of community genetics and associated statistical techniques; 2) achieving true integration of genetic, ecological and oceanographic data over large spatial scales for many species simultaneously using a World Heritage Site; the Hawaiian Papah\u00e2naumoku\u00e2kea Marine National Monument; 3) factoring historical effects into connectivity studies; and 4) providing information on the location of barriers to connectivity, the sources and sinks of individuals and the physical processes influencing ecological patterns at a community level.  This project will result in a quantum leap for both the conceptual and empirical understanding of marine connectivity and the utility of population genetic data in basic and applied marine science. \r\n\r\nThis project will also provide unique insights for both management and the general public through an established science-management partnership that reaches >14,000 people annually, a radio talk show, and through exhibits at the Waikiki Aquarium and Telus World of Science Center that is expected to reach over 800,000 visitors each year.  Additionally, the University of Hawaii has one of the most culturally diverse campuses in the country from which to draw students and assistants.  The principal investigators have an established track record of recruiting minority students, and this project will develop a combination of skills in molecular genetics, quantitative analysis, statistics, and landscape genetic techniques to further their career options in STEM disciplines.",

We compiled the most extensive co-sampled multispecies connectivity dataset (66 species, ranging from corals and lobsters to fishes and dolphins) to ask: 1) what shared patterns of genetic connectivity emerge when examining the diverse set of species co-sampled across the Hawaiian Archipelago? 2) What are the factors driving these shared patterns of exchange that can inform resource management? 3) Do genetic, oceanographic and ecological measures of connectivity agree within or across species? And 4) Do historical bottlenecks from sea level change impact genetics consistently to result in shared patterns of genetic structure in the majority of species?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We show that there are 4 primary categories of population structure (panmixia, isolation-by-distance, chaotic and regional population structure), and that these common categories encompass all 66 species of coral reef organisms regardless of life history or taxonomy (Selkoe et al. 2014). We further show, using a seascape genetics approach, that genetic diversity correlates with species diversity, and that large areas of intact reef with high coral cover harbor more genetic diversity than fragmented or degraded reefs (Selkoe et al. 2016). We created the first oceanographic dispersal models for the entire Hawaiian Archipelago and showed that biophysical models predict the location of genetic breaks in the unpopulated low islands and atolls of protected Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, but not in the heavily populated high islands of the Main Eight (Wren et al. 2016). &nbsp;Finally, we find that contrary to the hypothesis that most coral reef species should show population expansion as sea level recovered after the last glacial maximum approximately 18,000 years ago, only about half of the species in Hawai?i match this expectation. These results imply that management of large, intact, and undisturbed areas of coral reef habitat is able to conserve both species and genetic biodiversity. Further, contrary to the single archipelagic management strategy advocated by State and Federal Agencies at the outset of this project, these studies have shown limited dispersal among adjacent islands in the Hawaiian Archipelago (particularly in the populated Main Hawaiian Islands), supporting a transition to island-specific management and a growth of community managed areas. We further show that despite the fact that resource managers rarely consider genetic information explicitly, it can fundamentally change conservation priorities (Beger et al. 2014).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts:</span></strong> In sum, this project has supported four Pacific Islanders, two female post-docs, four female graduate students, and two soft-money female faculty members; we have successfully placed one female student into a permanent agency position (NOAA), two of the post-docs into tenure-track faculty positions and all three of our undergraduate interns (1 Native Hawaiian) have successfully gone on to graduate school placement.&nbsp; We trained 3 post-docs (2 into faculty positions), 5 graduate students (2 completed dissertations), and 3 undergraduates (2 senior theses) under this project.
