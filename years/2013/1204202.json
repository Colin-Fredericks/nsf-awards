The goal will be accomplished through a suite of four summer schools for groups of about 15-20 graduate students, as well as development of online course materials. Each course will consist of a classroom component and, more importantly, field experiences, hands-on activities/mini-projects, and presentations designed for communication to a broader general audience. Systematic pre- and post- surveys will provide metrics of summer school success.",
