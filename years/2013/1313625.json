 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This program focuses on the development of a novel class of p-type conductive and highly reflective AlGaN-based distributed Bragg reflectors to enable a host of deep ultraviolet optoelectronic devices, including efficient deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes, vertical-cavity-surface-emitting-lasers, and Fabry-Perot based optical modulators. The proposed project is transformative because it will create the foundations for a new family of efficient deep ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and will usher a host of new industrial applications including water / air / food sterilization and free space communications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed project is the utilization of polarization enhanced ionization of dopants, a unique property to AlGaN alloys, to develop an innovative design of deep ultraviolet distributed Bragg reflectors for a number of optoelectronic devices. The work will also advance the development of AlGaN alloys, which are of great scientific and technological interest.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research promotes the promotion of education through the training of students in a variety of disciplines, ranging from epitaxial growth, to quantum engineering, and semiconductor device physics. To increase the effectiveness and scope of the program, the involvement of undergraduates and high-school interns will be emphasized by taking advantage of several existing channels at Boston University, many of which have a strong focus on the recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Finally, the proposed research will have a strong impact on the environmental and medical sectors, due to specific applications to water / air / food sterilization and for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.",
