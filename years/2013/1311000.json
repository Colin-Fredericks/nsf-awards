 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Josef B. Stiegler of The George Washington University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China.  The project title is \"The Anatomy and Evolutionary Relationships of a Peculiar Dinosaur from Wucaiwan (Xinjiang, People's Republic of China).\"  The host scientist is Xu Xing.\r\n\r\nThe theropod dinosaur Limusaurus inextricabilis is a basal ceratosaur of uncertain relationships from the Jurassic Shishugou formation of Xinjiang. Its highly reduced, four-fingered hand has undergone bilateral digital reduction, a condition previously unknown in Mesozoic theropods but known to be present in the three-fingered hands of birds via embryological evidence. This project documents the skeletal anatomy of Limusaurus, in order to resolve its relationships within Ceratosauria. Should it occupy a basal position within the clade, it may provide evidence for a frameshift in digit identity in the most recent common ancestor of Limusaurus and more derived theropods (including birds), or that ancestor's stem lineage.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the evolution of dinosaurs is a topic of great interest to the public and is often introduced to children at a young age. Given the potential for this project to resolve a conflict between paleontological and embryological evidence regarding the evolution of the hand along the lineage leading to modern birds, it may provide further opportunities to engage the public with science and an accessible example of evolutionary-developmental biology (evo-devo) for science education. Data and educational materials related to this project will be publicly available via the Morphobank website upon publication of the results.",
