The target population for this project is African Americans and Hispanic students. The community colleges within the Alliance are: Valencia College, a designated Hispanic Serving Institution, fiscal agent and project lead, (VC), Lake-Sumter State College (LSSC), and Seminole State College of Florida (SSC). This project will expand and focus efforts toward building a system and infrastructure for URM students in STEM majors. This project will focus efforts to increase the transfer rate of underrepresented minorities through focused efforts including: 1) providing clear and targeted advising; 2) providing information about STEM fields and career opportunities; 3) encouraging their projective identity as a STEM professional; and 4) increasing opportunities for students to conduct research.",
