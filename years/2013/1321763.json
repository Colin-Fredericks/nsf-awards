 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern deformation between the North American and Pacific plates is distributed across a wide zone of western North America from the San Andreas fault eastward into the western Basin and Range Province. The eastern Mojave Desert and the region between the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin form a zone of distributed deformation that accommodates about 25 percent of the relative motion between the Pacific and North American plates. Deformation to the south is localized within the Eastern California Shear Zone and to the north in the Walker Lane Belt, which today is characterized by northwest-trending faults with associated earthquake focal mechanisms and GPS velocities that are indicative of transtensional deformation. This project tests the hypothesis that deformation associated with the transtensional system during the early to mid-Miocene was located east of the Sierra Nevada front in the area of the Mono Basin prior to stepping east into the Mina Deflection in the late Miocene. To do so the research team is carrying out a detailed paleomagnetic study of the Oligocene to Pliocene mafic to intermediate lava flows, rhyolitic ignimbrites, sediments in the Mono Basin area (Huntoon Valley, Adobe Hills, Antelope Mountains, Cowtrack Mountains) to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of vertical axis rotation. Field structural studies coupled with 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of volcanic and intrusive rocks are used to constrain the fault geometry, kinematics, magnitude of fault slip, and the timing of deformation.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern California Shear Zone and Walker Lane Belt, a zone that stretches from the Mojave Desert to northern California/northwestern Nevada, are important fault systems that accommodate a substantial portion of the motion of between the North American and Pacific plates, with most of the motion taken up by the San Andreas fault. However, the tectonic evolution of this complex fault zone remains poorly understood. This project aims to resolve an important part of the puzzle in that it would contribute to a better understanding of how deformation shifts through time. The project has a significant component of student involvement. Improving students' technological and basic science skill-sets will train and foster research endeavors for minority and underrepresented students.",

Based on a variety of data, the San Andreas Fault system accommodates ~70-75% of the total relative motion between the North American and Pacific plates. The residual 25% - 30% is transferred away from the San Andreas Fault system via several fault systems into the region east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Our study goals were to use a variety of geological techniques to map the deformation east of the Sierra Mountain front in the area of the Mono Basin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: The intellectual merit<strong> </strong>of this proposal concerns a principal question in continental dynamics with regards to how faulting is accommodated spatially and temporally. The eastern Mono Lake Basin is located between two regions with dramatically different mechanisms for transferring motion between subparallel strike-slip faults and connecting faults. What are the mechanisms by which generally NE-striking faults transfer slip from the south out of Death Valley into the Mono Lake Basin? Is slip transfer dominated by strike-slip faulting, rotation of fault bounded crustal blocks, or some combination of the two mechanisms? What factors controls the mechanism by which slip is transferred? When did faulting and possible block rotation initiate in the present-day Mono Lake Basin? &nbsp;The research methods we used in the study did not answer all of these questions, yet the data sets allow us to place limitations on the mechanism of slip transfer in the region, constrain the timing of when the system developed, and helped constrain the timing of intraplate reorganization. In addition, this study provides fundamental data on the geology of the region (geologic maps, remote sensing databases, structural kinematic data), place volcanic eruptions into a temporal framework (<sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar), advance the understanding of the types of rocks in the region (petrologic study), and collectively provide data that can be used by other geologists to further develop regional models of intracontinental deformation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU) is a historically Hispanic institution committed to programs that focus on its multiethnic student body (76% minority students), especially the Hispanic and Native American cultures that are distinctive of northern New Mexico. This research project directly supported one graduate student, two laboratory technicians (both minorities), six minority undergraduate students, and provided a focused learning environment to train dominantly underrepresented students in the use of field methods, geographic information system technologies (GIS), microscope (petrographic) techniques, absolute age determinations (geochronology), and specialized paleomagnetic instrumentation. NMHU is located in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the country. Its students are among those targeted by NSF for increasing representation in the STEM fields. Improving students' technology and basic science skill-sets will serve the NSF directorate to train and foster research endeavors for minority and underrepresented students and serve NMHU's mission to increase research and scholarship capacity to a considerably underserved region of the state. This project has aided with recruiting and maintaining strong collaborative research with nearby institutions (e.g., Sul Ross State University, TX), has fostered a strong collaborative endeavor between a dominantly minority undergraduate institution (NMHU) and a world-renowned PhD program (New Mexico Institute of Technology).
