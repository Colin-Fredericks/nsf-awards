 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides partial support for a conference on Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) to be held in late 2013 or early in 2014. The conference lasts two days and engages about 200 faculty members, most in physics, including physics education research, along with biologists, biology education researchers, basic science medical school faculty, and other health-related faculty. The conference is expected to result in a report to the undergraduate STEM community about how physics is responding to the calls for innovation in undergraduate life science education as articulated in the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science report on Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the report on the Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians produced by a joint Howard Hughes Medical Institute-Association of American Medical Colleges committee, and the Preview Guide to MCAT2015, the revised Medical College Admission Test. In addition the report provides guidelines for IPLS courses that serve a wide spectrum of life science students including those aiming for health-related careers, for basic biological sciences research careers (as articulated in the BIO2010 report from the National Research Council), for future K-12 life science teachers, and for those in fields such as ecology and environmental science.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the project lies in its comprehensive discussion of what physics should be taught to undergraduate life science students and how it should be taught based on what is known from physics education research and biology education research. The project is led by a team with considerable experience in physics education for the life sciences.  That team is aided by a conference planning group that includes physicists, biologists representing the breadth of contemporary biology, and disciplinary education researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of the project include a set of guidelines that lead to the enhancement of the introductory physics courses for the life sciences taken by about 200,000 students per year and the materials, both text and online, and laboratory experiments used by those students. Special efforts are being made to involve all types of higher education institutions and to ensure the participation of faculty from minority-serving institutions by using personal recruitment and by providing some travel subsidies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn March 2014 the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) with support from the National Science Foundation hosted the Conference on Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS). The purpose of the conference was to discuss ways to improve introductory physics courses taken by life science students, to make recommendations to the physics community to make IPLS courses more effective, and to nurture and expand the IPLS community, a network of faculty and administrators working to enhance IPLS courses. Through discussions in working groups and reflection on the plenary talks, the 161 participants (mostly physics faculty members with a few biology and chemistry faculty members) developed the following recommendations, which constitute the Intellectual Merit of the project:\n\n The IPLS course should, at its core, be a physics course.  The structure of the course should be organized by key physics principles.  \"Thinking like a physicist\" skills (e.g. modeling, problem solving, estimating, using multiple representations, using data and theory to inform each other) should be taught and practiced. \n\n This physics backbone must be informed by the needs of life scientists, both in what topics are covered and what biology applications are presented. Working with local life scientists and biophysicists, therefore, is essential to making meaningful reform.   Developing a deep connection to the life sciences will maximize the impact this course has on the careers and thinking of life science students.\n\n The course needs to be built on best pedagogical practices.  Over the past two decades science educators have learned a great deal about how to improve teaching and learning in introductory courses.  This wealth of expertise tells us that making the content more relevant is critical but, by itself, not sufficient to ensure deep learning.\n\n To ensure that planned reforms are carried through and sustained, the whole department must be involved at some level.  The department should work toward facilitating faculty consensus on goals for this course, how to assess those goals, and how to reform the course so that those goals are likely to be achieved. \n\n The national IPLS community should support IPLS reform work by providing an online database of curricular resources and assessments, workshops and talks at AAPT conferences and other venues, and creating an on-line community.   There has also been a call for AAPT guidelines on IPLS topical coverage, and IPLS textbooks, and how to make the case for IPLS and reform.\n\n In addition, several challenges were identified by the conference participants:\n\n There is a wide diversity of IPLS students.  The needs of students studying microbiology vary greatly from those who are studying physical therapy.  Students also differ in mathematics, chemistry, and biology background.  These differences must be taken into account as IPLS courses are transformed.  Also, at many institutions, the course for life science students is often taken by students with many majors not in the life sciences.  One implication is that there is no \"one-size-that-fits-all\" IPLS course.  This diversity of courses makes the development of assessment tools that can be widely used particularly challenging.\n There are epistemological differences between biology and physics that both scientists and educators must navigate.  In particular, biological systems are often irreducibly complex while physicists often employ very simple models.  Also, physics tends to be more quantitative than the life sciences.  Conversely, biology uses qualitative evidence about the complexity of living systems more broadly and with greater strength than physics tends to.  Physics course reformers, with the help of life science colleagues, need to be aware of these differences in the design of course outcomes and course activities.\n Broader Impacts:  As a community, we have already taken many steps toward IPLS course reform and the IPLS conference wa..."
