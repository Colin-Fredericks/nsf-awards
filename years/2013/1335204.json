 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this collaborative project is to investigate high cycle fatigue failure in representative engineering alloys (304 austenitic stainless steel, Inconel 718+ Ni-based superalloy and Ti-6Al-4V alloy) with a tightly integrated modeling/experimental approach. A computational framework will be established based on the integration of an enriched space-time finite element method and a multiscale fatigue damage model. With this approach, new knowledge will be gained through studies on key factors such as load cycles, stress history and triaxiality, nonlinear coupling among the loads, and complex geometry, which are known to critically influence the fatigue failure and generally not fully accounted for in the empirical design approaches that are being practiced today. The fundamental mechanisms revealed through the computational efforts will be verified and validated through existing experimental data as well as proposed high cycle fatigue tests featuring in-situ monitoring of fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Additionally, microstructural characterization will be performed to establish a map between the observed microstructural deformation mechanism and the proposed multiscale material model.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will shed new night on the fundamental mechanisms that govern the high cycle fatigue failure in many critical engineering applications. Examples include turbines used for energy and power applications, aerospace structural components, and high-performance electronics. The multiscale simulation models and experimental techniques developed from this project will also be of interest to other researchers who are studying high cycle fatigue mechanism for a broader range of materials and devices. The acquired research results on the topic of high cycle fatigue will be fully incorporated into the undergraduate/graduate curricula. With a cyber-enabled approach, the knowledge will be disseminated through a variety of channels towards a wide range of audiences, including graduates, undergraduates, K-12 and underrepresented groups.",

While HCF dominates the application of many critical engineering components and structures, current design practices are heavily empirical in nature and often lead to designs that are either overly conservative or unsafe. The proposed approach embodies the key notion of multiple temporal scales that are associated with HCF applications, and further incorporates a multiscale material model that accounts for the progressive damage evolution as a result of the cyclic loads. The established simulation tool has been extensively verified and validated through collaborative efforts with experimental group at the University of Cincinnati. Implementations on various high performance computing (HPC) have also been developed to enable practical application of HCF life prediction tool. A tightly integrated educational and outreach program was also established as part of the project objectives. More specifically, this project has provided training opportunities for 5 graduate students and one has obtained his PhD degree and is currently working at a major manufacturing company. In addition, 5 undergraduate students participated in the summer research and one high school student was recruited through the UTD STEM program. The research results generated from this project have been incorporated in a number of core undergraduate and graduate courses. For instance, undergraduate students have been assigned with final project on design of wind turbines based on considerations of high cycle fatigue. In addition to the continuous improvements on the curriculum, the research results have also been disseminated through an edited book, conference presentations, departmental seminar and peer-referred publications in high-quality journals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dong&nbsp;Qian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938085992_outcome_pic1_modelvalidation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938085992_outcome_pic1_modelvalidation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Application of HCF for metals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938085992_outcome_pic1_modelvalidation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Application of HCF for metals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Application and validation of HCF life prediction tool for a representative alloy using experiment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dong Qian, Rui Zhang, Vijay Vasudevan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dong&nbsp;Qian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Application of HCF for metals</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938201905_outcome_pic2_modelvalidation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938201905_outcome_pic2_modelvalidation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Validation of HCF 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938201905_outcome_pic2_modelvalidation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Validation of HCF 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Validation of HCF life prediction tool for synthetic rubber using experiment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dong Qian</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dong&nbsp;Qian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Validation of HCF 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938466872_outcome_pic3_kevin_tang--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938466872_outcome_pic3_kevin_tang--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Education and outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1335204/1335204_10259758_1496938466872_outcome_pic3_kevin_tang--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Education and outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An example of education/outreach: High school student Kevin Tang participated in research through STEM program and gave a presentation on his research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dong Qian</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dong&nbsp;Qian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Education and outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
