 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe PIs propose to continue and expand GPS and seismic for ANET-POLENET Phase 2 to advance understanding of geodynamic processes and their influence on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. ANET-POLENET science themes include: 1) determining ice mass change since the last glacial maximum, including modern ice mass balance; 2) solid earth influence on ice sheet dynamics; and 3) tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and feedbacks with ice sheet evolution. Nine new remote continuous GPS stations, to be deployed in collaboration with U.K. and Italian partners, will augment ANET-POLENET instrumentation deployed during Phase 1. Siting is designed to better constrain uplift centers predicted by GIA models and indicated by Phase 1 results. ANET-POLENET Phase 2 builds on Phase 1 scientific, technological, and logistical achievements including 1) seismic images of crust and mantle structure that resolve the highly heterogeneous thermal and viscosity structure of the Antarctic lithosphere and underlying mantle; 2) newly identified intraplate glacial, volcanic, and tectonic seismogenic processes; 3) improved estimates of intraplate vertical and horizontal crustal motions and refinement of the Antarctic GPS reference frame; and 4) elucidation of controls on glacial isostatic adjustment-induced crustal motions due to laterally varying earth structure. The PIs present a nominal plan to reduce ANET by approximately half to a longer-term community \"backbone network\" in the final 2 years of this project. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nMonitoring and understanding mass change and dynamic behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet using in situ GPS and seismological studies will help improve understanding of how Antarctic ice sheets respond to a warming world and how will this response impacts sea-level and other global changes. Seismic and geodetic data collected by the backbone ANET-POLENET network are openly available to the scientific community. ANET-POLENET is integral in the development and realization of technological and logistical innovations for year-round operation of instrumentation at remote polar sites, helping to advance scientifically and geographically broad studies of the polar regions. The ANET-POLENET team will establish a training initiative to mentor young polar scientists in complex, multidisciplinary and internationally collaborative research. ANET-POLENET will continue the broad public outreach to the public about polar science through the polenet.org website, university lectures, and K-12 school visits. This research involves multiple international partners.",

Technological improvements in autonomous power, communications and instrument housing were achieved and have been adopted for use in instrument systems deployed by a range of science disciplines in remote and environmentally harsh settings.\n\nMovements of the bedrock underlying the ice sheets covering Antarctica are expected to be driven by changes in the weight of the overlying ice sheet, with the earth rising or ?rebounding? in regions where the ice sheet is thinning.  Thus, the patterns of vertical and horizontal bedrock motions, measured by the project GPS instruments, provide a unique proxy record of ice mass change across West Antarctica. Project science results have transformed understanding of the ?rebound? process, known as glacial isostatic adjustment, and have driven new approaches to predicting the future contributions of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level.  Measurement of extremely high rates of uplift by our instrument network in the Amundsen Embayment region of West Antarctica changed the prevailing view that glacial isostatic processes occurred at time scales that are too slow to influence the flow behavior of the overlying ice sheet.  At the uplift rates we measure, feedbacks between the deforming bedrock and the ice sheet above have the potential to slow ice sheet retreat, or even cause ice sheet readvance, based on modeling of coupled ice ?

These anomalously warm regions are expected to supply heat to the overlying ice sheet that could change its flow behavior.  When the lateral variation and weak deep Earth layers are taken into account in modeling studies, estimation of future Antarctic ice mass loss and contributions to sea level change can rise or fall, depending on assumptions and uncertainties.  Since West Antarctic ice loss has a particularly large ?sea level fingerprint? on the coastlines of North America, future research stimulated by the project results is crucial.\n\nEducation and outreach components of this project have made major contributions to training a new cohort of scientists with the advanced skills required to carry out complex, interdisciplinary research involving international collaboration.  Large ?training schools? on glacial isostatic adjustment modeling and on studying the cryosphere remotely using seismology were organized and led by this project, with support of international science organizations and by leading scientists from many nations.  During the ten years of Phases 1 &amp; 2 of this project, over 60 students and postdoctoral fellows participated in this multi-institutional project, gaining experience in research, polar field work, and multidisciplinary collaboration. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terry J Wilson"
