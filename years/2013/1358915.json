 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate whether variation in leaf chemistry between trees in different locations in a tropical forest is determined by who their parent trees were or by differences in local environmental conditions.  Individual trees of the same species in the tropical rain forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, differ in the chemical composition of their leaves as well as in their DNA.  This project aims to develop new techniques that use this variation to map the genealogy of the trees in a forest from the air.  Researchers will first directly determine which trees in each of three canopy species are descended from which others for a number of trees by collecting information on the DNA of each species.  Next, differences in DNA will be related to seven chemical properties of the leaves that can be detected from high-resolution observations by an imaging spectrometer (the Carnegie AToMS system) designed to acquire measurements of biological diversity and foliar chemistry in species-rich, tropical rain forests. Finally, aerial images of these chemical properties of individual trees of the species over a wider area will be used to detect genetic lineages of trees without having to collect samples directly.  In addition to addressing the ?nature vs. nurture? question, the project will seek to provide a new tool for using remote sensing to identify the genetic lineages of the trees in a forest, a large-scale level of genetic detail rarely achieved to date.\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to the development of infrastructure for research and education by improving capacity for understanding biological diversity throughout large landscapes using advanced airborne remote sensing. Exposure to these technologies will help to prepare future generations of scholars for careers in science and natural resource management.",

The objectives of this project were to: (1) sample leaves from two focal species of trees that we have mapped throughout the 15.4 square kilometers of Barro Colorado Island, Panama using high-resolution satellite data; (2) sequence and assemble the genomes of these two species; (3) characterize variable positions in the genomes of individuals of the two focal species (&gt;150 individuals of each species) to infer family-level relationships (e.g., parent-offspring, full-sibs, half-sibs, second-cousin once-removed) among the individuals we sampled; and (4) relate these data to measurements of foliar chemistry collected using airborne imaging spectroscopy (the Carnegie AToMS sensor). During 2013, we collected leaves from 103&nbsp;<em>H. guayacan</em>&nbsp;and 99&nbsp;<em>J. copaia</em>, and characterized variable positions in the genomes (also called single-nucleotide positions or SNPs) of 95 individuals of each focal species. We sequenced 2,536 SNPs in&nbsp;<em>H. guayacan</em>&nbsp;and 7,719 SNPs in&nbsp;<em>J. copaia</em>. From these SNP data, we computed pairwise estimates of relatedness among individuals of each species, and we examined spatial patterns in relatedness within adult populations. We expected these data to show that spatial clusters of adult individuals for each of the two focal species are closely related, and that trees that are farther apart are more distantly related. The data suggested that most individuals we sampled were weakly related (relatedness coefficients &lt; 0.1), but that occasional pairs of trees that were spatially proximate&nbsp;were also closely related (relatedness coefficients close to 0.5). Trees that were far apart were less closely related. We also observed clusters of closely-related trees separated by large distances, and most of the variation in relatedness was not explained by distance. To validate these results, we collected leaf tissue from an additional 204&nbsp;<em>H. guayacan</em>&nbsp;and 84&nbsp;<em>J. copaia</em>&nbsp;individuals during 2015 used both genome-reduction and genome-resequencing methods to characterize SNPs in this independent sample of individuals. Analyses of these validation data are ongoing. This project supported collaboration with private industry to sequence the genomes of both species. The project has produced 4 peer-reviewed publications, 2 publications in review, and 1 publication in development, with additional work ongoing. The project has supported 9 undergraduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles, Louisiana State University, and Brown University, one research technician at Brown University, two graduate students at the University of Georgia and Brown University, and a post-doctoral research scientist at the University of Georgia.
