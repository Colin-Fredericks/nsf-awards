The recent advances in this field have not only broadened our horizon regarding the optical properties of carbon nanostructures and their potential towards new applications, they have also stimulated intense discussions regarding issues of fundamental interest as well as more technical issues. NSF funds will be used to provide partial support for graduate students and invited speakers to attend the 5th International Workshop on Nanotube Optics and Nanospectroscopy (WONTON 2013) in Santa Fe, NM, USA.,  June 16-20, 2013. This four-day workshop will bring together world leaders and young researchers to discuss recent advances and discoveries related to the spectroscopy of nanotubes and graphene. It will feature 26 invited talks and about 70 contributed talks and poster presentations. Its small size and focus on nanotube and graphene spectroscopy will provide an ideal forum for fruitful and stimulating interactions among young and established researchers.",
