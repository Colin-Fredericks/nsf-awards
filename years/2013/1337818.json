Although the reasoning for combining all of these techniques is straightforward, currently there is no such instrument available. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a multi-parametric/multimodal spectroscopy (MPMS) system for simultaneous application of surface-mediated optical and electrochemical techniques The proposed MPMS system, which combines three spectroscopic techniques, will facilitate new quantitative insights into the interactions of a broad range of chemical and biological species with rationally designed interfaces. Through the combination of synergistic sensing techniques, this new approach can overcome several  key limitations of current, widely-used surface characterization technologies.",
