 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Benjamin Schrager of the University of Hawaii at Manoa of to conduct a research project in Geography during the summer of 2013 at Sophia University in Tokyo.  The project title is \"Genetically Modified Food in Japan: the Intersection of Science, Policy and Consumer Perceptions.\" The host scientist is James Farrer.\r\n\r\nThis study examines science, policy and consumer perceptions related to genetically modified food in Japan. Data is being collected and analyzed from scientific reports, government documents, interviews and surveys. The working question is \"What governmental frameworks regulate genetically modified food in Japan?\" This question is answered using interviews with ministry officials, professors, consumer groups, consumers and biotech advocates. Policy documents from the United States Department of Agriculture, Japanese ministries, legislative documents and popular media are also consulted. Science and consumer perceptions are contextualized within these governmental frameworks. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, outcomes of the research project have implications for U.S.-Japan trade, as agricultural biotechnology is an important factor in trade relations and Japan is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans and corn of which most are genetically modified. The Fellow will explore appropriate venues to share the findings, including conferences, public forums and publications.",
