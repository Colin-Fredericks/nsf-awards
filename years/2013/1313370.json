 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the last stage of a NSF supported effort. The Digital Analysis of a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project is now fully ready with its hardware, software and personnel resource planning and full production scanning, processing and data distribution and archiving can begin. This final grant will bring the world's only full-century Time Domain Astrophysics (TDA) database and analysis tools on line for the full community to utilize as a key survey that complements current surveys (PTF, CRT and PS1) and provides long-term context for LSST. The high speed precision DASCH scanner (two 8 x 10in imaging plates digitized into 11&#956;m pixels in 90 sec) and initial astrometry and photometry have now i) improved astrometry that allows multiple exposure plate solutions as well as initial astrometry essentially independent of what the plate jacket might have indicated, ii) improved photometry.  We build the Pipeline and Database software and hardware to enable the original goal to scan and fully process ~400 plates/day, which would enable the full collection of ~450,000 direct imaging plates to be scanned and fully reduced, with rapid access to images (thumbnails), lightcurves , and data products on spinning disk.  The present effort will finish the production scanning, overnight processing, and full data releases (DRs, in 10 installments) of the ~375,000 plates remaining. Although a single field (6o centered on M44, our first \"development field\") is now in the public domain, the limited coverage presents the novel TDA surveys that DASCH can do for discovery and study of rare classes of variables which require larger survey coverage. \r\n\r\nDASCH incorporates students at every stage and a vigorous program of Public Outreach. This research will open the astronomical window of time variability on long timescales (months-100y) from currently existing, but inaccessible and barely-mined data. Digitization is the key and can now be done with our new ultra-high speed scanner and high speed processing and database. Accessing the past data complements present (e.g. PanSTARRS) and future temporal surveys (LSST). Opening this new temporal window has already revealed new phenomena; it will surely excite new students and the public at large.\r\nThis project will awaken the public awareness that the universe is not static. Evolution and change are the rule, not the exception. The impact on science education can be large: by showing on the project website segments of the \"cosmic movie\" of giant flares from quasars or stars, or the heart beat pulsations of Cepheid variables, students will better understand the excitement of current astronomy. Physical understanding of the dynamic universe is even more enticing than the immutable sky. The public website to be fully developed by this investigation will be fully accessible to the public and astronomical community. DASCH will have significant impact on the general drive to Temporal Surveys for a number of projects now in development. It makes available the truly unique dataset that only a century of sky coverage can provide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe principal goal of the DASCH project is to make available for robust scientific use as well as public engagement a century of astronomical imaging from the Harvard College Observatory Plate Stacks.  With over 500,000 wide-format photographs dating back into the late 19th century, these plates are an astonishing historical record of time-variable astronomical events.  This century-scale view is highly complementary to the more precise and deeper imaging of modern time-domain observations, allowing us to put the rare (and most important) bright events into context and to track the recurring patterns of individual objects whose natural time scales are beyond the reach of the decade view of modern surveys.\nAt the heart, the DASCH project involves producing high-quality digital scans of over half a million photographic plates, mapping the whole sky with over 1000-fold coverage, and writing and running software to perform photometry and astrometry on these scans.  But to do this, we must also deal with the heterogeneity of the data and attempt to capture the historical context of the plates.  For example, much of the documentation is in written logs and written annotations on the plates themselves.  This information must be photographed, transcribed where possible, and brought into the database in a useful manner.\nScanning plates is a physical job.  Each plate must be handled, inspected, photographed, cleaned, and scanned.  Doing this a half million times is labor intensive, yet requires continued attention to assure that the final data entries are correct, since the intent of the project is to produce a database that can be used for science without physical access to the original plate.\nFinally, DASCH produces a public portal for this database, so that researchers around the world can access this past century of astronomical history.  \nAt the conclusion of this grant, DASCH has scanned about 2/3 of the available material. We have produced a public data release (DR6) that presents all of the catalog photometry and astrometry, as well as the digitized source material and metadata, for all of the plates north of the galactic plane, half the sky based on 195,191 plates and with a typical coverage of 1500 separate observations per star.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan E Grindlay"
