 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the University of Montana (UM), the Advancing Research through Network Improvements (ARNI) project provides dedicated high speed desktop and building level connections for several key sites housing active research requiring large bandwidth. This project removes an identified bottleneck and allows researchers to take advantage of the Northern Tier Network (NTN), a 10Gb network path spanning Seattle to Minneapolis.  ARNI is a key component of a 10 year UM Information Technology Office (ITO) cyberinfrastructure improvement effort which developed a high-speed, high availability network path from the campus edge to the national information superhighway, and a resilient campus core network. ARNI greatly extends the ability of UM researchers to participate in their sphere of science, work in collaboration with other partners and disciplines at national and international levels, and extends the impact of these research efforts to students and to a broader research community. ITO, in collaboration with the Social Science Research Laboratory (SSRL) and researchers from the Division of Biological Sciences, Geography, and Geosciences, identified multiple scientific research projects that benefit directly from ARNI. These include projects that employ genomics methods in biological sciences, geodynamics research on earthquakes in East Africa and Central Asia, and a prototype system for predicting insect and climate-induced impacts on fire hazards in the western United States. A special aspect of this project is the direct association between IT professionals and the campus scientific research community which is providing sound IT solutions that are critical for future competitiveness in grant funding and academic contribution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCC-NIE Integration:  Advancing Research through Network Improvements (ARNI)\n\nThe University of Montana has completed the CC-NIE grant \"CC-NIE Integration:  Advancing Research through Network Improvements\".  Completion of this project has removed technological roadblocks for researchers in three key buildings on campus, allowing improved project planning, execution and sharing of data and results.  These three buildings of the UM campus house scientific research including interdisciplinary, health sciences and biological sciences.  All areas have been positively impacted by the ARNI project, notably around the facilitation of existing research projects such as those in the McCutcheon Lab within UM\u00c6s Health Sciences building. \n\nRepresentative of the project success, the Health Sciences building was upgraded with fiber optic cabling, Cat-6 copper cabling and related network equipment that resulted in two 10Gb connections to UM\u00c6s network core at the building level, 10Gb connectivity between floors of the building and 1Gb connectivity to each end user.  Reports from the McCutcheon Lab in the Health Sciences building reveal that the network changes allow researchers to now routinely move large datasets between servers and workstations within the building, as well as beyond to the NSF-supported XSEDE network.  A specific outcome included the ability for the McCutcheon Lab to analyze its most complex genome assembly dataset to date in a timely manner, reporting in published outcomes this year (Campbell et al., 2015, PNAS 112:10192-10199).  Without the increased network speeds, the data may not have been analyzed as well or as quickly, and it is unlikely that the outcomes would have been shared this year.\n\nLess extensive network upgrades were needed in both the Interdisciplinary Studies and Clapp (science complex) buildings, where existing wiring and equipment joined upgrades to extend dual 10Gb connectivity to the buildings, 10Gb connectivity between floors of the buildings and 1Gb connectivity to the users.  The project brought about collaboration between UM\u00c6s Information Technology Office and researchers in the building to understand research needs, implement new network upgrades and measure outcomes using perfSONAR and other network performance monitoring tools to understand the effects around the movement of research data in these buildings.\n\nUpon completion of fiber optic cable installation, copper wire upgrades (to Cat-6), network switch upgrades, addition of perfSONAR and other network performance monitoring tools and subsequent measurements of network performance, UM has been able to identify latency issues in the campus network, make informed choices about installation of wiring, placement of network equipment and location of research computing equipment in relation to the existing cyberinfrastructure.  Through outcomes of the ARNI project, UM\u00c6s ITO has been able confirm needs for a ScienceDMZ configuration between the campus core and edge networks, gaining the training, experience and collaboration with researchers on campus that will be necessary for success in further implementation of UM\u00c6s cyberinfrastructure plan.\n\nIn meeting scientific research utilization and research outcomes goals, UM\u00c6s ARNI project allowed researchers to submit additional proposals due to access with an improved cyberinfrastructure, as well as confidence in UM\u00c6s ITO that network performance monitoring tools, such as perfSONAR, could inform configuration changes to meet research needs.  Proposals that were submitted specifically due to the network enhancements included an Engineering Information Foundation proposal for \"Computational Infrastructure for Earthquake Preparedness in the Developing World\", and a Moore Foundation proposal for \"Data Mining for Relational Structure in the Global Earthquake Catalog\". \n\nIn general, UM\u00c6s outcome for science with the ARNI project is a paradigm shift from a culture within UM where researchers lived with the chal..."
