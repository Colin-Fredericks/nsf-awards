Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) provides a unique combination of research and educational experiences designed to promote reduction in earthquake vulnerability. With support from the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers(EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation(CMMI), NEESreu students will engage in state-of-the-art experiments using large-scale test facilities involving physical models, computational models, and data analysis to generate new knowledge that advances earthquake and tsunami risk mitigation. Facilities include shake tables, large-scale structural testing systems, geotechnical centrifuges, mobile field laboratories, permanently instrumented geotechnical field stations, and a tsunami wave. Students will collaborate on active NEES research projects, which tackle a breadth of high priority earthquake mitigation issues ranging from performance of the nation's infrastructure (bridges, ports, pipelines, and levees) to innovative strategies for reducing damage and losses to buildings to the interaction of structures and tsunamis. In addition, this NEESreu program will demonstrate advanced methods for preparing engineering students to participate in geographically-distributed research projects using collaboration tools that are becoming common place in research and professional practice. NEESreu students will use the latest IT collaboration tools to form virtual peer teams for supporting each other's research. Short-term and long-term assessment will provide data to better understand best practices for enhancing collaboration among geographically-distributed undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nThe George E.

The NEESreu program aims to influence the future of earthquake engineering with special attention to training and mentoring a diverse, professionally prepared workforce, and to attract undergraduate and underrepresented students into STEM careers. Students will gain an understanding of the global impact of earthquake engineering; gain confidence using Web 2.0 technologies; gain enthusiasm for research that translates into a desire to pursue postgraduate education; and develop a network of peers that lasts beyond the REU.",
