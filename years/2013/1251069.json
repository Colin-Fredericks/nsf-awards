 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to transform the way that scientists, engineers, and medical professionals make use of big data in order to further science, solve challenging problems in medical device engineering, and, ultimately, improve the nation's health.  The approach makes use of big data from medical imaging, supercomputer simulation, and other sources.  These exciting datasets are just now becoming available and have great potential to revolutionize science, engineering, and medicine.  Unfortunately, scientists today cannot take full advantage of these data because they lack the appropriate tools to work with such large and complex datasets.  This research addresses that problem by creating new computer graphics-based data visualization tools and coupling these with novel human-computer interfaces that specifically support data-driven engineering design.  The new style of interactive visual computing that these tools provide can be especially powerful for supporting the human process of design.  Thus, an anticipated major scientific result of the work is a new approach for supporting creative human-in-the-loop tasks when working with big data. The impact of this new approach is demonstrated through a series of applications to medical device design problems, such as designing improved breast biopsy devices and cardiac leads.\r\n\r\nThe long-term objectives of this project are to enable a paradigm-shifting future for simulation-based engineering with big data and to demonstrate this future through specific applications to challenging problems in medical device design.  The approach is to couple the intense amounts of medical imaging, physical simulation, and other life sciences data that are generated today with new computational tools that not only support automated data analysis but also powerfully leverage our own human capabilities to see, touch, explore, and analyze.  By adopting a human-centric approach to big data science, including significant new research in the areas of data visualization and human-computer interfaces, the work is expected to not only accelerate basic research and discovery but also make the results of big data science accessible to doctors, medical device engineers, and countless other creative thinkers who do not necessarily have a core background in computational methods.  There are three main thrusts to the research:  (1) Advancing medical device engineering through applications of new data-intensive design tools; (2) Developing a creative new as-direct-as-possible inverse method for simulation-based engineering; and (3) Coupling data-intensive virtual design with new tangible tools for working with big data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project team has completed a research project with the goal of advancing and optimally combining computational tools for data-intensive modeling, simulation, and visualization with the irreplaceable insights that humans bring to the most challenging science and engineering problems. The research has been applied to some of today?s most complex datasets, generated on supercomputers to help engineers design more effective and longer lasting medical devices (e.g., breast biopsy devices, implantable cardiac leads). The results fit into a bigger picture of research that aims to understand how humans can work most effectively and creatively with computers in this new age of big data.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe project has made intellectual contributions to knowledge, theory, and practice in both computer science and mechanical engineering.  These results have been well received, with publications in top venues for both data visualization and medical device engineering and one best paper award (honorable mention).\n\nThe first major solution to the problem of better integrating human insights within interactive data-driven engineering design processes is embodied in a tool called \"Design by Dragging\" and was applied to the designing improved vacuum-assisted breast biopsy devices.  The data are from hundreds of simulations of device-tissue interactions for different device parameters.  Engineers use an inverse design interface to find the \"sweet spot\" in the design space, giving the system an almost \"magical\" feel.  If the designer sees an area of high stress that looks problematic, he can simply click on a contour line within the stress field visualization and drag it to a new location.  The visualization updates in real time, morphing toward a new design \"in the direction of\" the user?s dragging motion.  This is a radically different way to approach simulation-based design, and it can provide a valuable foundation for design with big data upon which many other researchers can build.\n\nThe second major solution is embodied in a virtual reality (VR) based visualization environment called Bento Box.  It helped engineers understand an ensemble of 10 volumetric simulations of cardiac leads with different stiffness and length parameters within the right atrium of the heart.  These simulations sample the design space to test how different cardiac designs impact stresses and blood flow in the atrium.  The VR visualization environment arranges the data ensemble in a grid.  Each data instance is assigned a column and different views of the data are presented in rows. Using this, engineers can see, understand, and react in their revised designs to even subtle changes in flow and stress at different 3D locations within the heart.\n\nEnable these two major results, the project also advanced research in computational simulation models.  New models were developed for biopsy needle and tissue cutting interactions and parameterized fluid-structure interaction for cardiac leads in the right atrium.  Using the models and visualization tools together, the research was evaluated via the driving medical device engineering design problems and in collaboration with expert users.  The project also contributed new algorithms and user interface techniques for printing 3D data visualizations, including of the anatomy, and integrating these physical big data artifacts together with virtual data visualizations.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe work has already impacted the medical engineering domain, where collaborators are using the new algorithms, techniques, and models, and follow-on studies are being planned.  The results generalize to work with many other datasets and exploratory visualization tasks; thus, broad impact is anticipated as others build upon the research and apply the results to new areas of science and engineering.  Five computer science students (5 PhD, 1 undergrad), two mechanical engineering students (1 a woman), and three scientific computing students have been supported in part by the project and trained in science and engineering methods.  Two Ph.D. dissertations have resulted directly from the core project research, and two more are expected in the coming years. Each year of the project, the research team hosted about 50 K-12 students for special research presentations and hands-on demonstrations in collaboration with programs, such as TRIO Upward Bound, Eureka!, and Discover STEM, that are designed to reach groups underserved and/or underrepresented in science.  Results have also been integrated with teaching at the University of Minnesota.  Open source software, videos, publications, and other results are archived on the project website.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel F Keefe"
