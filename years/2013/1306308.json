 "awd_abstract_narration": "An atom interferometer will be used as an ultra-sensitive tool for measuring perturbations to atomic motion.  Laser beams usually attract or repel atoms, but this project will identify wavelengths of light that leave atoms unperturbed.  Measuring these so-called \"tune-out wavelengths\" with unprecedented sub-picometer accuracy will serve as a benchmark test for sophisticated atomic structure calculations.  This work will establish measurements of tune-out wavelengths as a novel way to test calculations that are needed to support atomic clocks, quantum computation, and atomic parity violation studies.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include training students to pioneer new applications for atom optics.  Atom optics refers to the art of manipulating atomic de Broglie waves, much like ordinary light waves, by reflection, refraction, and diffraction.  This project also teaches students to use nanotechnology, such as nanostructure diffraction gratings that serve as beam splitters for atoms.",
