 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing modules that introduce quantitative activities based on large, long-term and sensor-based systems for undergraduates at a diverse suite of institutions.\r\n  \r\nIntellectual merit:  This project is developing the skills required to manipulate large datasets at different scales while improving the students' reasoning skills by engaging them in authentic research experiences.  The project's methods are designed to sharpen the highly transferable skills (i.e., data integration, statistical proficiency and analysis) necessary for doing science in the digital age.  Online datasets supported by National Atmospheric Deposition Program, Global Lake Ecological Observatory network (GLEON) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, among others, will be used to develop a framework for modules that yield important ecological information for the biological community while providing engaging experiences with authentic data for the undergraduate students at a variety of academic institutions.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  From an educational perspective, this project provides an opportunity for undergraduates from a diverse group of schools to partake in analyses on authentic data provided from national centers on real and pressing environmental issues. Assessment of the project focuses on the effects of the modules on competency in inquiry, quantitative reasoning, and students' ability to conduct scientific discourse.  The project also represents a collaboration of scientists in a range of environmental disciplines and career stages brought together by a common desire to improve undergraduate student experience and learning. \r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",
