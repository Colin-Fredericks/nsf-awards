 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fossil insects provide a unique deep-time record of ecological and evolutionary response to past environmental changes and therefore are invaluable for understanding the impacts of climate change on the current biodiversity crisis.  Given current models of future climate change and the important role that insects play in human society (biodiversity, pests, pollination, vectors of disease) the ability to access these data and make predictions about future insect populations becomes even more urgent. The Fossil Insect Collaborative will make available all the major collections of fossil insect specimens in the United States by creating electronic specimen records consisting of digital images and associated collection data. \r\n\r\nThe digitized fossil insect collections will be made broadly accessible to the research community, K-16 education, government and industry, the general public, and the media through the project website and a central site integrating all the paleobiological Thematic Collections Networks called iDigPaleo.  Mobile apps and activities that allow a wide variety of users to experience and interact directly with the collections data will be developed. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

This collection represents one of the largest holdings of fossil terrestrial arthropods in the United States, with 68,817 individual specimen records digitized and an associated 61,161 digital images. The digitization of this collection, which consists primarily of Colorado material from the Green River Formation and Florissant Fossil Beds, has made it much more broadly available for research and education and has already resulted in the publication of several new species. The collection and associated digitized material also served as the foundation for several graduate student theses at CU Boulder during the course of the award.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The FIC TCN project also enabled the development of the iDigPaleo portal (https://idigpaleo.org), which serves digital specimen data and images from several paleontology themed digitization projects including this one. The portal significantly lowers the bar for exploring specimen data and images through clickable filters and by automatically displaying records with images when a user clicks on the Browse Collections tab. It also hosts a suite of annotation and other tools that can be used in the classroom alongside lesson plans that focus on STEM learning goals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the project has made possible numerous opportunities for dissemination of information and professional development for permanent staff on the project as well as numerous undergraduate and graduate students at CU Boulder. A Facebook page (active) and Twitter account (inactive) were setup at the start of the project to share newly digitized specimens, publications, and other TCN events and progress. The Facebook page, which has nearly 1500 followers, will remain active after the completion of the project and serve as a place to share information about our collections with the public. Members of the FIC TCN have been active leaders and participants in the iDigBio Paleo Digitization Working Group over the course of the award, hosting webinars and in person meetings as well as sharing knowledge they gained from working on the project. Several FIC TCN student digitization assistants from CU Boulder have gone on to permanent careers working in museum collections, managing their own digitization projects and coming full circle as active professionals in the community.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/08/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Talia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Karim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602199106087_8575_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602199106087_8575_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UCM 8575\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602199106087_8575_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UCM 8575\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Parabates memorialis (holotype) from the Florissant Fossil Beds.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CUMNH Invertebrate Paleontology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Talia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Karim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UCM 8575</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198127795_66405_UCM_habitus_1-4xtele_65mm_1x--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198127795_66405_UCM_habitus_1-4xtele_65mm_1x--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UCM 66405\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198127795_66405_UCM_habitus_1-4xtele_65mm_1x--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UCM 66405\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fossil cockroaches from the Eocene Green River Formation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CUMNH Invertebrate Paleontology</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Talia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Karim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UCM 66405</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198775528_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_3c1f--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198775528_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_3c1f--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FIC TCN Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198775528_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_3c1f--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FIC TCN Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FIC TCN group photo, AMNH, 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CUMNH Invertebrate Paleontology</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Talia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Karim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FIC TCN Group Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198053041_62041a_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198053041_62041a_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UCM 62041a\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1305066/1305066_10242171_1602198053041_62041a_UCM_100mm_1-15x--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UCM 62041a\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fossil dragonfly wing from the Eocene Green River Formation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CUMNH Invertebrate Paleontology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Talia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Karim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UCM 62041a</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
