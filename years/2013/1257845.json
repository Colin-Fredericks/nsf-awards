Organized under the  \r\nauspices of the Bernoulli Society and the Institute of Mathematical  \r\nStatistics, SPA has emerged as the premier international forum for the  \r\ndissemination of new results in probability and random processes.\r\n\r\nAs with past SPAs, the Boulder meeting will feature a wide range of  \r\ntopics, bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers.   \r\nIn addition to plenary talks which include the most prestigious named  \r\nlectures of the probability calendar, the Boulder meeting will be  \r\norganized around a large number of shorter contributed talks. This  \r\nprovides a platform for young probabilists and affiliated researchers  \r\nto present their work alongside the key figures of the field.  To  \r\nfacilitate these important exchanges, travel support for Ph.D.  \r\nstudents, postdocs, and new faculty, particularly for women and  \r\nunderrepresented minorities, represents a large portion of the project.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific program the Boulder meeting will feature  \r\na series of round table discussions aimed at supporting new  \r\nresearchers to the field.  Full program details are available at the  \r\nconference website: math.colorado.edu/spa2013/.",
