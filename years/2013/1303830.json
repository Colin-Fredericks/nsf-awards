 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to provide support for 4th International Workshop on Bismuth-Containing Semiconductors: Growth, Properties and Devices.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is that III-V semiconductor alloys containing Bismuth are a relatively unexplored family of materials and have attracted substantial interests due to their potential device applications. In order to promote the collaboration and communication in the field of research for Bismuth-Containing Semiconductors, bridge the researchers with industry collaborators and funding agencies, and strategically steer the overall research direction, the PI will organize 4th International Workshop on Bismuth-Containing Semiconductors: Growth, Properties and Devices, to be hosted by University of Arkansas (UA).  This meeting will bring together groups undertaking research in the emerging area of Bismuth-containing materials and devices for a three-day workshop.  The workshop will include research presentations, panel discussions, social events, and a lab tour to UA material and device research facilities.    \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are: i) Bringing together experimentalists and theoreticians who study Bi-containing materials for optoelectronics; ii) Obtaining the latest updates in this field through presentations; iii) Conducting discussions regarding how this research field can be promoted for future growth. The Workshop will organize a series of social events break so that there is substantial amount of time for the participants to get familiar each other, to exchange research ideas, and develop friendship for future collaboration.  A website for the Workshop will be developed to document the program, presentations, panel discussions, and participant list.  A plan has been made to promote the diversity of participants.",
