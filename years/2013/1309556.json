 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Pennsylvania is for the development of vesicles endowed with specific motifs to bind with cell receptors, the development of vesicles that disassemble at specific pH's, and for the incorporation of protease cleavable domains to allow programmable release. Vesicles, spherical compartments of aqueous solution surrounded by a bilayer membrane, can be used for drug delivery, imaging, and biocatalysis. With this project, vesicles will be prepared from amphiphilic protein based oleosin using the tools of recombinant biotechnology. Synthesis by recombinant methods would produce monomolecular materials with designer functionality through the incorporation of precise amino acid sequences. Oleosin, and numerous mutants resulting from either truncation or substitution of amino acids, can be expressed in E. coli with high yields. Several variants make vesicles, depending on the precise architecture of the molecules and solvent conditions. With this award, the investigator will prepare responsive vesicles by further alterations of oleosin. Students doing research in this project will be trained in multidisciplinary areas. This work will be conducted by graduate students and by high school students in a unique outreach program designed to encourage both underrepresented groups and students from high achieving schools to experience laboratory research.\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing need to make biocompatible materials that can carry bioactive agents. A vesicle, a bag of aqueous solution surrounded by a membrane, is a particularly useful material which can be loaded with drugs and imaging agents. Although vesicles are often made from lipids, research is ongoing to expand the palette of materials that can make vesicles with designer functionality. This project is to prepare biocompatible vesicles from a naturally occurring plant protein, oleosin, which the investigator has demonstrated using the biotechnology methods. With this approach, every molecule would be identical, and embedding specific functionality could be straight forward through simply changing the gene. With this project, variants of oleosin and construct vesicles will be prepared that will fall apart in response to changes in pH, which are useful for drug delivery inside of a cell, or in response to proteases, to make tumors-specific drug delivery vehicles. This work will be conducted by graduate students and by high school students, in an outreach program designed to both encourage underrepresented groups to participate in science and to get high achieving students more interested in careers in science and technology.",

These carriers can be made with precision, tailored to target specific receptors, and engineered to respond to specific environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>These materials have been made from oleosin, a plant surfactant protein that stabilizes interfaces, specifically oil bodies, in their natural biological role. Though the exact structure is unknown, they are known to have an N-terminal hydrophilic block, a core hydrophobic block, then C-terminal hydrophilic block. The wild-type oleosin has 57 residues in the N-terminus, 87 residues in the hydrophobic core, and 47 residues in the C-terminus. The structure of native oleosin is thought to resemble a hairpin with the hydrophobic core collapsed by a proline knot, and the hydrophilic arms branching off in parallel. Just prior to the start of this grant, various oleosin mutants have been shown by our laboratory to self-assemble into a variety of suprastructures including vesicles (Vargo K., Parthasarathy RA., Hammer, DA (2012). Self-assembly of tunable protein suprastructures from recombinant oleosin.&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. 109(29): 11657-11662).</p>\n<p>Notably, these structures were prepared by solubilizing the purified oleosin variants in an organic solution, consisting of sodium carbonate, chloroform and methanol, and then injection into PBS and allowing the organic phase to evaporate. This type of self assembly is often necessary when the surfactant shows significant secondary structure. Indeed, vesicles made from oleosins with 67 residues in the hydrophobic block were solid-like.</p>\n<p>Therefore one major activity in the period of the grant was to make a class of oleosins that did not have secondary structure. We did this by trimming the hydrophobic block to 30 residues, thus eliminating 5 of the six threonine resuides that provide stability and secondary structure; we call this class of molecules the \"-30- family.\" Then, we further reduced the secondary structure by replacing 5 big bulky hydrophobic residues with glycines, and called that family \"-30G-.\"</p>\n<p>Starting with these families, we then determined the types of structures these molecules make on their own, engineered these molecules with functional groups that allowed for targeting to receptors, used these functionalized versions of surfactants to stabilize and target imaging agents, and added responsiveness to enzymes to the oleosin backbone, to trigger their interaction with cell surfaces.</p>\n<p>The general strategy was to introduce protease cleavable domains into the backbone of the molecule, just above the location where the active adhesion moiety would be (see image). In such a case, the assembled nanomaterials would only be active in the presence of a protease. Oleosin was genetically modified to incorporate the integrin-binding motif RGDS just behind a domain cleavable by thrombin. The resulting modified oleosin self-assembled into spherical micelles in aqueous environments, with the RGDS motif protected by the thrombin-cleavable domain. Upon the addition of thrombin, the RGDS is exposed and the binding of the spherical micelles to breast cancer cells was shown to be increased fourfold, to an extent that was seen if RGD was exposed all of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have explored two other modifications of oleosins. In one, we have replaced arms of the oleosin with other arms, derived from other proteins. We have used either intrinsically disordered proteins, such as XTEN, and elastin. These hybrid molecules lead to the assembly of new types of structures, including vesicles and worm-like micelles, which are useful for tissuen engineering. The value of elastin in particular is that it is a widely studied protein, and its possessing a lower critical solution temperature that allows us to separating proteins as a function of temperature.</p>\n<p>In another, we have used the fact that oleosin has no cysteines to introduce cysteines into the oleosin backbone. These cysteines could be used to link drug molecules to the carriers, or to link oleosin molecules together. We have introduced cysteines to the hydrophilic arms in two locations, and into the hydrophobic core, in two different locations. In the accompanying image, we show that insertion of cysteines in the hydrophobic core, and then oxidation of the structure to form disulfide bonds, leads to the formation of larger structures, measured by dynamic light scattering, that suggest vesicles and which could be reversed by reducing agents that are naturally found in the interior of the cell. We are studying how the cysteines alter the phase behavior of the molecules, and their ability to make macromolecular assemblies.</p>\n<p>In summary, the ability to make nanocarriers from oleosin recombinantly affords us the flexibility to make assemblies that precisely included targeting agents and responsive groups, allow for the reversible assembly and dissassembly of the structures for controlled release.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hammer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309556/1309556_10256423_1475538586876_Outcomes2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309556/1309556_10256423_1475538586876_Outcomes2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cysteine labelled oleosin\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309556/1309556_10256423_1475538586876_Outcomes2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cysteine labelled oleosin\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We can introduce cysteines into oleosins for functionalization or to link oleosins together.
