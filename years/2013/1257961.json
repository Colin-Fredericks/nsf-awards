 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exoskeleton of insects functions as both skin and supporting skeleton. It is formed from a material called cuticle, composed of proteins and a carbohydrate (chitin), and simple organic compounds known as catechols. Despite this limited compositional palette, cuticle has remarkably diverse properties, ranging from soft and flexible to hard and rigid. It is quite strong, but it is lightweight compared with bone of vertebrate animals, because cuticle lacks mineral components. The mechanical properties of insect exoskeleton have certainly contributed to the overwhelming success of insects in adapting to nearly every habitat and in their development of the ability to fly. This proposal describes experiments to investigate the biochemical compounds and chemical reactions that form insect cuticle and to understand how these result in cuticular regions with differing mechanical properties. This interdisciplinary project, involving biochemists and engineers, makes use of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model organism to investigate the relationships of cuticle protein properties and chemistry with the development of rigid cuticle. The proposed approaches combine molecular and mechanical analysis to yield advances in fundamental understanding of cuticle biochemistry and development of potentially useful new materials based on cuticle chemistry. Broader impacts resulting from the research will include education and training for undergraduate and graduate students. Specific efforts at broadening opportunities for participation in science will include research experiences by diverse undergraduate students and outreach to middle school and high school students. Advances in understanding of this critical physiological system in insects will lead to a deeper knowledge of insect biology will aid in producing new types of cross-linked biopolymers based on the chemistry of cuticle. This new class of 'bioinspired' materials has potential technological applications in medicine, pharmacy and agriculture.",

Cuticle lacks any minerals, such as occur in bone. In cuticle, chitin fibers are embedded in a matrix of protein molecules, which are chemically cross-linked to increase hardness. The light-weight, organically hardened exoskeleton of insects serves as both a skin and skeleton, while being sufficiently lightweight to permit flight. Our research was aimed at understanding how insects utilize proteins and chitin to assemble exoskeletons and to use understanding of the insect cuticle structure and mechanics to design biomimetic materials with the desirable mechanical properties of cuticle, for use in biomedical or other technological devices. Despite the limited compositional palette, chitin and proteins, cuticle can have remarkably diverse properties, ranging from soft and flexible to hard and rigid. The factors that lead to synthesis and assembly of cuticular regions with differing mechanical properties are not well understood. In this interdisciplinary project we analyzed cuticular protein structure and function, cuticle mechanical properties, and investigated synthetic materials made of cuticular proteins, using a variety of experimental approaches (genetics, genomics, protein chemistry, molecular biology, and materials science).

We developed the use a material-testing method called dynamic mechanical analysis to test the properties of beetle cuticle samples, to examine the effects of experimental manipulation of cuticular proteins on cuticle rigidity and flexibility.

Experiments using electron microscopy showed that CPR27 is normally present in the layers of protein-chitin material that form the rigid cuticle.

We studied the three dimensional structure of CPR27 and found that it is mainly disordered, lacking a well-defined structure that is typical for most proteins. However, the CPR27 protein can fold into an ordered structure under conditions of dehydration, which may mimic its function in cuticle, as it dries after the insect molts and the new exoskeleton matures. We also found that CPR27 can bind to chitin, but with a somewhat low affinity. However, because the concentration of chitin is extremely high in cuticle, this binding is likely to be biologically relevant in forming protein-chitin interactions that lead to cuticle structure.</p>\n<p>We investigated a very different cuticular protein called CP30, which has an unusual amino acid sequence with low sequence complexity and a many positively and negatively charged amino acids.
