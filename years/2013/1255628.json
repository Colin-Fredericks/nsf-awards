 "awd_abstract_narration": "The known biological world is organized by two powerful timing mechanisms.  One, the circadian clock, organizes the most basic metabolic events that allow plants and animals to survive on a daily basis.  The other mechanism, the photoperiodic timer, organizes seasonal events including reproduction, migration and hibernation.  Discordance in either of these two timing mechanisms is lethal.  Yet, the connections between and the integration of the circadian clock and the photoperiodic timer are poorly understood in insects, the most abundant, diverse and, in some cases, most dangerous animals on Earth.  This research will reveal the evolutionary genetic connection between these two biological timing mechanisms using the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, which is uniquely suited to this study.  Wyeomyia smithii lives in a strong seasonal gradient that includes both a mild sea-level climate and a harsh mountain climate, all in populations located in North Carolina.  Hence, W. smithii shows great variation in its seasonal timing while at the same time expresses typical circadian behavior at all elevations.  Using five well-established circadian clock genes, we will determine which, if any, of these genes control the seasonal timer in W. smithii.  These experiments will represent the first test of the rhythmic expression of the circadian clock genes, and of the genetically based photoperiodic mechanism in a rigorous, real-world experiment.\r\n\t\r\nThe research on the evolutionary genetics and physiology of the photoperiodic timer by these researchers was the first demonstration that recent rapid climate change is driving genetic change in animals.  As the climate continues to warm, increasing numbers of tropical diseases, including dengue fever, West Nile virus and malaria, carried by insects in the tropics and subtropics, are invading and will continue to invade the United States and other temperate regions of the world.  Identifying the genes underlying the connections between the major biological timing mechanisms will provide a powerful tool for targeting, mitigating and interrupting these invasions.  This lab will continue to participate in a wide variety of media productions, workshops, and outreach to the lay community.  W. E. Bradshaw and C. M. Holzapfel are collaborating with the US Department of Agriculture to determine genetic relationships of mosquito vectors of human and livestock diseases using our next-generation genomic approaches.  Funding of this research will enable these investigators to continue their long tradition of undergraduate research training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n(1) Climate change, whether gradual over thousands of years or rapid over decades of time involves extending or contracting the growing season at temperate and polar latitudes. The ability to survive and reproduce at these latitudes is crucially dependent on being in the right physiological condition at the right place and the right time during the year.  Seasonal coordination of growth, development, reproduction, hibernation and migration are regulated by the changing day lengths during the year.  At the same time, the daily coordination of cellular biochemistry, physiological well-being, and behavior is crucial to maximizing survivorship and reproduction in a 24-hour world that does not change with the seasons.  The major question then concerns the interaction of these two biological timing mechanisms that regulate seasonal and daily well-being.  Specifically, since both timing mechanisms rely on the input of light, how can the daily clock maintain its function while the seasonal timer is both genetically and evolutionarily flexible over geographic, seasonal gradients?   Our research had previously shown that at the physiological level, these two timing mechanisms have evolved independently over the climatic gradient of North America.  The present grant enabled us to show that the evolution of the seasonal timer has done so independently of the daily clock at the molecular level.  Hence, organisms can respond to changing seasonal climates during dispersal to new localities or during rapid climate change without disrupting daily organization of their physiological well being and activities.\n\n(2) Mosquitoes are carriers of the most heinous diseases of humans and livestock.  In order to transmit disease, mosquitoes must take a blood meal, during which the pathogens in their saliva are transmitted to the host.  If there is no bite, there is no disease transmission, period.  Our research has shown that blood feeding carries a metabolic cost to biting mosquitoes and that the evolutionary transition from a biting to an obligate non-biting lifestyle actually increase lifetime reproductive success.  What this result means is that blood-feeding is not intrinsically necessary for reproductive success in contemporary mosquito populations. Using the unique opportunity of having blood feeding and obligate non-biting populations within the same fully inter-fertile species, we have been able to identify groups of genes associated with this evolutionary transition.  This work provides the future opportunity to determine whether there are genes associated with the inhibition of biting that are universal to all mosquitoes and, hence provide a novel avenue for the control of mosquito-borne diseases world-wide.  Can it be done?  We have shown that Mother Nature has done it within a single contemporary species of mosquito -- all we have to do is find out how.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William E Bradshaw"
