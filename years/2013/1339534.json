 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a short-term (less than one-year) effort to conduct initial operations and data analysis for the original FIREBIRD mission and to construct a second set of FIREBIRD cubesats to be launched in August 2014. \r\n\r\nThe Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity, Range, and Dynamics (FIREBIRD) is a space weather NSF CubeSat project that was selected for funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.   It is CubeSat mission consisting of two identical 1.5U satellites that will measure relativistic electron precipitation with unprecedented temporal resolution in a high inclination low-Earth orbit to resolve the spatial scale size and energy dependence of electron microbursts from the Van Allen radiation belts. FIREBIRD is a collaborative effort between the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and Montana State University (MSU) and is scheduled for launch in October 2013 as a secondary payload under NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program.  Support for initial mission operations and science analysis to secure the immediate and full success for FIREBIRD as well as the opportunity to develop an identical pair of spacecraft (FIREBIRD II) at a fraction of the cost of the original FIREBIRD award while the present workforce and expertise is in place are the subject of this RAPID proposal. \r\n\r\nThe so-called \"killer\" electrons in the radiation belt can produce deep dielectric discharging in spacecraft components, a significant concern for satellite health and operations. Microbursts are thought to be a significant loss mechanism for relativistic electrons but remain poorly understood, thus rendering space weather predictive models of Earth's radiation belts incomplete.  The FIREBIRD project is design to address important questions about the physical process that generates relativistic microbursts.    FIREBIRD II providing an additional pair of satellites that collect microburst observations at the same time greatly enhances the capability to assess the global impact of microbursts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to addressing fundamental space physics research and space weather applications, the FIREBIRD and FIREBIRD II projects also contribute to the training and education of a diverse population of university students. Students at MSU and UNH will have major responsibility for the design and implementation of the instruments and the spacecraft while at the same time being mentored by professionals in each expert area. The impact is that the fruits of this investigation will continue strongly for years, if not decades, as the twenty or more students who \"cut their teeth\" on this science mission become practicing scientists and engineers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe FIREBIRD-II mission is an NSF CubeSat project.  As a result of this funding, the FIREBIRD team developed, built, tested, launched, and conducted science operations with twin, 3U CubeSats since their launch in late January 2015.  Though the mission was only designed to last 3 months, the FIREBIRD-II mission continues to operate well now into its 18th month, well exceeding its expected lifetime and also exceeding the high expectations we had for scientific returns.  FIREBIRD-II is a great success.\n\nFIREBIRD-II has provided a new set of meaurements designed to elucidate  the temporal and spatial characteristics of a phenomenon known as electron microbursts, and  at lower energy ranges than habe been typically studied  in the past.  FIREBIRD is an acronym that stands for \"Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity Range and Dynamics\". Microbursts are impulsive injections of very high energy (i.e., \"relativistic\") electrons into our atmosphere at mid-latitudes from the Van Allen radiation belts.  Before FIREBIRD-II we knew many of the properties of microbursts, but only from single spacecraft that flew through them.  With only a single spacecraft, one cannot fully understand how these events are evolving in time or even how big they really are.  The new  FIREBIRD-II observations are allowing us to answer not only these fundamental questions about the  physics of the microburst phenomenon, but also about the role that  microbursts play in radiation belt dynamics.\n\nFIREBIRD-II is providing a  unique key to the mysteries of microbursts and the radiation belt that other projects and missions will and cannot.    FIREBIRD-II has provided new information, with a combined high resolution in both time and energy of the electrons, as well as coordinated two-point measurements, to allow us to probe them like never before.  The energy  spectrum of precipitating particles from FIREBIRD-II in conjunction with  spacecraft near the equator have provided a first quantitative  obervational constraint testing theories of how electron microbursts are formed, an overall  science goal that encompasses many subsidiary questions. The FIREBIRD-II has delivered on the science as proposed and as  designed.

It has also provided a new quantitative measure of electrons impacting Earth's atmosphere, which can now be used by atmospheric modelers to understand the overall impact of these electrons on middle atmosphere chemistry.\n\nThough the FIREBIRD-II mission and team are small compared to the typical space mission, the scientific and societal impacts are large.  The project resulted in signficant publications and presentations made at a variety of meetings and workshops both nationally and internationally.  The FIREBIRD-II data alone have yielded important scientific outcomes, and we are only now realizing that even greater outcomes are possible when combining these observations with other complementary space- and ground-based measurements.  Even though the FIREBIRD-II mission funding has ended, the outcomes of this project will long outlive the initial funding, providing opportunities for continued scientific discovery into the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harlan Spence"
