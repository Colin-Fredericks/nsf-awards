 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nOne of the more interesting questions in biology is how seemingly simple cells assemble and position complex structures for feeding, movement, and reproduction. The PI has identified genetic mutations that affect the patterning of cortical organelles, through targeting membrane-remodeling events.  Further analyses reveal a novel process by which cells extrude membrane-bound \"micro-vesicles\" (small packets of protein and RNA molecules) into the outside world. Micro-vesicles have recently gained widespread attention in that they represent a new class of signaling mechanism to communicate developmental and physiological responses, and represent a potential means of regulating cell-surface, pattern-generating molecules.  The work in this project will utilize high-resolution microscopic imaging of micro-vesicle formation in both normal and mutant Tetrahymena cells to develop mechanistic detail on how these structures form, function, and contribute to the patterning of cortical organelles. Micro-vesicles will further be purified for chemical analyses, to understand vesicle composition.  \r\n\r\nBroader impact:  \r\nSt. Olaf College is an undergraduate institution, devoted to the teaching of science by sharing in the process of discovery. NSF funds will support the research activities of 4 undergraduates, particularly during the summer of 2014. In Biology, students will be trained in state-of-the-art fluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as gain experience with transmission electron microscopy. In Chemistry, students will be trained in organelle isolation, SDS-PAGE analysis, and will utilize the department's mass spectrometer for proteomic analyses.  An emphasis is placed on first-hand undergraduate use of state-of-the-art instrumentation, to prepare students for productive scientific careers. Along this line, undergraduates will further be challenged to present their results at meetings and in publications. Together, the scientific and broader impacts of this project will develop a novel pathway that cells use to communicate and respond to environmental information, and foster the training of the next generation of scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project allows us to explore novel forms of cell communication using a single celled freshwater organism callled Tetrahymena, a ciliated protozoan.  During our work we have shown that, just like when a sperm and egg cell first make contact, two mating Tetrahymena cells issue a chemical signal, namely a pulse of calclium within the cell.  We further show that this signal enters the nucleus where it triggers expression of genes that prepare the cells for cell adhesion and cell-fusion that accompanies mating.  Once mating cells attach, we find that they release membrane bound packages into the narrow gap at the point of cell-cell contact.  We find these membrane packages are full of RNA.  In other model organisms, such RNA-rich extracellular packages have proven to carry signals from one cell to another.  We are deeply involved in discovering whether or not our ciliates are exchanging RNA-signals during mating, and  whether such signals affect the decision to complete development or terminate it.  Finally, we are using our new tools (NSF purchased) to identify proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell fusion during mating.  Our first discovery was a protein called Hap2 that allows sperm cells to fuse with egg cells in plants, animals and now protists!  It is intriguing that this male-specific \"fusion protein\" is expressed in all seven ciliate sexes, a discovery with implications for the evolution of sexual fusion in all living things.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric S Cole"
