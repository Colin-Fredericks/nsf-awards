 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how prosody is used in spoken language to signal how words are grouped into phrases and how each word and phrase contributes information to the discourse. In text these functions are signaled through punctuation and text enhancement (eg., boldface), but in spoken language pitch, timing, loudness, voice quality, and other properties of speech convey such information. Linguists propose that underlying the prosody of all languages is a universal structure, the Headed Constituent (HC), which groups syllables and words together, with one prominent element per constituent designated the Head element. These constituents determine how speech sounds are coordinated (at a physical level), and how speech is mapped onto syntactic and semantic structures that determine utterance meaning. \r\n\r\nProsodic constituents are examined in English, Spanish, and French, three languages that are known to differ not only in their prosody (eg., intonation and rhythmic patterns), but also in the associations linking prosody to syntax and semantics. Experiments conducted in Illinois, Barcelona and Lyon will show how how listeners perceive the prosodic phrasing and prominence patterns of an utterance when presented with speech samples that differ in their phonetic properties (pitch and timing), and in syntactic and semantic features. A novel method of real-time, auditory transcription with non-expert listeners and conversational speech samples is intended to best approximate conditions of normal language use. Parallel experiments on English, Spanish, and French will provide critical evidence regarding the universality of the Headed Constituent as the structure that underlies prosodic form, and will also shed light on differences among languages in the role of prosody in communicating linguistic meaning. \r\n\r\nProject findings will contribute valuable benchmark data on how prosody functions in conversational speech, with future applications in clinical settings to identify speech disorders involving prosody, in second language teaching, and in development of speech technologies for human-computer interfaces.",

The goal of this project was to understand how listeners perceive prosody, in terms of identifying words that stand out as prominent in an utterance, and the grouping words into phrases. Both of these functions (prominence, phrasing) are essential for comprehending sentences and larger discourse segments, especially as speech is naturally produced, in a continuous flow of words.&nbsp; In a series of experiments with native speakers of English, French and Spanish, we find differences among languages, and among individuals, in the way listeners attend to pitch, timing and loudness in spoken utterances, and how they make use of those acoustic dimensions as cues for identifying prominent words and phrasal word groupings. In addition, we find differences in the perception of&nbsp; prosody that reflect listeners&rsquo; expectations about word prominence and phrasing based on the prosodic patterns that are most typical in their native language. In other words, we find evidence that the prosodic form of an utterance is on one hand perceived based on cues present in the speech signal, but is also in some contexts an auditory hallucination, as patterns are perceived for which little or no cues exist in the in the speech signal.

This experimental platform enabled us to collect perceptual ratings of prosody from over one hundred participants, using speech samples from existing databases of recorded conversational speech. The RPT method and the LMEDS web platform not only supplied data for our cross-linguistic research on prosody, but also offer valuable tools for future efforts to build prosodically annotated speech databases for the development of computer speech technologies, in any spoken language.
