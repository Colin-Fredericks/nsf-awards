 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a United States delegation of about 20 experts to attend a workshop in Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK), to discuss advanced manufacturing with a similar number of researchers from the ROK. The workshop will be held in March, 2013, and the ROK delegation will be hosted by the Korean National Research Foundation.  The goal of the workshop is to identify research topics of mutual interest to academic researchers supported by National Science Foundation domestically, and by the Korean National Research Foundation in Korea.  The workshop discussions will focus in four topical areas: industrial robotics, manufacturing mathematics, materials processing and sub-micron and nano-manufacturing.  The workshop will be preceeded by two days of tours of important Korean manufacturing research facilities to give the United Stated delegation a better understanding of the areas of expertise and research facilities available in Korea.  The workshop itself will also be two days in duration.  The result of the workshop will be a report detailing areas for beneficial collaboration between Korea and the United States with the expectation that it will be followed up with proposals for research in these areas.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will promote international collaboration in academic research, particularly in the four topic areas of the workshop.  By so doing, it will accelerate research in these areas.  Further, it will help students gain an international perspective and broaden their educational experience.",
