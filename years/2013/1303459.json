The funding granted by the NSF ($10,000 total) was used to provide financial support to early-career researchers (graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers) to participate to the 7th &laquo; Huntsville GRB Symposium &raquo;. This support was provided as a partial reimbursement of travel costs, for an amount not to exceed $1200 for each awardee, based on receipts sent by the awardees after the end of the conference. Nine attendees were chosen to receive this financial support : 6 graduate students and 3 postdocs &ndash; among them one woman &ndash; from institutions of 6 countries (including the United States). All were required to attend the conference and contribute either a poster of an oral presentation.\n \nA press conference was held, on the topic of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, a special class of sources which were the focus of a special session durting the conference. Articles can be found for example at the following addresses :\nhttp://www.universetoday.com/101486/new-kind-of-gamma-ray-burst-is-ultra-long-lasting/\nhttp://www.ineffableisland.com/2013/04/dying-supergiant-stars-implicated-in.html\nhttp://www.irap.omp.eu/en/actualites/actu_gamma\n\n\nWe took the oppportunity of this gathering of specialists to ask a senior scientist to present our field to non-scientists in a free public lecture, organized in collaboration with the Barnard-Seyfert Astronomical Society of Nashville. The lecture was very well received by the amateur astronomers. A workshop for middle- and high-school teachers was also organized in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Dyer observatory, on the topic of black holes and gamma-ray bursts. After the workshop the participants were invited to visit the Observatory's facilities. \n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Veronique Pelassa"
