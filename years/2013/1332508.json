The PIs propose to strengthen the students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills by integrating computational thinking into lower-level courses. This strategy will be coupled with a pre-college summer program that will be designed to inculcate the prerequisite skills among prospective students for success in the gateway courses. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is in response to observable enrollment and course completion data, results of academic support programs, and student surveys. It will implement a cyclical model as the framework to integrate computational thinking and programming concepts in learning modules and to assess learning outcomes. Faculty also will employ and assess the impact of learning techniques that have been proven effective for STEM students and develop future concepts relevant for Hampton and other institutions seeking to address similar problems.",
