 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Implementation project entitled: Graduation Academy - Transitioning STEM Students to Graduation and Graduate School at Norfolk State University builds on two successful previous implementation projects which resulted in significant gains in freshmen retention, in an innovative learning-living community and a comprehensive peer mentoring center. However, the progression of students from the sophomore level to the junior level has not been replicated at the institution. This project investigates multiple strategies to address that problem that is not uncommon for members of underrepresented groups. The Graduation Academy will feature a Sophomore summer bridge program, a Sophomore/Junior year prep program, a Graduation Academy for transfer students, Junior/Senior transition week, mentoring, scholarships and undergraduate research, and faculty development.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive evaluative process will produce insights into the challenges, best practices, and measures of anticipated outcomes. The evaluation plan will be based on the triangulation approach utilizing mixed-methods data gathering strategies of both qualitative and quantitative data. \r\n\r\nThe project will increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups who earn undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), pursue graduate study, and/or enter the STEM workforce. The summative evaluation will provide a view of the entire project, longitudinal progression toward project goals, and lessons learned in retaining and graduating underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.",
