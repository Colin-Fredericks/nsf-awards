 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: The ocean's midwaters are the largest living space on the planet. The mesopelagic food web plays key roles in the biological carbon pump and the production of food for commercially harvested species, but its functioning is understudied because it is remote and technologically challenging to sample. Recent estimates indicate respiratory demand outstrips measured sinking particle supply by up to 2-3 orders of magnitude suggesting that some food inputs to the mesopelagic food web have been underestimated or missed. Suspended particles frequently are not sampled effectively and may be an overlooked food source. Because identifying the principal inputs of organic matter to the deep-sea food web is critical to understanding its function, the investigators  propose to evaluate the relative importance of suspended and sinking particles to the meso- and bathypelagic food web in the central North Pacific. They will characterize the isotopic compositions of specific groups of mesopelagic and bathypelagic zooplankton and micronekton, and identify the extent to which they consume suspended or sinking particles using mass balance approaches. The investigators recently have recognized differences in delta 15N and delta 13C values of amino acids (AA) of sinking and suspended particles; these patterns diverge with depth, providing a means to distinguish between food web pathways. The research will define the source-specific isotopic values of suspended and sinking particles at several depths from the surface to the bathypelagic and test proposed microbial mechanisms driving these depth patterns. At corresponding depths, MOCNESS trawls will sample diverse metazoa: zooplankton size fractions, plus targeted resident, migrating and likely suspension-feeding taxa of zooplankton and micronekton. Preliminary data suggest that suspended particles are a secondary food source, containing less labile organic matter than sinking particles that exhibit a seasonal cycle in flux in the central North Pacific. This study will determine if suspended particles become more important to zooplankton and micronekton during a time of year when sinking particle flux is low (Jan/Feb) in comparison to when it is high (Aug), allowing an evaluation of how temporal change in surface ocean productivity affects the functioning of mesopelagic food webs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent research has called for additional study of the ocean's deep midwaters. This study will provide new insights into the functioning of the meso- and bathypelagic food web and its coupling with surface ocean processes in the central North Pacific. The recently-demonstrated ecological tool of amino acid-specific isotopic analysis will provide a novel and comprehensive approach with which to address our hypotheses, and the project will develop the first AA isotopic dataset spanning particles to fish. Results will help identify the ecological underpinnings of increasing delta 15N values with depth in zooplankton -- apparently a common pattern. Zooplankton consumption of suspended particles also could constitute a mechanistic link between the microbial loop and higher trophic levels. The processes controlling the enormous attenuation of particle flux by mesopelagic consumers -- and thereby the strength of carbon sequestration to the deep ocean -- are not understood. Seasonal sampling will help us relate mesopelagic food web processes to changes in surface ocean productivity, furthering our understanding of future climate change impacts on deep-sea food webs and carbon flux. With regard to fisheries, many oceanic top predators such as tuna and swordfish feed on mesopelagic micronekton. A clearer understanding of the structure of mesopelagic food webs will help inform ecosystem models which are used to understand variation in fisheries production.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will provide excellent training opportunities in leadership, research and outreach for an early-career female investigator (Close), a female postdoctoral researcher and for a graduate student and an undergraduate student. Broader societal impacts of our work relate to fisheries and climate change, subjects of great interest to the public, and many of the animals we will study, such as squid and anglerfishes, are very charismatic. The investigators will broadly communicate their results through two mass media venues. Voices of the Sea is a local TV program, with potential distribution to PBS that will highlight the research in two episodes. Second, the PIs will act as advisors for a new international TV series, David Attenborough's \"Natural Curiosities\" that will reach millions of viewers internationally.",
