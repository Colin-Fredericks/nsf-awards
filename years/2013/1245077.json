 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements discovery-based laboratory modules in a large, multi-section introductory biology course  at two Armstrong campuses, the main Armstrong Atlantic campus and the satellite Liberty Center Campus. The lab modules involve students in applying a suite of molecular biology techniques to screen Wolbachia from insects gathered by the students.   It is based on a set of modules originally developed for high school laboratories and then up-graded and tested, by the PIs, in an honors introductory biology laboratory.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project represents one of the many approaches being introduced into student laboratories that give students a taste of being part of the scientific process at the same time it benefits the scientific community by adding to an important data base.  Laboratories are being used to help reinforce understanding of basic biology principles that are difficult for students to understand.  In addition students are learning to work in collaborative groups to develop hypotheses, complete literature searches, make observations, perform cellular/molecular techniques, use laboratory equipment, collect and analyze data, make conclusions, work on presentation skills, and formulate future questions. The proposed exercises also provide opportunities to develop mathematics, chemistry, computer science, and bioinformatics skills, further engaging students in the interdisciplinary nature of biology. The work is being coordinated with initiatives started through existing awards in two other NSF programs, a Noyce and a STEP award, resulting in much greater efficiency in use of resources.  Workshops will be developed and offered to acquaint faculty (~25) with the laboratory modules and their delivery to the students. A rigorous evaluation plan will be implemented to assess student and faculty gains from the LEAPS project and results will be disseminated through appropriate educational journals. All course and workshop materials will be available for other institutions to adopt thereby increasing the impact of the project on the greater STEM teaching and learning community.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:   Successful implementation in 35 lab sections per year at two Armstrong campuses is demonstrating the feasibility of transference of individual modules or the entire lab sequence to similar institutions, especially those with urban, open-enrollment student populations. Novel laboratory exercises and overall project results are being disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at educational conferences. Several measurable outcomes have been incorporated into the evaluation plan and therefore inform the STEM community about the benefits of engaging large numbers of introductory-level students in discovery-based activities.",
