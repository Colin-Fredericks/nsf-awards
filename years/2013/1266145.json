Phong, who has worked on a wide range of fields within analysis, complex geometry and mathematical physics. Major themes of the conference include the complex Monge-Ampere equation, the Ricci flow, canonical metrics in geometry and integrable structures in modern mathematical physics. There will be 30 speakers in the five days of the conference, each of them experts in analysis, complex geometry and/or mathematical physics. The list of well-known and distinguished mathematicians will help the conference attract a large number of participants from all over the US. It is proposed that priority for travel funding will be given to graduate students, other junior mathematicians and those from underrepresented groups. The conference will be widely advertised to attract a diverse and broad spectrum of participation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project was to provide funding for the conference \"Analysis, Complex Geometry and Mathematical Physics:  A conference in honor of Duong H. Phong,\" May 7-11, 2013 at Columbia University in New York.  This was a high-profile international conference in mathematics and mathematical physics, bringing together thirty speakers from across the world.  The conference featured many distinguished and well-known mathematicians, including four winners of the prestigious Fields Medal.  The conference had more than 150 confirmed participants.  More than half of the participants were graduate students, postdoctoral scholars or junior faculty members.  The audience also included more than 25 members of underrepresented groups.\n\nThis project provided funding for a number of speakers and attendees to travel to and stay in New York for the duration of the conference.  This included 36 junior participants and 10 female mathematicians.  By exposing early-career and women mathematicians to the cutting-edge of mathematical research, the conference has had a significant impact on their training and career development.\n\nThe conference took place in the Mathematics Department of Columbia University over a period of 5 days.  There were 6 research talks each day, with ample breaks to allow for mathematical discussions.  The talks of the conference focused on recent developments in the mathematical theories of analysis and complex geometry and their connections to mathematical physics. \n\nAnalysis and complex geometry are central fields in mathematics and provide the basic tools for understanding the fundamental physical laws of the universe.  The physical theory known as String Theory gives a way to consolidate our understanding of particle physics with Einstein\u00c6s theory of gravity.  This theory requires the analysis of higher-dimensional geometric objects and the structures that live on them.  Many of the talks of the conference were concerned with developing this rich mathematical theory, thus helping to provide a solid framework for the language of modern particle physics.  This conference brought together pure mathematicians and mathematical physicists and helped to foster communication and discussion across these disciplines.\n\nIn addition to the thirty research talks, a volume of conference proceedings will appear.  This has been given preliminary approval by the publisher AMS Contemporary Mathematics.  This volume will help to disseminate the research outcomes of the conference. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Weinkove"
