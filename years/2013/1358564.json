 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This research project aims to achieve a greater understanding of erbium optical centers in the wide bandgap semiconductor GaN. The approach utilizes the magneto-optical techniques to study the microscopic structure of these centers.\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed work involves theoretical and experimental investigations of the microscopic structure of optically active Er centers in GaN will be investigated using magneto-optical measurements. The study will focus on the Zeeman effect on photoluminescence lines associated with erbium centers in GaN as a function of magnetic field strength. Several approaches combining analytical and simulation techniques for the magnetic field-induced splitting of the photoluminescence lines will be utilized. The individual g-tensors of ground and excited states of the erbium optical centers will be determined. The study will focus on the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio of the high and the low energy components at high magnetic fields. The information will provide a detailed description of the microscopic structure of the optical centers.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nIf successful, the research will lead to a greater understanding of erbium optical centers in GaN semiconductor films. This information is crucial for future photonic/optoelectronic applications, including optical amplifiers, optical communication systems, solid state lighting devices, and quantum information processing systems. The proposed research also impacts training graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary areas of photonics, material science and devices.\r\nThe research results will be incorporated into courses offered by the PIs in both Optics and Nanoscience programs.",
