This conference will focus on applying basic science and engineering principles from diverse areas including materials science and mechanical engineering and stem cell biology toward potential solving of clinically relevant biomedical problems. The program will provide  cutting-edge scientific program and discussion forum that focus on specific fundamental and applied science and engineering challenges that, when overcome, will facilitate the translation of biomaterials and tissue engineering sciences to clinical medicine. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe program serves both to educate the biomaterials and tissue engineering community in the highly relevant field of developmental biology and to stimulate discussion in current approaches from materials research, engineering and biological perspectives. The conference has not only excellent geographical diversity, but also includes many women, young PIs, and industrial researchers among the invited speakers and discussion leaders. An outstanding aspect of this year's conference is the inclusion of the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for the first time for this Seminar series. This 2013 Gordon Research Conference Seminar on Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering will be handled entirely by post-doctoral scientists and students. They will have opportunity to interact with leading scientists throughout the conference, and will be able to present their own work.",
