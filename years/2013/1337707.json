 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is cofunded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Chaoyang Jiang from University of South Dakota and colleagues Dongming Mei, Paul May and Ranjit Koodali will acquire a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attachment for elemental analysis and mapping. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) plasmonic enhancement of near-infrared-to-visible luminescence; (b) thin films by laser assisted chemical vapor deposition; (c) cubic mesoporous materials with varied morphologies; (d) cuprous oxide nanoparticles; (e) fluorinated polymeric materials for air-stable and moisture-resistant flexible optoelectronics; (f) metal-semiconductor hybrid nanocrystals for solar fuels catalysis; (g) dissociation density characterization and wafer processing of ultrapure germanium single crystals; (h) research on the pigments in paintings on historical music instruments; and (i) materials characterization for earth science research.\r\n\r\nA scanning electron microscope (SEM) is one of the basic tools available for the characterization of materials. A beam of electrons scans the surface of a sample resulting in a microimage of the sample composition. The electron microscope can provide higher resolution and magnification than a microscope using light to probe the material. Characteristic X-rays are produced from interaction with atoms in the sample that when dispersed provide information on the elemental composition (EDS). This instrumentation will provide microscopy training and research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students across many fields including chemistry, earth sciences and environmental science fields preparing them for the demands of the 21st century workforce in science and technology. The instrumentation will impact research and research training of researchers and students not only at the University of South Dakota but also at neighboring institutions and tribal colleges such as Barrett Eichler, Augustana College; Carl Fictorie, Dordt College (Sioux City, Iowa); and Subodh Singh and Sinte Gleska University.",

For example, SEM was used to monitor the size uniformity of upconversion nanoparticles in a scale-up synthesis procedure for security applications. Since its installation in May 2015, the SEM has imaged over 1300 samples, which has resulted in the publication of five papers and two patents so far. &nbsp;Additional papers in various stages of preparation will soon be submitted. SEM data has also helped to secure additional grants from multiple funding agencies to support research activities in advanced materials.

These graduate students worked on various nanostructured samples for their research projects, and SEM work has been included in their respective theses or dissertations.</p>\n<p>SEM microscopy has also been introduced in several courses taken by both graduate and undergraduate students. Our graduate courses, CHEM 720 (Synthesis and Characterization of Nanostructured Materials) and CHEM 730 (Advanced Analytical Chemistry), involve SEM characterization. In the summer of 2016, a graduate level course, CHEM 729 (Advanced Electron Microscopy), provided 12 hours of hands on experience to each of the participants. In our undergraduate program, CHEM 116 (Honors General Chemistry) in the fall of 2016 and 2017, and CHEM 429 (Advanced Chemical Characterization) in the spring of 2017 allowed our undergraduate students to interact with advanced instrumentation (including SEM) for nanoscale characterization. We also conducted a two-day workshop on electron microscopy for undergraduate students who participated in summer research including students supported by an ongoing NSF REU site program in the Department. The SEM lab also attracts other visitors for a number of different events including: a recruiting open house, summer research orientation and workshops, and high school visits. During fall of 2017, more than 100 students and their teachers from four local high schools visited USD Chemistry to conduct a nanoparticle synthesis and learn about characterizing materials using SEM.&nbsp; Six more high schools have expressed interest in visiting next spring. &nbsp;The SEM lab is and will continue to be a hot spot to help amaze new generations and hopefully can attract new students to STEM fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chaoyang&nbsp;Jiang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059854754_UCNPs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059854754_UCNPs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Upconversion Nanocrystals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059854754_UCNPs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Upconversion Nanocrystals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Upconversion Nanocrystals</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aravind Baride</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chaoyang&nbsp;Jiang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Upconversion Nanocrystals</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059951773_GoldNS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059951773_GoldNS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gold nanostars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512059951773_GoldNS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gold nanostars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Gold nanostars</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xianghua Meng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chaoyang&nbsp;Jiang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gold nanostars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512060130414_dentaltublues--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512060130414_dentaltublues--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dental tublues\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1337707/1337707_10283055_1512060130414_dentaltublues--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dental tublues\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dental tublues</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aravind Baride</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chaoyang&nbsp;Jiang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dental tublues</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
