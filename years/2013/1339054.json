 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential for further development of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single crystals will be explored. Single crystals of hBN are potentially transformative materials because of their unique properties and applications as a graphene substrate, a neutron detector, and as UV-LED semiconductors. Some of the unique properties of hBN include its ability to emit deep-UV light (as low as 215 nm), its large thermal neutron capture cross section (due to the strong interaction between thermal neutrons (~25 meV) and the 20% naturally occurring boron-10 isotope), and a crystal structure that is similar to graphene (including the smallest known lattice mismatch of only +1.7%), making it an excellent substrate for graphene. However, electronic and optoelectronic device applications exploiting these properties have been hampered by the small size, poor crystal quality, and high impurity content commercially available hBN. \r\n\r\nThe hBN single crystals produced in this project could enable the development of new types of devices exploiting its properties including deep-UV emitters (for non-thermal sterilization and water purification), solid state neutron detectors (for homeland security, first responders, and treaty verification), and as an excellent electrically insulating substrate for grapheme integrated electronics and sensors. This project will explore the widespread use and practical application opportunities afforded by these hBN single crystals with the goal of manufacturing the crystals on a large scale.",
