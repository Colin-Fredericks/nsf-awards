 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Southern California's Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC) located on Catalina Island, CA. The proposed 8-week summer internship program will provide laboratory and field-based research expertise to eight undergraduate students from across the nation each summer for three years.  The \"Sustainability of Coastal Ocean Systems REU\" (SCOS-REU) program will provide exposure to multiple activities that provide an integrated context for interdisciplinary undergraduate training related to the sustainability of coastal oceans. The first week of the program will focus on whole-group training, including a short course in marine science and an oceanographic shake-down cruise. Students will then embark on independent research programs with faculty and \"near-peer\" mentors. Student projects will contribute to larger, funded research programs by their mentors related to understanding of human impacts on environmental systems and be capped with a student research seminar. In addition to independent research, participants will work and learn as a team as they receive training in ecosystem ecology and function, the scientific method, methodological approaches and career and professional development. Periodic field trips to different parts the island and ecosystems will promote group cohesiveness and learning.",

Participants worked individually with their mentor teams  (faculty, grad students, experienced undergrads), and in some cases as  part of a larger, collaborative interdisciplinary group, to formulate  research questions and strategies. The designed research opportunities  helped undergraduates gain  confidence, training and see themselves as future STEM professionals.  Participants gained a broader understanding of coastal ocean science and  its relationship to sustainability, through peer-to-peer interactions  on specific research topics that spanned nutrient biogeochemistry,  marine organismal biology, the effectiveness of marine protected areas,  applications of geographic information systems, marine microbial  ecology, biology of invasive species, fisheries population ecology,  trace element chemistry, land use impacts, predator/prey studies,  population genetics, and environmental contamination and organism  toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader imapacts:</strong> We successfully attracted  participants from underrepresented populations and institutions that  have limited opportunities for undergraduate student research. In addition to research training, the USC  REU students received focused training in professional development  activities that promote STEM readiness, i.e., science communication,  research ethics, approaches for graduate school and professional  application processes, networking, and non-academic career paths in  marine and coastal science. Heavy emphasis was placed on knowledge  transfer such as training REU students to train others in new skills and  concepts acquired through the program. USC REU alumni were also leaders  in large-scale outreach activities run by the USC Wrigley Institute for  other undergraduates, high-school students, and the general public.  This strategy reinforces a cycle of innovation: REUs learn from the  research base and the work of others, make changes in their own  practice, and share their results. The professional development model  resulted in the training of a larger student community about the value  of STEM-related research activities and exposure to expand into the  geoscience workforce. Our students were part of over 40 research presentations at local, regional and national meetings. Their research findings benefited faculty and graduate students, who were able to use REU project data in research proposals., publications, thesis/dissertation chapters and to develop more refined research questions for further evaluation.</p>\n</div>\n</dd></dl><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karla&nbsp;B&nbsp;Heidelberg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863307333_1_REUsatthebeach--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863307333_1_REUsatthebeach--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REUs having a little fun\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863307333_1_REUsatthebeach--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REUs having a little fun\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2014 USC Wrigley Institute REU cohort on Catalina Island showing their excitement for science</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Diane Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karla&nbsp;B&nbsp;Heidelberg</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REUs having a little fun</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863489261_2_MaddieGuestdiving--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863489261_2_MaddieGuestdiving--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"USC REU student Maddie Guest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263356/1263356_10237804_1497863489261_2_MaddieGuestdiving--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"USC REU student Maddie Guest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Southern California Senior Madison Guest participated in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center during summer 2016.
