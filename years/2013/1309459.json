 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: Plasmonic near-fields can be used to increase exciton generation or emission rate in organic conjugated polymer semiconductor materials. However, to incorporate plasmonic effects in conjugated polymer-based optoelectronic devices, it is important to control and stabilize the surface electronic properties of the plasmonic structure. The goal of this project is to develop design principles for multifunctional plasmonic electrodes that are: (1) optically active; (2) efficient at charge carrier collection/injection; (3) stable under ambient conditions; and (4) compatible with scalable nanofabrication routes for organic polymer optoelectronic applications. The plasmonic electrodes consist of vertically-oriented metal nanorod arrays that support surface plasmons and that are either uncoated or have an ultra-thin (native) metal oxide coating to tune the surface work function, eliminate the need for additional hole transport/electron blocking layers, mitigate exciton quenching, and improve performance lifetime in ambient conditions.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: The electrodes developed in this project, that provide light management capabilities and that exhibit stable, controllable surface electronic properties, are expected to enable both more efficient and more durable organic polymer-based optoelectronic devices, making them more viable for energy efficiency and generation applications. The project activities also combine interdisciplinary research in materials science and engineering, and chemistry with education by enabling undergraduate students from local and state programs (such as Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering program, Rutgers' Green Energy Technology REU program and the New Jersey Governor's School of Engineering and Technology) to work alongside graduate researchers on the goals of the project. Additional project activities continue to support, encourage and maintain diversity in the research team and in the broader scientific community; and incorporate participation in high-school enrichment as part of Rutgers' outreach programs.",
