The week includes a number of co-located conferences that are the main meetings for the international community doing empirical research in the field of Software Engineering. More information can be found at http://umbc.edu/eseiw2013/.   Empirical Software Engineering has the potential to be an increasingly productive and transformative part of the Software Engineering research landscape, because the quantity of usable/analyzable data has increased dramatically just over the last few years. Repositories and community development sites are become more common and larger. Tools for mining and analyzing Software Engineering data are appearing and accelerating the pace of research.   NSF's support of student travel will increase intellectual advances in the field and create broader impacts including improvements in software engineering and global experiences for the future workforce.",
