 "awd_abstract_narration": "1252854\r\nSaucerman\r\n\r\nA python's heart grows by a remarkable 40% a mere 48 hours after feeding, returning to normal\r\nsize on a similar timescale. But in humans and other mammals, exposure to pathological\r\nstress such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) leads to a detrimental and irreversible form of\r\nheart growth that ultimately leads to heart failure. Because postnatal cardiac myocytes generally\r\ndo not proliferate, heart growth is due to an enlargement of existing cells, termed hypertrophy.\r\nThe myocyte hypertrophy response is controlled by a complex web of biochemical signaling\r\npathways, triggered by a range of neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines and mechanical\r\nstimuli. While many individual pieces of this network have been discovered, major advances\r\nare required to achieve a quantitative understanding of how these molecular circuits work and\r\nhow they may be controlled therapeutically. Thus there is an urgent need for new\r\napproaches, both theoretical and experimental, that allow such integrative understanding.\r\nYet systems biology approaches to date have been most focused on more tractable model\r\norganisms and cell lines, with much less work done on biochemical networks\r\nregulating the heart.\r\n\r\nHere, new computational and experimental systems approaches will be developed to\r\nunderstand how extracellular signals drive physiological and pathological myocyte remodeling.\r\nDr. Saucerman's lab has adapted techniques from image processing to perform the first highthroughput\r\nmicroscopy of cardiac myocyte morphology, identifying distinct forms of hypertrophy\r\ndepending on the stimulated receptor. In parallel, they have developed the first largescale\r\ncomputational model of the hypertrophy signaling network, predicting that PI3K and Ras\r\nare key network decision points. The research objective of this proposal is to test the\r\noverall hypothesis that the balance of PI3K and Ras signaling determines how diverse\r\nreceptors induce distinct forms of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. This hypothesis will be\r\ntested by 1) experimentally measuring and perturbing PI3K and Ras signaling to determine their\r\ndistinct regulation of myocyte size, shape and sarcomeric organization; 2) training a\r\ncomputational model of hypertrophy signaling based on biochemical and morphological data;\r\nand 3) applying the model to predict and then experimentally validate signaling mechanisms\r\nthat mediate the distinct roles for PI3K and Ras in hypertrophy signaling.\r\n\r\nThe training of individuals ranging from high school students through postdoctoral\r\nresearchers is highly integrated into this program. Specific educational aims include: 1)\r\nmentoring of undergraduate students in graduate-level research; and 2) outreach to high school\r\nstudents from underrepresented populations, particularly in developing original computational\r\nmodels of cardiac signaling networks. This training is aided by user-friendly network modeling\r\nsoftware and accompanying problem-based learning curricular materials.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research will integrate new computational and experimental approaches\r\nto identify PI3K and Ras as network decision points for myocyte size, shape, and sarcomeric\r\norganization. The educational program is innovative in graduate-level research by\r\nundergraduates and in problem-based learning of systems biology with high school students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This research is expected to identify new potential therapeutic targets for\r\ncardiac hypertrophy. The educational program will provide mentoring for underrepresented high\r\nschool students and undergraduates, enhancing their career development. Modeling software\r\nand curricular materials will make these approaches accessible to a much larger community.\r\nFurther impact will ultimately be achieved by the scientific achievements and career successes\r\nof diverse trainees.",
