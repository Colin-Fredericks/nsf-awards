Attendance by U.S. mathematicians at this meeting is important for the scientific health of the nation because U.S. mathematicians discuss, learn and share in mathematical research that is going on all over the world. The Society has administered similar travel grant programs for previous ICM gatherings, beginning with ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan and most recently for ICM-2010 in Hyderabad, India. The program ensures that there is strong attendance by U.S. mathematicians, promoting contact with mathematical scientists from other parts of the world, which is important not only for the education of future mathematicians, but also for the long-term vitality of mathematical research in the United States. In addition, efforts will be made to ensure that early career mathematicians, women and minorities receive full consideration to support their attendance.",

Twenty-nine percent of the 51 awards chosen by the Selection Committee were women; 43% of the original 90 awards went to early career mathematicians.   Later, six additional awards were given to individuals on a ranked wait list prepared by the Selection Committee. Applicants were notified via email of their awards in February 2014.
