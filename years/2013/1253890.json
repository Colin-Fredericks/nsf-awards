By developing flexible, biocompatible polymer-based optoelectronic scaffolds\r\n(OPTELS) a strategy for incorporating individual optically sensitive neurons into neural\r\nrecording and stimulation devices will be created. These trapped neurons will be\r\ninvestigated as relays of optical stimulation or inhibition to intact neural networks, which\r\nwill potentially enable future clinical applications of optogenetics, a powerful optical\r\nneural stimulation tool, without genetic modification of the patient. Specifically the\r\nproject will be focused on the following objectives: (1) Developing fiber-inspired\r\nfabrication methods for hollow-core polymer-based OPTELS and employing them to\r\nisolate key materials parameters (surface geometry, charge, flexibility) contributing to\r\nsurvival and growth of electronically active neurons; (2) Using OPTELS to investigate\r\nand control neuronal growth with the goal of axonal guidance along the OPTELS core.\r\nThe proposed study will explore chemical, optoelectronic and mechanical stimuli and\r\nemploy OPTELS ability to record and stimulate neural activity to determine factors\r\ncontributing to axonal growth; (3) Employing neurons trapped in OPTELS cores as relay\r\ndevices of optical neural interrogation. Genetic modification will be applied to the\r\nneurons trapped within the OPTELS cores to enable expression of light-sensitive ion\r\nchannels - opsins. The controlled formation of synapses between these relay neurons\r\nand the outside networks will be applied to the investigation of optogenetic interrogation\r\nof the network without directly genetically modifying it.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will explore materials interfaces between optoelectronic devices\r\nand neural tissues providing a pathway towards intimate physiological neuroprosthetic\r\ndevices for treatment of debilitating neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease\r\nor spinal cord injury. The educational and outreach components of the project are\r\ndesigned to enhance materials engineering and optoelectronics education at MIT and at\r\ninner city community colleges through classroom training and hands-on laboratory\r\ninternships. Specifically the outreach program aims to increase awareness about the\r\nimpact of engineering in medicine among community college students and teachers\r\nthrough the seminar series \"Medical Electronics and Optics: Life-saving Engineering\",\r\nand 10-week research and education summer internships in the PIs laboratory. In\r\naddition new lecture material and device-design based assignments will be developed\r\nfor the core undergraduate course on optical and electronic materials and a graduate\r\nphotonics course will be adapted to senior undergraduates with the goal of advancing\r\noptoelectronics knowledge among the students. The educational materials will be made\r\navailable to worldwide community of learners through an open MIT web-based\r\nresource.",
