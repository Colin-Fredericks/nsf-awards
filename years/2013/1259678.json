 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent introduction of genetic methods into political science impels the need for training the larger political science community in these methods. Despite increasing availability of data and publications that integrate politics and genetics, very few political scientists are trained in the methodologies needed to review, evaluate, critique, or take part in this burgeoning area of research. Moreover, for political scientists interested in this growing area of political behavior, there are few avenues to pursue training; to date, no existing political science programs, methods workshops or other curricula offer (or are qualified to offer) training in genetics and familial modeling. Our project addresses these deficiencies by supporting dedicated opportunities for political scientists to attend the Institute of Behavioral Genetics (IBG)'s annual methods workshop at the University of Colorado-Boulder over the next four years. The most critical benefit of this program will be the introduction of methods for genetic analysis to a broader population of mainstream political scientists. These individuals will in turn have the tools to train future graduate students, include familial modeling their coursework, conduct primary research, write new grants, supervise theses, and review grants, articles, and other scholarship. In addition, the training will have spillover effects in facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration between political scientists and scholars in psychology, genetics, and other fields where such partnerships have been rare. Exposing and training more political scientists in behavior genetics will also open doors to funding from different sources, and to a wider range of publication venues for scholars conducting this research. Importantly, for political scientists, this type of training may also help to dissipate notions of determinism that surround genetics research, while for geneticists, it may help dispel the notion that social science is anti-science. The long-term impact will undoubtedly be to spawn new interest in these areas, create a long-term investment in behavioral work with a genetic component, and to make better reviewers and researchers.",
