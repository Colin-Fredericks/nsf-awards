Tyler\r\nProposal Number: 1337033 /1336445\r\nInstitution: Tennessee Technological University/ Oklahoma State University\r\nTitle: Collaborative Research: A Multi-Scale Environmental and Kinetics Study on the Pyrolysis of Sustainable Biomass Feedstock\r\n\r\nA multi-scale, interdisciplinary study on the kinetics and socio-economic broader impacts of biomass pyrolysis is proposed. This research will bring together five disciplines; Chemical and Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Sociology and Agriculture. Most experimental techniques focus on meso-scale (mg) or larger quantities of raw material and mostly ignore external and internal transport conditions of the sample.  The PIs propose a unique experimental technique and to introduce a Multiple Variable Control Volume Reactor (MVCVR) concept.  In combination with technology for producing individual micro-spheres of biomass, the PIs propose to utilize the MVCVR to independently control the particle-related (intra-particle) and homogenous- related (extra-particle) transport phenomena and associated reactions, thereby making it possible to independently observe the two processes. A series of experiments are proposed wherein model compounds (e.g. levoglucosan and other carbohydrates), separated components (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and whole biomass are studied in an effort to understand the extent to which pyrolysis occurs within condensed phase intermediates and the homogeneous gas phase. The PIs also propose to introduce a new multi-scale modeling platform based on kinetic cellular automaton (KCA) and to demonstrate the applicability of this robust modeling strategy for simulating microstructure evolution in pyrolyzing biomass. Molecular-scale computational strategies will be used in parallel to supplement experiments and validate mechanistic hypotheses for up-scaling to KCA.\r\n\r\nThe data collected in this research will contribute to the scientific and engineering advancements currently being sought globally for the expanding biofuels industry and development of associated technology for direct thermochemical conversion of biomass-to-liquid fuels (BTL) and chemicals. Such will be elements of tomorrow?s integrated biorefineries (biochemical and thermochemical conversion under one roof) currently at the pilot and demonstration stages. For this reason the proposed work will focus on pyrolysis of whole biomass from crops with significantly reduced agricultural input requirements and residues, so as not to compete with agriculturally demanding food crops, such as corn and oilseeds.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will integrate elements of socio-economics and to provide a unique PhD experience that will greatly broaden the impact of this effort.  The PIs also will include undergraduates as an integral part of the research team along the critical path. A major goal of the project is to communicate with, and gather information from, farming communities in central Tennessee. This element of the proposed research focuses on documenting and understanding the perceptions of the farming community regarding the possibility of allocating local farmland for growing energy crops. Information such as: amount of local farming land, common farming practices in terms of tillage, type of crops grown, amount of crop residues, and whether farmers are willing to grow dedicated energy crops (e.g., switchgrass), use their poor-quality crops for energy conversion, or whether they are willing to participate at all, will be gathered. The broader impacts of such an activity, while regionally-specific, are fundamental for the overall success of a sustainable biofuels industry. For the transition from a fossil resource- to a bio resource-based economy to happen, a well-informed and educated public is critical. Biopyrolysis-based fuels and chemicals research provides many unique opportunities for vertically integrated educational activities.",

One option is to extract carbon from deliberately grown energy crops using pyrolysis, a form of controlled heating.  Under specific heating conditions, woody plant matter can be converted into a range of useful carbon-rich starting materials including gases, oils and char.  Our research focused on understanding some of the most fundamental transformations that occur when woody biomass is heated in the absence of air. \n\n In an effort to scale-up processes to make them economic at large throughputs, it is many times necessary to study them at very, very small length and time scales sometimes referred to as intrinsic scales.  Intrinsic information describes the underlying events (mechanisms) that control how and what happens.\n\n When biomass is pyrolized &ndash; that is decomposed into chemical fragments using heat &ndash; many transformations occur and the residual matter shrinks, eventually forming a charcoal-like substance called char.  These changes, call morphological changes, happen at a microscopic and even nanoscopic scale.  Our work focused on how these transformations happen. \n\n Our team developed a new way to study biomass pyrolysis by manufacturing tiny spheres of whole biomass and purified biomass components such as cellulose.  Why do we need spheres?  Raw biomass includes herbaceous crops (grasses) and wood.  These raw forms are irregular and cannot directly be reduced to regular shapes on a scale small enough to study intrinsic properties.  Our process starts by reducing raw forms of biomass to a very, very fine flour by milling.  The milled flour is then mixed with a suitable liquid to form what is referred to as a slurry or mixture of solid and liquid, and then sprayed to form many, many tiny droplets of the slurry.  The liquid evaporates from the droplets and as it does the finely milled solid particles, much smaller than even the tiny droplets, coalesce to form nearly perfect spheres, see Figure 1.\n\n To study pyrolysis our team pyrolyzed one microsphere at a time, a very small amount of matter weighing no more than 10 mg (ten millionths of a gram).  To do this we designed a small reactor system to very rapidly heat a single microsphere to temperatures between 500 and 1000 oC.  The reactor is simple, a flow of gas propels a single microsphere of biomass into a preheated chamber where it is trapped; pyrolysis occurs and the vapors are swept through by the flowing gas and into a detector.  Figure 2 illustrates the concept.\n\n The particle temperature is not directly measured. Instead, our team developed mathematical models that enabled us to predict the particle temperature.  The model predictions combined with data from the gas detector enabled our team to make detailed measurements of the fast pyrolysis reaction rate for single microspheres, an outcome that we believe is the first of its kind, refer to Figure 3.
