 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Rolando Roque-Malherbe from Universidad Del Turabo and colleagues Agustin Rios, Anastacio Emiliano and Cesar Lozano will acquire an automatic high pressure physisorption analyzer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) metal organic frameworks for methane storage; (b) Prussian blue analogues for small molecules separation from gas flows; and (c) pore size augmented nitroprussides for carbon dioxide storage.\r\n\r\nA high pressure physisorption analyzer takes advantage of the very weak attractive interactions between molecules, which arise from  so-called van der Waals interactions. In general, high pressure is applied to a gas in contact with a solid substrate. As the pressure increases, the gas molecules are attracted to various degrees by the substrate. Under appropriate conditions, these weak interactions allow separation of gases. If additionally the pores of the substrate are manipulated, the interactions may increase and such solids may be used to store gases. Useful examples are those of carbon dioxide, which may contribute to global warming and may serve as feedstock for chemical reactions under concentrated conditions.",
