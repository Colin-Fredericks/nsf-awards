 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a novel dynamic window technology for energy efficient buildings. Dynamic windows can accomplish three essential functions.  First, they can efficiently harvest visible light to minimize electricity use during daylight.  Second, they block solar heat from entering buildings in the summertime and thus can lower energy use for cooling.  Third, in the wintertime, they let heat in to reduce heating costs. These innovative windows are inspired by the mature heat pipe and novel photonic crystal technologies.  Heat pipes have been widely used in managing the flow of heat in a wide range of products such as air conditioners and refrigerators.  Photonic crystal is a new class of optical materials designed for controlling the flow of light. A scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will also be developed for making large-area photonic crystal coatings on window glass.  \r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to significant breakthroughs in improving energy efficiency of windows for both residential and commercial buildings.  Windows are one of the main sources of energy loss in buildings.  On average, they account for 36 percent of overall building heating and cooling loads.  Consequently, this research will contribute to reduce the consumption of oil, natural gas, and electricity needed to power buildings. This could greatly enhance the energy security of the United States.  Buildings contribute about 40 percent of U.S. carbon emission. This novel dynamic window technology could significantly reduce their impact on the environment.  Moreover, the scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will advance many other areas ranging from high-speed optical computing to ultrasensitive bio-sensing, where the inexpensive fabrication of large-area periodic nanostructures is important.",

In order to fabricate large-area NIR-active photonic crystal coatings on window glass, which are the critical components of the functional dynamic windows, two scalable nanomanufacturing platforms based on a roll-to-roll-compatible doctor blade coating (DBC) technique and a continuous electrostatics-assisted Langmuir-Blodgett coating approach have been developed in this program. In addition to the technological development, fundamental colloidal crystallization mechanisms involving in these bottom-up nanomanufacturing platforms have also been systematically investigated by both experiments (e.g., rheology measurements) and theoretical modeling. To achieve dynamic and independent control of visible and NIR light for the dynamic windows, a new light regulating mechanism has been demonstrated in this project. It is based on a series of newly discovered shape memory polymers (SMPs) that can regulate light between a highly transmissive state (temporary configuration) and a highly reflective state (permanent configuration). Strong capillary interactions including capillary pressures induced by the evaporation of liquids (e.g., water) entrapped in the macroporous photonic crystals and capillary condensation/evaporation of fluids in the interconnecting macropores are utilized in controlling the photonic crystal microstructures and the associate optical properties of the smart coatings. Once again, significant fundamental insights have been gained in these topics that have received little or no prior examination, but are technologically important in many applications, such as carbon dioxide sequestration in deep geological formations and advanced polymer reverse osmosis membranes for water purification, through both experiments and theoretical simulations. This grant has resulted in more than 20 peer-reviewed publications on high-profile journals, like <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Advanced Materials</em>, etc., and 5 pending U.S. patent applications. Two of these patented technologies on dynamic light regulating coatings have been licensed by an industrial partner &ndash; Innovative Space Technologies (IST).
