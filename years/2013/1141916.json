 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to establish an ice shelf network of 18 broadband seismographs deployed for two years to obtain high-resolution, mantle-scale images of Earth structure underlying the Ross Sea Embayment. Prior marine geophysical work provides good crustal velocity models for the region seaward of the ice shelf but mantle structure is constrained by only low-resolution images due to the lack of prior seismic deployments. The proposed stations would be established between Ross Island and Marie Byrd Land. These stations would fill a major geological gap within this extensional continental province and would link data sets collected in the Transantarctic Mountain transition/Plateau region (TAMSEIS) and in West Antarctica (POLENET) to improve resolution of mantle features beneath Antarctica. The proposed deployment would allow the PIs to collect seismic data without the expense, logistical complexity, and iceberg hazards associated with ocean bottom seismograph deployments. Tomographic models developed from the proposed data will be used to choose between competing models for the dynamics of the Ross Sea. In particular, the PIs will investigate whether a broad region of hot mantle, including the Eastern Ross Sea, indicates distributed recent tectonic activity, which would call into question models proposing that Eastern Ross extension ceased during the Mesozoic. These data will also allow the PIs to investigate the deeper earth structure to evaluate the possible role of mantle plumes and/or small-scale convection in driving regional volcanism and tectonism across the region.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\n\r\nData from this deployment will be of broad interdisciplinary use. This project will support three graduate and two undergraduate students. At least one student will be an underrepresented minority student. The PIs will interact with the media and include K-12 educators in their fieldwork.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIce shelves are massive floating glacial membranes, fed by offshore glacial flow.  They may be up to hundreds of meters thick and extend for many hundreds of kilometers laterally. Ice shelves are especially important in that they affect the ocean and atmosphere environment around much of the Antarctic coast and also provide a buttressing effect that restrains the flow of land ice into the ocean.  If ice shelves degrade this flow has been shown to increase in rate and to enhance glacial melt contributions to sea level rise.  We deployed a two-year network of highly sensitive seismographs across the extent of the world's largest shelf, the Ross Ice Shelf, to study its vibrations, which originate from ocean, atmosphere, and solid Earth (earthquakes or icequake) phenomena.  We discovered that ocean waves can noticeably disturb the ice shelf all the way to its grounding line (which can be hundreds of km from the coast), which indicates that wave agitation can exert an appreciable influence on these shelves.  We also discovered or described a number of elastic wave phenomena that propagate within the ice shelf itself, and how such measurements can assist in monitoring its long-term integrity.  Finally, we made the first extensive recordings of distant earthquakes (\"teleseisms\") on the ice shelf and have applied these measurements to further study the large-scale geological structure of the ice-covered continent to better understand its geological history and present state.  Measurement of the mantle to depths of hundreds of kilometers is important to understanding how fast the land rebounds as ice mass is lost (which is presently occurring at a rate of tens of cubic km/year) due to climate change.  This rebound is an important stabilizing factor against accelerating ice loss due from the West Antarctic ice Sheet.  However, although these results indicate that this \"glacial isostatic adjustment\" is occurring at a much higher rate than has been previously widely appreciated, is not yet clear to what extent it will slow what now appears to be an ongoing process of West Antarctic ice sheet mass collapse due to rising sea temperatures, and attendant significant contributions to global sea level rise, particularly in the northern hemisphere.  More refined modeling incorporating our results should result in increasingly accurate estimates of this ongoing process and its global impacts on society during this century and beyond.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard C Aster"
