 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mark Ellison from Ursinus College and Dr. Michael Strano from MIT are supported by an award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to investigate the motion of ions and biologically relevant molecules through single-walled carbon nanotubes.  Using nanotube nanopore devices fabricated at MIT, they are conducting experiments to study fundamental properties of these systems and to assess their usefulness for the nanoscale detection and control of the flow of ions and molecules.  This research extends the knowledge of motion through nanopores to several important areas, including amino acids and small neutral molecules.  The research also enhances our understanding of the role of nanopore properties, such as the effects of functional groups at the pore mouth and nanopore surface charge on the motion of ions and molecules through nanopores.  The results of this research provide foundational knowledge of nanotube nanopores and take an important step toward utilizing them in practical devices.\r\n\r\nThe undergraduate researchers at Ursinus College involved in these projects attain a variety of scientific skills.  First, they obtain significant experience conducting experiments in nanoscience.  They also develop their abilities to formulate, test, and revise scientific hypotheses.  Additionally, the Ursinus students significantly benefit from the collaboration with MIT, which includes visits to MIT to conduct experiments with the high-grade research instrumentation there.  Students involved in this research will emerge as well-trained young scientists with the tools to approach a wide range of scientific questions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch conducted by students and professors at Ursinus College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studied the motion of molecules and ions through single-walled carbon nanotubes. (SWNTs)  SWNTs are a form of carbon rolled up into a tiny tube about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair.  You can think of these nanotubes as being the world?s smallest pipes.\n\nWe first found that methanol will flow rapidly through SWNTs.  This is interesting and important because methanol fuel cells could contribute to meeting our country?s goals for renewable energy.  A central part of a fuel cell is a membrane that separates the electrodes.  Our work shows that a membrane made of SWNTs could effectively deliver the methanol fuel in a methanol fuel cell and possibly increase the fuel cell?s efficiency.\n\nWe also found that amino acids would travel through carbon nanotubes. (We tested four amino acids: glycine, beta-alanine, valine, and glutamic acid.)  The amino acids appear to \"stick\" to the walls as they travel through the nanotube, which tells us about the interaction between the amino acid and the nanotube.  We measured this interaction and the time it took each type of amino acid to travel through the SWNT.  By using these measurements, we could identify which amino acid it was traveling through the SWNT.  Being able to identify amino acids by their transit properties could lead to medical applications.  For example, some illnesses lead to changes in amino acid levels in cells.  The fundamental knowledge gained by our research could have long-term applications in disease detection.\n\nThis research also had a significant impact on the people involved.  The Ursinus students who worked on this research used their laboratory experience to get accepted into graduate school, find jobs in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, or start a career teaching high school chemistry.  Additionally, five young women in high school worked on this research project.  Their experience with the research gave them the confidence to go to college and major in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Ellison"
