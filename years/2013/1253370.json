 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanomagnetic logic and memory have emerged as powerful alternatives to conventional transistor based circuits because a multiferroic nanomagnet, switched with electrically generated strain (\"straintronics\"), is a far more energy-efficient switch than a transistor. However, nanomagnetic logic is extremely error-prone at room temperature since thermal fluctuations can seriously disrupt magnetization dynamics during switching. In order to make nanomagnetic logic viable, the issue of high error rate must be addressed and a solution found to mitigate its deleterious effects. This project pursues an approach for reducing error rates without calling for impractical on-chip error-correction resources.\r\n \r\nThis research could enable processors to be built with superbly energy-efficient technology that can lead to implantable smart medical devices, button-sized face recognition systems, structural health monitoring systems, and consumer applications such as wearable electronics. A graduate course on nanoscale magnetism with an emphasis on nanomagnetic computing will be created. With the support of the Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering, minority high school students will be hosted in the Principle Investigator's lab every summer. The Principle Investigator will develop innovative hands-on workshops to explain nanomagnetic memory and logic to K-12 students from selected schools that have low representations in Virginia science fairs and will also transfer this knowledge and expertise to teachers from these schools. Science fair participation from such schools will be analyzed to study the impact of this 5-year innovative outreach effort in K-12 teaching.",

They are being explored as alternatives to conventional transistor-based computing devices as they are non-volatile, i.e. they can retain information after the power is switched off. Furthermore, such devices can be much more efficient than transistor-based devices, provided they are switched with energy efficient switching paradigms. In this work we explored two such paradigms strain mediated electrical control of magnetism (\"straintronics\") and direct electric field control using voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA). However, a more critical issue that prevents the widespread applications of such devices is the large switching error in the presence of thermal noise at room temperature and was the focus of this NSF grant. Towards this end, several strategies to address this issue in digital memory and logic devices were studied. The use of nanomagnets for neuromorphic computing, which are more robust to switching error, was also explored.</p>\n<p>In the early years of the grant, research focused on simulations of stochastic magnetization dynamics in the presence of thermal noise to understand the origin of the dynamic switching error in logic devices, particularly in dipole coupled nanomagnetic logic and pulse shaping strategies to alleviate these issues. However, it was found that stringent requirements for Boolean logic were hard to achieve, particularly when defects and inhomogeneities that pinned the magnetization exacerbated the problem as shown by experiments and micromagnetic simulations in later years of the grant. Different memory devices were also evaluated. One particular strain switched memory that involved using successive stress along different axes to produce a deterministic rotation of the magnetization to reverse it was found to be energy efficient and have low switching error acceptable for memory. Towards, the final states years of the grant alternative switching strategies such as skyrmion mediated VCMA switching of perpendicular nanomagnets were proposed, simulated and preliminary experimental work conducted.

It resulted in 33 journal papers including in 2 topical reviews and an article in Nature Electronics, 1 co-edited book, 2 patents and several national and international invited talks and contributed conference presentations. This grant partially supported several graduate students and partially supported the work of 4 PhD dissertations and 1 MS dissertation. A graduate course titled \"Nanomagnetism and nanomagnetic devices\" with application to computing devices was developed and taught in Fall 2015 and taught again in Fall 2017. The following K-12 outreach was performed: (1) Underrepresented K-12 students were hosted for a couple of weeks each summer through the Richmond Minority in Engineering (RMEP) program for four summers during this grant and mentored by graduate students to work on projects on nanoscale magnetism (2) Three workshops on different topics on nanoscale magnetism, such as nanomagnetic logic and atomic origin of magnetism were conducted through Richmond Math Science Innovation Center (MSIC); (3) A workshop demonstration on logic gates was developed using commercially available Snap Circuit sets and an analogy made to nanomagnetic logic gates. This workshop was conducted for a few high/middle school teachers. One of the teachers thus trained was identified and provided with the kits along with a detailed demonstration video uploaded on YouTube to conduct the workshop for high/middle school students and the impact of this workshop assessed in a survey.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/17/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jayasimha&nbsp;Atulasimha</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253370/1253370_10230929_1605594872351_Fig_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253370/1253370_10230929_1605594872351_Fig_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253370/1253370_10230929_1605594872351_Fig_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental creation and annihilation of  magnetic skyrmions with an electric field for energy efficient computing applications.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dhritiman Bhattacharya, Seyed Armin Razavi, Hao Wu, Bingqian Dai, Kang L.
