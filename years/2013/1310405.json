Feeding of the black hole will be assessed by measuring the kinematics of the masers from scales of tens of parsecs down to tenths of parsecs.  Dr. Greene will compare the stellar and gaseous kinematics on 20 parsec scales from adaptive-optics plus integral-field spectroscopy, to the orientation of the megamaser disk on sub-parsec scales, to learn how the gas accretes onto the disk.  She will determine whether secular (long-term) evolution leads to tight correlations between black hole mass and galaxy properties, including bulge kinematics, galaxy mass, and dark halo mass.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, outreach via public lectures, and teaching math to inmates through the Prison Teaching Initiative.",
