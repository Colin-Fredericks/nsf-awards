 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abundant rainfall is one of the reasons that tropical forests are so diverse and productive.  Climate change is predicted to shift the length and intensity of the dry seasons that most tropical forests experience. Understanding how these forests will respond to climate change therefore requires that we investigate the responses of tropical trees to drought. From temperate forests, we know that drought responses vary, not only among tree species, but also within species: populations of the same species from different sites can show different responses to drought, increasing the capacity of the species as a whole to persist when climate changes. However, we know very little how drought responses may vary within tropical tree species.  This project will measure the variation in response to drought within tropical tree species in Panama, where current rainfall varies from site to site across the isthmus from the Pacific to the Atlantic.  To contrast responses of trees in populations from sites with different amounts of rainfall, researchers will combine physiological measurements and genetic analyses with field experiments on the growth and survival of seedlings transplanted between sites.  Results will show whether variation is determined by genetic or environmental factors, and which plant traits underlie drought response. This will improve our ability to predict how tropical forests will respond to global climate change. \r\n\r\nThis project is important to society because tropical forests harbor the majority of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity and provide people with valuable products and ecosystem services. The information generated by the project will be useful for conserving biodiversity and for managing forests to maintain production of commercially important timber species.  Besides making findings available to the scientific community, the project will disseminate findings to local managers and stakeholders in a symposium.  In addition, the project will strengthen the workforce for science by training young biologists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The tropical forests that border the Panama Canal region have an incredibly high number of tree species in a remarkably small area. Tropical biologists think that over 1500 tree species live in these forests, a number equivalent to all the tree species found in temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere.  One reason for this high diversity is that forests in the region receive different amounts of rainfall each year, with the amount of rainfall doubling from the dry Pacific side forests to the wet Caribbean side forests in less than 50 miles.   Despite this high diversity overall, tree species are not distributed evenly across these forests.  Past studies across this rainfall gradient have shown that different tree species have different moisture requirements, with some tree species preferring wet areas, some preferring dry areas, and some species distributed across the entire area in both wet and dry forests.  As a result of these preferences, wet forests near the Caribbean tend to have more tree species than do the dry forests on the Pacific side.  These habitat requirements may have important implications for how forests will respond to changing climate in the coming decades.  Rainfall patterns in the tropics in the future are predicted to be different than they are today due to climate change and an overall drying trend is expected in some areas.  The ability of tree species to respond and adapt to these environmental changes is due, in part, to the amount of genetic diversity that is contained within and among their populations.   \n\nIn this four-year project, we measured the amount of genetic diversity found in 14 different tree species that are distributed across wet and dry forests of the region.
