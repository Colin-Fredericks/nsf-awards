 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this work is that it measures high-energy neutrino production in the universe and tests the standard model of particle physics thus increasing our fundamental knowledge of the high-energy universe. The origin of the highest energy cosmic-rays is one of the most compelling mysteries in modern physics. Air shower detectors have observed events with energies up to 3x10^20 electron volt (eV). However, despite decades of work, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanisms remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. Observation of astrophysical neutrinos will tell us that hadrons must be accelerated in these sources; the neutrino flux and spectrum will significantly constrain theoretical models.  \r\n\r\nThis award will support a search for the diffuse flux of neutrinos produced in these cosmic accelerators, using data from the recently completed IceCube detector. The work will be in two areas. The first is to search for a diffuse flux of electron and tau neutrinos. The group has demonstrated the power of using the outer strings and the top and bottom of IceCube to veto entering muon tracks by using it to measure the atmospheric electron neutrino flux from 50 gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 10 teraelectronvolt (TeV). They will extend this technique to neutrinos with energies from 10 TeV up to ~ 1 petaelectronvolt (PeV). They will also search for a diffuse flux of high-energy tau neutrinos, through their distinctive topology - two separated cascades. Second, they will use these neutrinos to make a measurement of the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at an energy around 50 TeV - by measuring neutrino absorption in the Earth. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The observation of extra-terrestrial neutrinos will have broad significance for astrophysics. The observation of hadronic accelerators in the universe would answer one of the 11 questions posed in the National Research Council study on the Physics of the Universe: \"Where do ultra-high energy particles come from\" The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures.",

These analyses used IceCube data to study the properties of energetic neutrinos, probing energies well above those that are accessible at accelerators.  We also made a measurement of the neutrino flavor ratio for astrophysical neutrinos.  This ratio is sensitive to the mechanism whereby the neutrinos were produced, and can give us hints about the sources of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration in the universe.\n\nOne analysis used IceCube data to observe, for the first time, neutrino absorption in the Earth, and, from that, to measure the cross-sections for neutrinos to interact with nucleons (protons and neutrons).  The analysis is sensitive to neutrino interactions at energies far above those that are accessible at man-made accelerators.

The flavor ratio is sensitive to the neutrino production mechanism, and so may hold clues as to the acceleration mechanism for ultra-energetic cosmic-rays.   For example, if the neutrinos are produced in a pion beam, where the muons can decay freely, the flavor ratio will be &nu;&tau;:&nu;&mu;:&nu;e = 0:2:1 &ndash; twice as many muon neutrinos as electron neutrinos (irrespective of whether they are neutrinos or antineutrinos), while if the neutrinos come from neutron decay, only electron-neutrinos are produced.  Unfortunately, the neutrinos travel a long distance before reaching Earth and their in-transit flavor-oscillations muddy the differences between the different initial compositions.    Figure 3 shows the measured flavor ratio, in the form of a flavor triangle, with proximity to the bottom left giving the fraction of electron neutrinos, the bottom right indicating the tau neutrino content, and the top giving the muon neutrino fraction.    For comparison, four different models are shown, after accounting for oscillation.  The current data was not adequate to eliminate the standard model expectations, but it was enough to rule out pure electron-neutrino, or pure muon-neutrino, as predicted in some beyond-standard-model calculations.  This analysis also tested neutrino oscillations in the very-high energy, very-long distance regime, something that has not been previously probed.\n\nA third, on-going analysis is a measurement of neutrino inelasticity.  This is a fundamental property of neutrino interactions, the fraction of the neutrinos energy that is transferred to a hadronic target, with the remainder transferred into a charged lepton.  Our analysis used muon neutrinos that transitioned into a charged muon.  It uses muon neutrinos with energies well above 1 TeV, far above the reach of terrestrial accelerators.  Figure 4 shows a histogram of the preliminary inelasticity distribution, fit to a cocktail containing its expected constituents.  The cocktail includes contributions from astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos, and a tau-neutrino component that leaks in to the muon-neutrino event selection.    The agreement between the data and the cocktail is good, indicating that no new physics is present.  Additional fits will be sensitive to some specific aspects of neutrino interactions, including the production of charmed quarks.  For this analysis, we developed new machine-learning tools to measure the neutrino energy in contained events, incorporating both the hadronic cascade and the outgoing muon.\n\nIn addition, the group contributed to IceCube simulations, and collaboration-wide analysis and calibrations software.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Spencer Klein"
