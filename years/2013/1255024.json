Proposed is a creative effort based on the concept of modular, interdisciplinary, components of science.  On the education side, this project will provide the general public, local schools, and NMSU students (4-6 graduate and 10 undergraduate, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities) with opportunities, methods, and tools for learning about the Sun.  It therefore helps increase diversity in STEM education, public awareness, and research.  On the science side, this project will identify the key components of complexity and dynamics of coronal heating and solar flares through student research projects.  The integration of education and research lies in identifying, creating, and using modular, interdisciplinary tools.   The proposed research and EPO agenda supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.",
