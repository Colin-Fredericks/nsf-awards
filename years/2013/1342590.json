 "awd_abstract_narration": "The First Workshop on Modeling of Biological Systems (MoBS) focuses on computational methods and software tools for modeling and analysis of biological systems. It will bring together researchers from computational systems biology and design automation communities. The goal of MoBS is to create an environment where different types of researchers interact and start fruitful collaborations. Co-locating MoBS with Design Automation Conference (DAC) provides means to fulfill this goal. For biologists, this workshop is an opportunity to showcase their work to an entirely new audience and gain exposure to a new talent pool of potential postdocs and graduate students. For electronic design automation (EDA) experts, this workshop provides an excellent opportunity to explore challenges in biology and medical research, and recognize potential for new collaborations and novel applications of methods and techniques they are familiar with.  Existing systems biology conferences and meetings do not actively include the EDA community, which can bring a wide range of experiences, expertise, and perspectives to the modeling and analysis of novel biological systems. MoBS allow the EDA community to interact with and learn from leaders in systems biology. A number of academic leaders in systems biology are featured speakers of MoBS.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will provide a venue for fifteen technical talks, among them four keynote talks, five invited lectures, and six contributed talks, as well as ten to fifteen posters. Topics of the workshop are diverse and include areas such as:  biological network inference, CAD and visualization of biological systems, data-mining for bio and health-care systems, hybrid methods for bio-system simulation, bio-model validation and verification, sensitivity analysis for biological systems and much more. A wide variety of researchers from EDA and computational systems biology are brought together in a unique context, which is not provided at other conferences. The slides, posters, and abstracts from the workshop will be made public on the workshop website. Finally, MoBS will have numerous undergraduate, graduate and post graduate student researchers in attendance. The organizing committee encourages and supports woman and underrepresented minority student participation, and has planned a diverse technical program.",
