 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central challenge facing contemporary biology is to understand how organisms adapt to changing environments. This research focuses on whether predictions of microevolutionary shifts in the physiology of animal populations can be based on ecosystem-level information. Answers to such questions should foster better forecasting models of global environmental change and inform effective management. Using a unique model organism, Daphnia, a small crustacean that lives in lakes and produces resting eggs that can lay dormant in sediments for centuries, the Principal Investigators (PIs) have been able to directly observe the evolutionary consequences of man-made change in a natural population. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the PIs will elucidate the precise mechanisms that underlie observed evolutionary shifts coinciding with changes in key environmental parameters such as phosphorus (P) loading history (i.e., nutrient enrichment that affects water quality). Specifically, they will use cutting-edge paleolimnological tools to examine lake-bottom sediments to precisely reconstruct erstwhile environments reflective of pre- and post-European settlement, and use that information to test the performance of ancient and extant Daphnia genotypes to assess anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, they will couple experimental evolution, and high throughput genomics methods to identify the genes that underlie such evolutionary shifts. The performance of these genes in predicting responses to nutrient enrichment (i.e., eutrophication) in a different lake will also be assessed. \r\n\r\nThe PIs will continue to recruit students from underrepresented groups at various levels (high-school, undergraduate, and graduate). This project will train a postdoctoral fellow, three graduate research students, a museum intern, three undergraduate research assistants, and a high school intern. The genomic information generated from the proposed experiments will be made available to the scientific community via www.wFleabase.org as soon as possible, while the Daphnia clone bank generated during this project will be shared after the duration of the grant. Moreover, results from this study are relevant to issues of water quality and environmental change (particularly from paleolimnological assays), and the PIs will continue to share data with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for outreach to lake managers and the general public. In partnership with the Science Museum of Minnesota, the project will be part of the NSF-sponsored award-winning www.sciencebuzz.org online exhibits that blend up-to-the-minute science news (via RSS technology) with traditional museum interactive experiences, reaching potentially 500,000-800,000 individuals per year. The PIs will provide content on global environmental change, particularly related to lakes, and the ability of aquatic organisms to adapt to changing conditions. Finally, this work contributes to and benefits from federally-funded resources such as the Daphnia Genomics Consortium and the National Lacustrine Core Facility.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPublic Outcomes Report\n\nCollaborative Research:  Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)\n\nA millennial-scale chronicle of organism-environment interactions resulting in microevolutionary physiological and genomic shifts in Daphnia \n\nCo-Principal Investigators:     \n\nDr. Punidan D. Jeyasingh, Dept. of Zoology, Oklahoma State. U.\n\nDr. Lawrence J. Weider, Dept. of Biology, U. of Oklahoma\n\nDr. Mark B. Edlund, Science Museum of Minnesota\n\nAs part of our NSF-funded research, we want to gain a better understanding of how organisms adapt to changing environments.  Therefore, we study the small freshwater organism called Daphnia (common name is water flea &ndash; but it is not a real flea &ndash; they are more \"shrimp-like\").  Daphnia are key species living in ponds and lakes around the world, and they play an important role because they feed on algae (small aquatic plants) resulting in improved water quality/clarity.  In turn, many fish species eat Daphnia, so they play an important central role in aquatic \"food webs\".  Historically, different Daphnia species have been used in laboratories around the world to test for water quality (i.e. chemical pollutants) because these \"critters\" are very sensitive (like a \"canary-in-a-coal-mine\") to toxic chemicals.  So, they play an important role in making sure that drinking water is safe for human consumption.\n\nAnother important feature of Daphnia is that it is primarily asexual &ndash; that is, mothers produce genetically identical (clonal) daughters.  This allows for easier culturing and use in the laboratory for all types of experiments, because you can culture large numbers of genetically identical individuals from a single individual.  However, Daphnia also has a sexual phase, where they produce both sons and daughters.  When mating occurs, the result is the production of dormant (resting) eggs in a protective casing (ephippium) that can sink and become buried in the mud in the bottom of ponds and lakes.  Think of peas (eggs) in a pea pod (ephippium).  This dormant \"egg bank\" builds up over decades and centuries (even thousands of years).  We can \"travel back in time\" by taking mud/sediment cores from the lake/pond bottom, slicing the cores into hockey-puck-sized sections (that are time-dated using special methods), sifting out the eggs from the mud (almost like prospecting for gold), and then hatching the eggs in the laboratory, and establishing individual Daphnia clones from each egg.\n\nWith our NSF-funded research, we have been looking at lakes in Minnesota that have been experiencing different levels of nutrient (i.e., phosphorus) pollution through time. Note: phosphorus is a critical nutrient that is used world-wide in fertilizers for both agricultural and home-owner use.  When too much phosphorus washes into lakes and ponds, it can cause algal blooms &ndash; i.e. \"pond scum\" &ndash; which impact water quality for human consumption as well as recreational use, and can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. \n\nIn these Minnesota lakes, we have successfully hatched out Daphnia eggs that are decades to even centuries-old (perhaps as old as ~600-700 years).  This means that, to date, these ancient hatched Daphnia clones are among the oldest (if not THE oldest) animals brought back to life from a dormant life stage.  We have been looking at how these Daphnia clones from different time periods over hundreds of years (i.e. before and after European settlers came to Minnesota) respond to changing environmental conditions such as phosphorus pollution.  Our results indicate that these clones show distinct differences in how they respond genetically and physiologically to changes in their nutrient environment.  This provides critical information for trying to understand how other species can adapt to environmental changes.  Further work will continue to examine how using an organism like Daphnia can help us better track environmental changes and protect water quality for future generations.  We have developed novel genomic tools, and trained several students in ecological genomics. These individuals are well versed in cutting-edge molecular techniques and analytical methods and are invaluable assets of the American workforce. Our results should prove useful in assisting lake managers, natural resource stakeholders and private land owners in protecting our freshwater ecosystems - one of our most precious resources!\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark B Edlund"
