The theme of the 2013 event is the mathematical legacy of William B. Arveson (1934-2011), who was a pioneer in the operator theory/operator algebra field.  Among the main topics to be discussed by speakers at the meeting are the following: non-self-adjoint operator algebras; complete positivity, complete boundedness, and quantum information; actions by groups of automorphisms of operator algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
