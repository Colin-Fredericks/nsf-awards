 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of three scientists from Kansas State University, Michigan State University and the Desert Botanical Garden will investigate polyploidy (the condition of having more than one set of chromosomes) and diversity in the plant genus Phlox (Polemoniaceae). The Phlox species P. amabilis, P. nana and P. woodhousei all exhibit variation in ploidy level and occur as diploid (two sets of chromosomes, 2X), tetraploid (4X) and hexaploid (6X) populations in the southwestern United States. Geographic patterns of ploidy level variation will be documented for these groups using flow cytometry and chromosome count data. By combining phylogenetic, population genetic, morphological, and ecological analyses the researchers will infer relationships among populations, reconstruct their origins, estimate patterns of gene flow, investigate the affect of polyploidy on phenotypes, and identify whether particular ploidy types are more commonly associated with different ecological niches. Data from these approaches will also be used to revise the taxonomy of the group.\r\n\r\nWhile polyploidy is considered to play an important role in plant evolution, our current knowledge of ploidy level variation relative to diversity is limited. This project investigates questions of general interest on polyploidy and diversity and integrates findings to advance a broader understanding of the role of polyploidy in the diversification of plants. Educational modules relating incorporating this research will be developed for public school and botanical garden audiences, and participants from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level will benefit from training and collaboration.",

Polyploidy, the condition of having extra sets of chromosomes in cells, is a common phenomenon in plants and is considered to play an important role in plant evolution. Understanding the role and impacts of polyploidy in natural plant populations gives us insight into how polyploidy affects diversity in nature. This research focused on several species of the plant genus <em>Phlox </em>distributed in the southwestern United States. We applied multiple lines of evidence to improve our understanding of the effects of polyploidy on aspects of diversity, including studies of plant distributions, plant shapes and sizes, genetic relationships among individual plants, populations and species, and ecology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Accomplishments from our collaborative research include:</p>\n<p><strong>Numerous plant collections, DNA and tissue samples, and data sets enabling current and future research.</strong><em> </em>Scientific products include collections of plants documenting new and historic population locations, which are deposited in three herbaria for use by the scientific community; leaf, flower, and pollen samples; hundreds of DNA extractions; and data sets detailing chromosome number, physical measurements of plants, DNA sequences, DNA variation at fine-scales, and environmental features across numerous individuals and populations of these species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>A better understanding of the role of polyploidy in natural systems</strong>. We learned that polyploidy is surprisingly common in all three species, with about half or more of all populations we sampled consisting of polyploid plants. Polyploidy found in these populations is associated with substantial diversity across all three species, reflected in the distribution of populations, plant shape (for example, leaves, flowers, and pollen), genetic relationships, population genetic variation, and environmental and ecological features. However, the effects of polyploidy are not necessarily predictable across populations with different ploidies or across species.

Our research team worked collaboratively with public school teachers to develop and implement an educational module on polyploidy and diversity at the high school level. We also held workshops at the Desert Botanical Garden demonstrating to the education staff and docents how our work relates to biodiversity in the southwestern U.S. This, in turn, led to informal science education opportunities for a broad audience of garden visitors.
