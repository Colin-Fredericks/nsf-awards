The SEM will have an impact on research and education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The institution recently launched several initiatives to upgrade its research programs at both the masters and PhD level, and the undergraduate level. The SEM will be integrated in current courses in the Colleges of Aviation, Engineering, and Arts and Sciences, and support new research areas at the undergraduate and graduate levels both on and off campus. It will also help attract and retain new research-oriented faculty to help develop the new PhD programs in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Physics. The SEM will also be used in an existing outreach program to bring high-school teachers to visit the University during summers and conduct research projects with professors.

In December 2013, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University took delivery of an FEI Quanta 650 SEM with a Bruker Quantax 100 EDX. Remote operation capability was implemented for use across campus as well as from the outside. The SEM was first installed in March 2014 and full capability was reached in September 2014. This instrument added a basic capability to the University, allowing faculty and students to conduct fundamental materials science research.
