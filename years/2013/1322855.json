 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks financial support to build a national model for introducing and educating blind youth via informal venues such as museums and science centers. This will encompass  STEM subjects writ large. Further, parents of blind children, teachers, and ISE venue personnel will be incorporated into the educational process enhancing the holistic approach. Additionally, there is an element of efficacy development in this endeavor for the students.\r\n\r\nStudents in grades 3-6 and high school students are the main target audiences. The former are targeted as this is the time when they often succumb to the challenges and fade away from an interest in STEM. The high school students will have a dual role in that they will be tutors for the younger group and will take special education courses to prepare them for postsecondary education in STEM topics. Six venues spanning the nation have been chosen to provide a broad spectrum of perspective and broadening impacts for the project.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will yield an education model for similar endeavors in other parts of the country. It will provide guidance for ISE venues not yet prepared to accommodate blind people and youth. It will give new perspective to parents and teachers on how to provide education in STEM subjects to blind students. The team of this endeavor includes the PI, who is blind, from the National Federation of the Blind; the co-PI from the Museum of Science in Boston; Leigh Abts from the University of Maryland; Jeff Killebrew from the New Mexico School for the Blind; Laura Bostick former NASA engineer; Hoby Wedler, Ph.D. candidate in chemistry; Richie Flores, Mentor for the students; Eric Guillary, Mentorfor the students; Tiffany Wild from Ohio State University is the research lead; and Joe Heimlich will do the project evaluation.",

The program partnered with six museums across the country: Museum of Science, Boston; Port Discovery Children&rsquo;s Museum, Baltimore; COSI, Columbus; Arizona Science Center, Phoenix; Exploratorium, San Francisco; and Science Museum of Minnesota, St. Paul. The project demonstrated how a national disability nonprofit could utilize its network of volunteers, providing the real-life expertise of blind people in intimate, one-on-one partnerships with museums in order to improve experiences for blind and other nonvisual learners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NCBYS project consisted of two-day programs (NFB STEM2U) at each of the aforementioned museums, and included blind elementary and high school students, the latter serving as mentors to the former. Parents accompanied the blind elementary students and participated in parent workshops related to nonvisual adaptations to common STEM activities. Throughout, NFB personnel worked with science center staff to improve their ability to address the needs of the blind learner, both in infrastructure and in personnel training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project also consisted of separate, week-long programs (NFB EQ) for blind high school students featuring more advanced STEM concepts such as engineering design. It introduced students to adaptive techniques and tools such as the talking tape measure, click rulers, talking salinity meters, and tactile drawing materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NCBYS project utilized <a href=\"http://www.blindscience.org/\">www.blindscience.org</a> as the primary location for hosting project information, with links to other relevant sites including YouTube videos documenting program activities. Evaluation reports compiled by Lifelong Learning Group have been posted to <a href=\"http://www.informalscience.org/\">www.informalscience.org</a>. An article entitled &ldquo;Accommodating Blind Learners Helps All Learners&rdquo; was published in the <em>Journal of Museum Education</em> in its March 2016 issue. Authored by the project director, Natalie Shaheen, and the project evaluators, Joe Heimlich and Mary Ann Wojton of Lifelong Learning Group, the article details best practices to enhance the experiences of blind learners and how these methods can help informal science educators enhance educational experiences for all learners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the program evaluation, the project can report that:</p>\n<p>1. Parent participants learned alternative techniques that facilitate their blind children&rsquo;s participation in K-12 STEM subjects, and, as a broader impact, how they can connect with the NFB over the long term to assist in life-skill development and post-secondary educational pursuits in STEM.</p>\n<p>2. Apprentice participants&mdash;high school-aged youth who participated alongside elementary students during regional programs&mdash;successfully mentored their younger counterparts during STEM instruction.</p>\n<p>3. Participation increased the confidence level of museum staff regarding their interactions with blind visitors. Museum personnel noted the importance of using descriptive language with a blind visitor, the development of tactile maps for the museum, and stronger relationships with disability organizations in their communities. Each museum has made and is continuing to make improvements that will make their institution more impactful to blind learners. Partner museums have since held Google Hangouts and other informal dissemination opportunities to share their experiences with other institutions.</p>\n<ol> </ol><ol> </ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NCBYS project facilitated connections between science centers and other disability organizations, including area schools for the blind. For example, the San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind has been connected with the Exploratorium and has engaged in regular field trips to the science center, collaborations on a tactile science center map, and ongoing plans for future activities. Collaborations between the local state affiliate of the NFB ensure that work on nonvisual enhancements to exhibits and volunteer trainings will continue beyond the project period. The NFB has been asked to participate on advisory boards for future exhibit construction at participating museums.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result of the project, Port Discovery and COSI are two of only a handful of currently known museums in the country to implement nonvisual indoor navigation technology. This technology remains in the testing and evaluation phase, but has the potential to improve the museum experience for blind and sighted visitors alike. Based on this work, a collaboration has begun between the NFB and Towson University in Maryland to implement a wayfinding system on their campus, as well as the production of tactile campus maps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connections made have impacted other informal education, including the 2017 NFB Youth Slam, a week-long STEM program hosted by Towson University. Staff from the Science Museum of Minnesota, as well as professors from Utah State University developed and implemented curricula during the program using lessons learned during the NCBYS project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Work performed under the NCBYS project led NFB staff and its partners to pursue a new NSF-AISL grant to focus on the spatial ability of blind youth and how that ability can be impacted by nonvisually accessible engineering instruction. This new grant, now underway, is a direct result of observations from the NCBYS project wherein students&rsquo; exposure to accessible technical drafting improved their understanding of spatial concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;A&nbsp;Riccobono</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
