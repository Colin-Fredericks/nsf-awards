 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research that addresses issues relating to quantum effects in both cosmological and black hole spacetimes.  These are questions related to the validity of the semi-classical approximation when it is used to describe the effects of quantized fields on a classical background field and to determine whether observable effects related to the existence of a horizon, in this case a sonic horizon, can be found in certain  Bose-Einstein condensates, which can serve as black hole analogues.  One project involves determining whether quantum fluctuations in the density and pressure of matter and radiation will be large during a period of inflation when the universe is expanding exponentially. If so, then the semi-classical approximation to gravity breaks down and a different method will be needed to describe what happens.  A second project investigates the validity of the semiclassical approximation when the universe contracts for one important model in which the contraction is to a minimal size and is followed by an expansion.  Evidence suggesting a quantum instability in this model could indicate that quantum fluctuations become large during the contraction phase.   A third project investigates whether quantum effects that could be observed in laboratory studies and which are related to the existence of a horizon exist for a model in which a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as an analog for a black hole.  Specifically the density density correlation function is computed in order to determine whether undulations are predicted to occur and whether other new observable effects that require the existence of a horizon can be found.\r\n\r\nCompletion of these projects will elucidate phenomena ranging from the expansion of the universe to potentially observable effects in black hole analogues.  If quantum fluctuations prove to be large in important situations, then predictions made using the semi-classical approximation will be suspect, and a different method must be found to treat the effects of the quantized fields.  The work on the validity of the semiclassical approximation could have implications for and be extended to other situations in which this approximation has been used such as the production of particles in the presence of a strong electric field and the modeling of heavy ion collisions in nuclear physics.  The work on Bose-Einstein condensates which serve as analog black holes may predict specific effects that experimental condensed matter physicists can attempt to observe in laboratory experiments.  If observed, these effects would provide significant evidence that predictions of quantum effects relating to black holes, such as black hole evaporation, are correct.  It is expected that at least three undergraduate students and at least one graduate student will participate in many aspects of the research, continuing a long history of the training of students in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications. Results will be disseminated to the research community through publications and presentations at national and international meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research done for this grant addresses quantum effects in a variety of circumstances including cosmology, black holes, and Bose-Einstein condensates that can serve as analogs for black holes.  These effects include particle production and vacuum polarization.  The latter results in contributions to the energy density and pressure which can be nonzero even when no matter or radiation is present.\n\nDe Sitter space is a very important cosmological model which in a particular set of coordinates corresponds to a universe that begins with infinite size, contracts to a finite minimum size and then expands to an infinite size.  The expanding phase is often used as a model for the universe during inflation when the universe expands extremely rapidly for a short period or for the late time behavior of the universe.  So far there have been three publications focused on quantum effects in de Sitter space.  The most important result is that evidence was found for a quantum instability of de Sitter space during the contracting phase.  This means that quantum effects can have such a significant influence on the contraction that the resulting spacetime would not even behave approximately like de Sitter space does at later times.\n\nAnother focus in cosmology has been the validity of an approximation called the semiclassical approximation which is used to describe the rapid particle production that occurs right after the universe expands very rapidly in models of chaotic inflation (a certain mechanism that has been proposed for inflation).  The key result is that the semiclassical approximation is not valid during this rapid phase of particle production and other ways must be found to obtain a detailed description of an important aspect of this process.  A paper has been submitted for publication.\n\nA third focus in cosmology has been a study of whether quantum effects can remove final singularities in which quantities such as the density of the dark energy diverge.  As in certain previous studies, evidence was found that in some cases the singularities could be removed by quantum effects and in other cases this is not predicted to occur.\n\nWork on quantum effects in black hole spacetimes and for Bose-Einstein condensate analog black holes has so far resulted in two publications.  Initially evidence was found that quantum effects at low energies might cause a divergence in the energy density of a massless quantum field outside a black hole immersed in de Sitter space.  Evidence was also found that there might be a divergence in an observable quantity called the density-density correlation function for a certain class of Bose-Einstein condensate analog black holes.  A detailed analysis showed that in fact these divergences do not occur.\n\nWork was done on the details of particle production which occurs when a black hole forms in a simple model in which it forms from a spherical shell that collapses at the speed of light.  A correspondence has been found between the particle production that occurs when the black hole forms in a particular way and the particle production that occurs when a mirror accelerates along a particular trajectory in two dimensions.  The time dependence of the particle production process in these cases and its approach to a thermal distribution has also been investigated.  So far two papers have been written that will be submitted to the proceedings of an international conference that was held in July of 2015.\n\nIt is interesting to study quantum effects in Bose-Einstein condensate black holes because there is the possibility that an experiment could be devised to test them.  It is virtually impossible to measure quantum effects in black holes that form from stars or are at the centers of galaxies because they are too small.  Previous work indicated that it was possible for undulations (stationary standing waves) to occur for a certain class of Bose-Einstein condensate analog black holes.  Evidence has been found that such u..."
