 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Deborah Ann Sunter of University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Shanghai University of Electric Power in Shanghai, China.  The project title is \"Evaluating Concentrating Solar Thermal Power as a Renewable Energy Alternative for China.\" The host scientist is Dean Jianxing Ren. \r\n\r\nConcentrating solar thermal power is an environmentally friendly technology that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in China and on a global scale by providing a model for meeting growing energy needs in a sustainable manned. This research project develops a computational model to identify economically promising locations for large-scale solar thermal power plants. These sites are compared to conventional coal power generation with a multi-objective optimization program to minimize the cost of power generation, storage and transmission. There are potentially transformative aspects of the proposed work that could alter the energy portfolio of China. Changes in China's energy portfolio have the potential for benefits for China and beyond, including inspiring similar changes in other countries.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, participation at Clean Energy Expo China enhances the Fellow's perspective on the current international research efforts in the area of renewable energy.",
