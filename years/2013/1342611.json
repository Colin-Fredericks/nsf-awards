 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the third CETUP* program that is planned to take place on June 24 - July 26, 2013 in Lead/Deadwood, SD. The main goal of CETUP* is to bring together people with different talents and skills to address the most exciting questions in particle and nuclear physics, astrophysics, geosciences, and geomicrobiology. Scientists invited to participate in the program do not only provide theoretical support to the underground science, they also examine underlying universal questions of the 21st century including: What is dark matter?, What are the masses of neutrinos?, How have neutrinos shaped the evolution of the universe?, How were the elements from iron to uranium made?, and What is the origin and thermal history of the Earth?\r\n\r\nThis summer CETUP* will organize a 5-week long program covering various aspects of theoretical and experimental underground science. A two week long session focused on Dark Matter will be followed by a two week long program on Neutrino Physics. The VIIth International Conference on Interconnections between Particle Physics and Cosmology will be sandwiched between these sessions covering the subjects of dark matter, neutrino physics, collider physics, and cosmological and astrophysical issues with connections to particle physics from both theoretical end experimental viewpoints.\r\n\r\nAmong the Broader Impacts, the program will offer a stimulating environment for research collaborations between scientists of varying ages and nationalities and training of young scientists including undergraduate and graduate students and underrepresented groups. Outreach efforts will aim to share the excitement of the research with K-12 students and the general public. A \"Neutrino Day\" is planned through the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory at the end of the CETUP* program. During the CETUP* 2012 program they established a collaboration with the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation and Indian University of North America. They plan to continue working with them during the CETUP* 2013 program to reach out to Native American students and include them in the educational activities at the CETUP* as well as organize an informal get together with the students and discuss their interests in science and possible future STEM career opportunities.",
