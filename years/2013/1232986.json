 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particles play essential roles in the cycling and distribution of trace elements and isotopes (TEI). For instance scavenging onto particles and removal by particle export is a major sink for many TEIs. However the driving factors affecting the spatial extent and temporal variability of TEI scavenging remain largely unknown. The U.S. GEOTRACES East Pacific Zonal Transect between Peru and Tahiti will cross three biogeochemically important areas, setting the stage for researchers to constrain unknowns surrounding particle scavenging. \r\n\r\nScientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will address fundamental questions on the location of particle formation, particle-dissolved species interactions, dominant particle phases, and the evolution of particle phases during transport. As regards particle phases, the researchers will measure particulate organic carbon (POC), calcium carbonate, opal, lithogenics, and oxyhydroxides, as well as the trace element compositions of size fractionated particles covering three distinct zones: large lateral productivity gradients, a major oxygen deficient zone off the coast of Peru, and a world renowned hydrothermal plume emanating from the southern East Pacific Rise. Furthermore, since previous results suggest particle type affects scavenging, investigators will specifically measure acid-leachable trace metals, particle concentration, and major particle composition. These combined measurements will allow them to disentangle the relative importance of hydrothermal particles, benthic nepheloid layers, and high productivity margins for scavenging of TEIs. The cruise transect will also offer unique opportunities to examine the speciation of Fe and POC in hydrothermal particles away from the vent field and the effects of aggregation and POC coatings on TEI partitioning. \r\n\r\nAs regards broader impacts, the researchers plan to create an educational module on particulate trace metals in the ocean which would become part of a five part GEOTRACES webinar series developed by Dr. Benjamin Twining at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in collaboration with the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence-Ocean Systems at the University of Maine.  One graduate student from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and one graduate student from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, would be supported and trained as part of this project.  In addition, an undergraduate student would participate in the research during the summer month as part of the Woods Hole Diversity Initiative Partnership in Education program.",

This hypothesis was based on recent observations at the northern East Pacific Rise (e.g. 9oN), as well as historical plume studies indicating abundant sulfur along the southern East Pacific Rise (15oS) segment of the mid-ocean ridge. In contrast to our hypothesis, the 15oS plume and underlying sediments were depleted in both particulate sulfur and chemically reduced iron. Essentially all iron detected was in the form of an oxidized and poorly soluble for (i.e. iron(III)).  Although sulfur and sulfur-bearing minerals (such as pyrite, FeS2) were undetectable in all of our plume particles (greater than 0.2 micrometer in diameter), particulate carbon was prevalent in all samples examined.  Within the plume, the particulate carbon was exclusively in organic forms (at all stations) and was either spatially correlated with iron at the nanometer scale (near the mid-ocean ridge) or found as coatings on iron-bearing mineral particles (far from the mid-ocean ridge).  Our data interpretation is on-going, but it appears that organic carbon and iron travel together within and on plume particles for 1000s of kilometers away from the mid-ocean ridge.  This finding overturns major assumptions made by scientists for decades about the mobility of iron in the ocean.  It is an exciting discovery that changes our understanding of the role of hydrothermally dervied iron in the global ocean iron budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brandy M Toner"
