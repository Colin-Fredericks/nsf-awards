 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NJIT EXTREEMS program builds upon the established record of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in interdisciplinary research involving the computational analysis of data and the modeling and simulation of complex systems. The program will immerse undergraduates in courses and group projects relating to mathematical computation and data analysis, and promote faculty professional development through participation in workshops on computational science education.   Students will be exposed to computational issues in multidisciplinary situations, including in industrial settings. The program includes the development of new courses and enhancements of existing ones that will permanently enrich the Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) curriculum at NJIT. Some of the enhancements are in courses that are taken by students in a wide variety of majors, and the changes will impact their careers in science and technology.  The group research projects will use and develop fast and accurate algorithms to study problems in medicine, fluid dynamics, acoustics, climate modelling, and risk assessment. Many of the projects will lead to improvements in computational techniques for data analysis such as dimension reduction, data assimilation, and Monte Carlo methods. Valuable information will be gained and disseminated on effective ways to educate students in these computational techniques.\r\n\r\nComputational tools are increasingly important in a broad number of areas in science and technology.  For example, computer algorithms are used to predict the spread of an oil spill, investigate the properties of DNA, process and sharpen radar images, and assess the risks of investment portfolios and nuclear power plants.  In many fields, extremely large data sets are being collected or generated, posing significant challenges to modeling, computer simulation, and data analysis.   This five year EXTREEMS program will significantly enhance the exposure of undergraduate mathematical science students at NJIT to topics in CDS&E. This exposure will come from the broad infusion of CDS&E topics into the curriculum and a rigorous interdisciplinary research program that will introduce students to computational tools for the analysis of large data sets and modeling and simulation of complex systems. An important component of our program is the group nature of the proposed activities, including team projects supervised by multiple faculty, and participation of industrial partners.  With expertise in scientific computation and data analysis and their honed leadership and communication skills, EXTREEMS students will emerge from this program with unique interdisciplinary skills and are expected to become future leaders in the mathematical sciences both in industry and in the nation's graduate programs.  This project is jointly supported by NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences and Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of computational techniques and data science methods has become ubiquitous in science, engineering, and finance, among other areas.  The EXTREEMS-QED program at NJIT has brought together teams consisting of people from industry and various disciplines in academia along with more than 40 undergraduates from NJIT's diverse student body in year long research projects.  These interdisciplinary investigations have resulted in enhanced understanding of problems in areas ranging from underwater acoustics to sports training.   The undergraduate participants in EXTREEMS-QED have not only gained knowledge of state of the art methodology in computational science and data science but also have emerged from the program with enhanced communication and leadership skills that have enabled them to thrive in industrial positions as well as in graduate school in a variety of disciplines (including, but certainly not limited to, the mathematical sciences.)  EXTREEMS-QED has also led to curriculum enhancements that have benefited the entire NJIT student body.  Courses widely taken by students across campus have been updated to include more topics relevant to data science and new courses have been created.  The degree program in statistics received a substantial update to reflect contemporary societal needs in data science.  A new degree program in data science (offered jointly with computer science) has been created that will help meet the continually growing industrial demand for data scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Horntrop"
