Laboratory and coastal field studies of MeHg interactions with different types of phytoplankton, interaction with specific organic compounds, effects of light and temperature are all expected to influence MeHg binding and or uptake into phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include: \r\n1) provision of  policy relevant information in support of monitoring and evaluation efforts for control of anthropogenic mercury releases; \r\n2) informing education on marine conservation and sustainability by developing a case study on mercury in the marine environment; and \r\n3) training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists",
