 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professors Frederick M. MacDonnell and Norma S. Tacconi of the University of Texas at Arlington to develop a class of molecular photocatalysts designed to drive the reduction of carbon dioxide all the way to methanol.  Energy derived from fossil fuels, while central to today's economy, is not a sustainable solution to global energy needs and has potentially severe environmental consequences upon continued use.  Liquid transportation fuels derived from fossil fuels are difficult to replace, however solar technologies that efficiently convert carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to liquid fuels (such as methanol), could directly address this problem.  This research team is using well-established ruthenium polypyridyl complexes as chromophores because of their stability, tunability, and favorable photophysical properties.  These molecules are coupled with pyridine-based catalysts to obtain a deep 6-electron reduction of the carbon dioxide to methanol.  Notably, despite all the advances with carbon dioxide electro- and photo-reduction with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, reduction has been limited to the two-electron reduction products (carbon monoxide or formic acid) with deeper reduction to methanol or methane conspicuously absent.  The well understood ruthenium chromophore is being used to provide proof-of-concept results that establish the reaction mechanism before chromophores based on organics dyes or more earth-abundant elements are utilized.  Photocatalytic activity is being studied in both aqueous (as a function of pH) and non-aqueous environments, in the presence and absence of metallic surfaces, and with various electrolytes and neutral modifiers to promote the desired reaction.  Photocatalyst function is screened and interrogated using custom designed photoreactors and their catalytic efficiency is optimized by determining quantum yield and catalytic turnover as a function of reaction conditions.  The technical implications of this research may help develop a carbon-neutral fuel cycle and produce a liquid fuel that requires minimal infrastructure changes to adopt.  This research falls under the \"SusChEM\" program as it utilizes non-petroleum based resources (i.e., carbon dioxide) to produce a liquid fuel (methanol).  The investigators are actively involved in K-12 education through a number of outreach programs, most notably through the development and implementation of an externally-funded \"Chemistry Magic Show\" run through the Science Ambassadors program in the College of Science. Over 43,400 students have seen the \"Chemistry Magic Show\" since its inception in 2008.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhotochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to potentially useful fuels was the central theme of this research project and during the 16-17 FY. We had some success in one aspect of the project and some serious setbacks with another goal.  \n\nWe succeeded in developing an organic visible-light chromophore which can be photoreduced by up to 4 electrons accompanied by stoichiometric protonation upon visible light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial reducing agent, such as trimethylamine.   This organic chromophore also contains four bidentate chelating sites and a corresponding tetrametallic ruthenium(II) complex of the ligand also prepared.  This complex was similarly photochemically active.   These results have been communicated in our 2017 Inorganica Chimica Acta paper.\n\nIn 2016, we published a paper in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS 2016, 113, 2579-2584 ) reporting on the production of C2+ hydrocarbon products, including a significant portion(&gt; 17% by mass) of C5+ products, upon UV irradiation of CO2 and steam at 200 C in a tubular flow reactor.  A catalyst comprised of cobalt on TiO2 anatase (P25) was reported to act as the chromophore (TiO2), water oxidation site (TiO2) and Fischer-Tropsch like reduction site (Co).  Unfortunately, we subsequently determined that the carbon in the hydrocarbon products did not originate from the CO2, but instead from graphitic impurities in the commercial grade P25 TiO2 catalyst.  This required the use of 100% 13-carbon labeled CO2 and revealed that only 5% or less of this carbon is incorporated into the products.  While this work shows that graphitic carbon can be mobilized and hydrogenated to form potentially useful hydrocarbons under such conditions, the importance of the findings are now lessened, as the reduction of CO2 is central to any carbon neutral fuel cycle.  This subsequent data required us to retract our 2016 PNAS paper which was done in early 2018 (PNAS 2018, 115 (3) E557)\n\nFinally, our synthetic work in the construction of new chromophores for photochemical CO2 photoreduction led to numerous ruthenium(II) compounds that could also be used in our project on the utility of such complexes as cytotoxic agents for potential anti-cancer therapy.  Our studies of these ruthenium polypyridyl complexes as potential medicinal agents resulted in two additional peer-reviewed publications (2017 Chemical Sciences, 8, 3736-3739; 2017 ChemMedChem,  12, 1055-1069)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick M Macdonnell"
