 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buyers and sellers negotiating in a market face a series of stages from partner choice to information gathering to haggling, etc., with the optimal decisions at each stage depending on both players' bargaining positions. These bargaining positions will depend on the players' assets (income and capital) and outside options for alternative buyers and sellers. Animals face similar decisions regarding courtship, including how much energy to acquire, who to court, how much information to gather, when to give up, etc. In the mating market, males and females haggle during courtship, with their bargaining positions determined by their assets (foraging success and body condition) as well as the number of alternative partners for each. Thus economic models of negotiation in a market provide a framework for viewing courtship as a process where males and females can use tactics to improve their negotiating outcome, using the resources they have available. This project explores this framework using greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as a model species. New technology will allow experimental study of courtship and detailed observation of foraging behaviors in the wild, with minimal disturbance. Methods include presentations of interactive female robots, next-generation GPS loggers and accelerometers to measure off-lek foraging behaviors, as well as bioanalytical assays of the nutrition and toxicity of sagebrush that grouse prefer to consume. We expect to show that success in courtship, as in business, requires income and capital as well as skilled negotiation. Sage-grouse are a candidate species for listing as endangered. The PIs will conduct multimedia presentations on sage-grouse ecology and conservation for the public, and develop course materials and presentations for primary schools, tribal colleges and universities in sage-grouse habitat. Research by PIs will continue to directly inform sage-grouse conservation efforts. In addition, the PIs will continue to provide research opportunities for students (>175 since 2006), including many from under-represented groups.",

Animals face similar decisions regarding courtship&mdash;how much energy to acquire, who to court, how much information to gather, when to give up, etc. In the mating market, males and females haggle during courtship, with their bargaining positions determined by their assets (foraging success and body condition) as well as the number of alternative partners for each. Thus economic models of negotiation in a market provide a framework for studying courtship behaviors. This project explored this framework by examining how the habitat use and diet of greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>) affects its courtship behaviors and breeding success. In the spring, male sage-grouse display on open breeding grounds called &lsquo;leks&rsquo;, which allow us to observe the courtship and mating behaviors of individual birds throughout the breeding season (Figures 1 &amp; 2). We studied sage-grouse in the wild with minimal disturbance using new technology, including interactive female robots to study courtship behaviors experimentally (Figure 3), next-generation GPS loggers and accelerometers to measure off-lek foraging behaviors (Figures 4 &amp; 5), and bioanalytical assays of the nutritional quality and toxicity of sagebrush plants preferred as forage. Our four field seasons yielded hundreds of hours of audio and video and hundreds of sagebrush samples, some of which is still being analyzed with the help of undergraduate and graduate students at UC Davis and Boise State University.</p>\n<p>Our studies addressed four major objectives. In Objective 1, we examined courtship tactics&mdash;how males adjust their courtship effort and persistence with differences in female behavior. We found that males adjust their effort according to signals indicating female interest in mating (Figure 2), with successful males displaying at higher levels regardless of female behaviors. In Objective 2, we examined tactical allocation of reproductive effort across multiple time scales, testing the interdependency of off-lek behavior and on-lek display effort. We found dramatic declines in display effort across the season, with some males declining more than others; analyses of diet quality and foraging efficiency are nearly complete and will help to explain these patterns. In Objective 3, we manipulated &ldquo;outside options&rdquo; available to males during courtship by presenting multiple female robots exhibiting the same or different behaviors and by manipulating the visual and acoustic environment of the lek (adding barriers to manipulate who could see the robotic females; playing female sounds to manipulate perception of female presence or absence). These experiments allow us to examine courtship tactics for both sexes and inform lek restoration efforts by linking habitat variation on leks to reproductive behaviors. In Objective 4, we examined sage-grouse foraging behavior relative to the location, nutritional quality and toxicity of their food, and how this changes with lek size. We are currently finalizing the analysis of diet quality (protein and toxins) and habitat (sagebrush structure, forb cover) at foraging sites, transects and random sites. Analyses thus far show differences in the concentrations of some (but not all) sagebrush toxins between Wyoming and Idaho sites, between leks of different size, and in the same plants after herbivory.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Sage-grouse are an iconic species of western North America and the focus of decades of research addressing the evolution of elaborate breeding displays and lekking behaviors. Populations of sage-grouse have declined by ~95%, leading to their consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act and one of the largest cooperative conservation efforts in US history. The PIs are engaged in research focused on conservation of sage-grouse and sagebrush habitats, including studies addressing the impacts of noise pollution on sage-grouse breeding, the impacts of habitat restoration treatments on diet quality, and the development of non-invasive bioassays of population health. This project contributes to those ongoing efforts, providing information about how habitat quality and movement patterns relate to reproductive success. The PIs are actively engaged in communicating results from these studies to wildlife and land managers.</p>\n<p>An additional goal of this project is to educate people about sage-grouse conservation. The PIs conducted outreach combining audio, video, and demonstrations of the robotic grouse to people of all ages in Wyoming, Idaho and California (Figure 6). We developed ongoing programs to train K-12 teachers and engage local school kids in citizen science: in Idaho, students collect data about the habitat and behavior of sage-grouse and other sagebrush-dependent species (<a href=\"http://theidahowatch.wixsite.com/idahowatch\">IdahoWatch</a>), and in California, students collect and analyze images from trail cameras placed on nearby leks (via <a href=\"https://yccs.ucdavis.edu/content/blog-zooniverse-research-tool\">Zooniverse</a>). Over the course of this project, we produced 32 publications and 44 conference presentations.
