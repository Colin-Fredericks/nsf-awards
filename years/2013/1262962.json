 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT).  The focus of the REU program will be chemically-mediated aquatic processes. The proposed 10-week summer internship program will provide laboratory and field-based research expertise to ten undergraduate students from across the nation each summer for three years. GIT faculty in Civil & Environmental Engineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Biology will form a core group of mentors and will guide undergraduates in basic and applied research on multiple phases of chemically-mediated processes, stressing interdisciplinary research as a tool to solve complex problems. Each student will complete an independent research project and will give written and oral presentations on their research. They will be encouraged to attend a professional conference after the summer program. Funding supports student stipends, travel to the site, housing and some research expenses.",
