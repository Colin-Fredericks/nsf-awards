 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of the TeraNets project is to establish the theoretical foundations of ultra-broadband communication networks in the terahertz (THz) Band. New channel models for the entire THz Band will be developed. These will account for line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight and multi-path propagation and will capture the peculiarities of molecular absorption and scattering from rough surfaces. Bandwidth-adaptive modulations to exploit the distance-dependent behavior of the bandwidth at THz Band frequencies will be developed. In addition, massive MIMO transmission schemes to increase the communication distance and novel channel coding approaches to efficiently overcome channel errors at THz Band frequencies are to be investigated. Finally, novel Medium Access Control protocols for THz Band communication networks are proposed, which capture the peculiarities of the physical layer and take advantage of large antenna arrays and dielectric mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe TeraNets project is expected to pave the way for research in communication networks in the THz Band. Ultra-broadband communication networks will play a major role in society within the next ten years by drastically increasing the capacity of wireless networks, and enabling long-awaited applications not possible with current wireless technologies. In addition, the THz Band is not yet regulated. The project team is actively involved in IEEE 802.15 WPAN Terahertz Interest Group (IGThz), whose objective is to create the first standard for this paradigm. The research results will be incorporated into the Information and Network Theory and Wireless Communication and Networks within the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, both at undergraduate and graduate levels.  This, combined with grauate student resarch mentoring, will produce new experts in this nascent field. The research results will be disseminated in important scientific conferences, journals and premier magazines of the field.",
