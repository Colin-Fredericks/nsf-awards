 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR MSC) to acquire a state-of-the-art Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM).  This instrument overcomes obstacles that previously limited the detection and precise localization of fluorescent signals within nervous systems and other complex three-dimensional structures.  The LSCM will be housed at the Institute of Neurobiology (IN), a freestanding unit of the UPR MSC.  Eleven laboratories that comprise the IN utilize a variety of model systems, ranging from the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila to mammalian neurons in cell culture, to address some of the most challenging issues facing modern neuroscience.  The LSCM will benefit the entire neuroscience community of Puerto Rico as well as investigators in other disciplines that require precise spatial localization of fluorescent markers within biological tissues.\r\n\r\nIn addition to enhancing research objectives, acquisition of cutting-edge imaging instrumentation will significantly impact the educational goals and capabilities of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. The proposed instrumentation will benefit students associated with two major NSF-supported initiatives: the Undergraduate Research Mentoring (URM) program in Neural Networks and Behavior which supports year-round investigation by undergraduate students in neuroscience labs throughout the island, and the Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) in Environmental Neuroscience which partners neurobiologists with ecologists investigating the effects of anthropogenic factors on nervous system function.  Finally, this instrumentation will promote collaborations between the UPR and leading international investigators, providing opportunities for students to receive a part of their training at major research institutions. Such experiences greatly expand their horizons and ultimately lead to broadened participation in the nation's STEM workforce.",
