 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than three decades, the slowest and most limiting component in computer systems has been the disk-based file system.  For that reason, file systems have consistently been a critical area of computer systems research.  One of the most useful techniques for studying file systems is to collect, analyze, and replay detailed activity traces.  In the past, traces have been used for retrospective analysis and as a source of workloads for both simulation and live experiments.  However, many file-system studies have been handicapped by a lack of publicly available trace data, often causing experiments to be performed using inadequate data sets.  In many cases, those data sets are not published for use by other researchers, making comparative studies difficult or impossible.\r\n\r\nIn this work, the PIs are operating and expanding IOTTA Trace Repository (after the Storage Networking Industry Association's I/O Tools, Traces, and Analysis Working Group) that makes standardized, high-quality data sets available to researchers worldwide.  This repository is widely known in the research community as the most reliable source of file system and I/O trace data, and has proven its worth by providing data sets to hundreds of research projects worldwide each year. The project involves defining standard formats and then creating tools to make it easy to work with traces, despite their immense size. Because the trace repository is inherently a community effort, it is supervised by an advisory panel of experienced researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA trace is a detailed record of the actions that a computer takes to\nsolve a particular problem.  For example, a file system trace might\nnote that as part of working on a text document, the computer first\nneeded to read the files that hold the document, then access various\nfonts, images, and a spelling dictionary.  Because modern computers\nare so complex, it is impossible to predict their behavior ahead of\ntime, so traces provide valuable insight that can be used to develop\nfaster, more reliable systems.\n\nThe problem with file system traces is that they are extremely large\nand difficult to collect.  A typical tracing project might take 1-2\nyears of work and produce results that are larger than a typical disk\ndrive.  As a result, the traces that we have are considered to be rare\nand valuable.  Nevertheless, historically it has been difficult to\nfind existing traces, and the Web sites where they were stored have\noften been unreliable and short-lived.\n\nThe National File Systems Trace Repository (also known as the SNIA\nIOTTA Trace Repository) serves as a central collection of all known\ntraces of computer storage systems.  Researchers from around the world\ncan contribute traces to the repository, secure in the knowledge that\nthey will be preserved and made available to other researchers who\nneed them for their own studies.  The repository has been online for\nten years, and during that time over 200 research papers have been\npublished using data collected by the repository.\n\nThe current project provided for the maintenance, upkeep, and\nexpansion of the repository from 2012 to 2017.  During that time we\nadded a number of newly collected traces, created two mirrors spread\naround the country to ensure that users could access the traces\nquickly, expanded the storage available for new traces, and enhanced\noverall site reliability.  We also trained 2-4 undergraduate students\nper year in research techniques, Web development, and system\nadministration; the ones who have already graduated have gone on to\ncareers in the tech industry or to graduate school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoff Kuenning"
