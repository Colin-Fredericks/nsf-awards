 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mixed methods research project investigates the puzzling problem of variations in student learning gains that are observed at different institutions of higher education when implementing the same research-based instructional method in highly interactive classrooms. The study investigates model implementations of algebra-based studio physics to identify and analyze the critical features of this instructional method.  The study is guided by the following questions.  Research Question1: How is algebra-based studio physics implemented at a variety of institutions and for what types of students?  Research Question2: Why are departments implementing algebra-based studio physics in those ways?  Research Question3: What factors are associated with student outcomes that indicate student learning gains? Algebra-based studio physics comprise the physics experience for many students who enroll in introductory physics courses.  However, this approach to teaching physics remains understudied relative to calculus-based studio physics. Therefore, the research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to examine student learning gains.  The study examines how different types of students respond to interactive teaching strategies in model implementations of this instructional method to teach physics and how institutional types influence teaching and learning. Three initial institutions serve as the basis for Phase 1 of this multi-phase study. One of the institutions has reported high student learning gains in the algebra-based studio physics courses.  The other two institutions have observed low student learning gains. Phase 1 is designed to establish baseline measures for the research.  During Phase 2 the research team is examining a total of twelve additional institutions that utilize algebra-based studio physics.  The twelve institutions represent a range of those in the U.S. implementing this approach. Institutions that are included in Phase 2 provide settings in which the research team tests emergent hypotheses and the robustness of findings from Phase 1. Specifically, the project is investigating (a) characteristics of model implementations of algebra-based studio physics by faculty at different institutions and (b) the characteristics of students engaged in these types of courses, to investigate and explain the observed variations in student learning gains.  Research methods include classroom observations, interviews, surveys, and student outcomes assessments.",
