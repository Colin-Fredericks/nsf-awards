 "awd_abstract_narration": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM), the gas reservoir outside galaxies, mediates the interaction between galaxies and the intergalactic medium, where most of the baryonic matter in the universe resides. Its structure and kinematics influence star formation and the growth of galaxies; but knowledge of the CGM remains limited both observationally and theoretically. The proposers of this project will combine simulations and observations of the CGM to constrain theories of galaxy formation. In the first part of the project, the team will develop new computational schemes for selectively improving resolution in adaptive mesh cosmological simulations and for using \"active particles\" to model the stellar component including momentum feedback from supernova explosions. They will use this approach to examine the dynamic evolution of halo gas in a cosmological context as it is integrated into a galactic disk. In the second part, the team will devise quantitative measures describing the distributions of gas components in physical and kinematic space. They will use these measures to compare high resolution simulations with multi-wavelength observations, test theories of gas accretion, and determine whether large, organized flows are present in the halo of the Milky Way. The project will support the work of a graduate student. Three-dimensional visualizations of the simulations will be produced and displayed at astronomy outreach events in New York City and at the American Museum of Natural History; and team members will participate in an ongoing program at Columbia University to bring graduate students and postdocs to New York middle schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGalaxies, including the Milky Way, have long been known to be composed of stars, which are easily visible by their optical emission.  However, it has recently become clear that most if not all galaxies are surrounding by large halos of very diffuse gas, extending to distances one hundred times larger than their optical radii.  This circumgalactic gas, as it is known, is likely to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies, both as a reservoir of material which can accrete on to the galaxy and form new stars, and as a possible destination for the gas-rich outflows that many, rapidly star-forming galaxies appear to possess.  Unfortunately, this gaseous halo is very difficult to observe directly because it is incredibly diffuse and so emits and absorbs lightly only feebly.  However, it may contain a significant fraction of the total census of regular (non-dark) matter in galaxies.\n\nIn this project, we undertook a systematic theoretical and observational study of this gas reservoir.  On the theoretical front, we used large-scale numerical simulations to create detailed models of a full galaxy starting from cosmologically-appropriate initial conditions as well as idealized models of a small portion of a galaxy. We showed that the circumgalactic gas could cool and condense into small droplets which could rain down on to the galaxy, generating new stars (or accreting on to a large black hole), leading to outflows and heating; such a cycle leads to a number of predictions in agreement with existing observations.  We also investigated the rotation of the gas in this reservoir in the simulations, demonstrating that its angular momentum content was significant.\n\nOn the observational side, we used Hubble Space Telescope observations of bright sources behind our galaxies gas reservoir to look for signs that the gas is absorbing some of the light from those sources.  We first used numerical simulations to compare and demonstrated that while such probes did detect signs of gas in the Milky Way, half of our own gas reservoir is hidden behind gas that lies much closer to us, biases previous estimates low.  We then put together a new sample of such absorbers seen with Hubble to demonstrate that the Milky Way?s circumgalactic gas was indeed traced out by those absorbers.\n\nThis work help to support a range of broader impacts, including a project by two graduate students supported on this grant to found a new chapter, at Columbia, of an outreach program called Open Labs.  This program sponsors Science Cafes, where graduate students give TED-like talks about their research to an audience of middle and high school students.
