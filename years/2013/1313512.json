 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's magnetic field varies on a variety of time scales, with perhaps the best known example being the significant changes in the direction of local magnetic north documented in historic times. In addition to these short term variations, there are many documented reversals of the polarity of the field during geologic history. The change in polarity through recent geologic time has been well documented and provides a key method of dating geological events and establishing the past motions of tectonic plates. The Earth's magnetic field also exhibits profound variations in intensity. For example, the intensity of the field has decreased by approximately 10% in historic time and five-fold variations in intensity have been documented over longer time scales. A comprehensive description of magnetic field variations, in direction and intensity and over a wide range of time scales, is desirable as these fluctuations can provide critical constraints on how the magnetic field is generated as well as several other deep Earth processes. \r\n\r\nCompared with directional variations, documenting past intensity fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field is much more difficult and, consequently, relatively few reliable determinations of absolute intensity (paleointensity) are available. This scarcity of paleointensity information is primarily the result of the difficulty in identifying geological materials that contain dominantly the very fine and stable magnetic particles that are required for determining paleointensity. We are investigating the potential of ash flow tuffs, generated by explosive volcanic eruptions, as a potential new material for paleointensity information. Although such deposits have the requisite fine magnetic particles, a variety of post-emplacement processes may potentially affect the ability to recover ancient field intensity information. As a test of this material, we are documenting the post-emplacement thermal history and determining paleointensity for samples from two historical ash flows. The 1980 ash flows at Mt. St. Helens, Washington, and the 1912 flows from Mt. Katmai in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Alaska provide a natural laboratory for testing measured paleointensities against known field values. Direct temperature measurements at both localities constrain the emplacement temperature, and significant information is available on the conditions of post-emplacement fumarolic activity. Combined with focused studies in the older (0.76 Ma), better-exposed Bishop Tuff, our sampling strategy will allow us to evaluate the suitability of ash flows for paleointensity analysis, as well as the feasibility of identifying (in the field or lab) samples most likely to provide reliable results. The proposed work will provide valuable information to to guide future workers in both the field and the laboratory in the selection of suitable materials for paleointensity analysis. Ash flows (many with high quality radiometric ages) are common worldwide and commonly can be isotopically dated with high precision. Thus, if absolute paleointensities can be determined from ash flows, it may be possible to compile a much more comprehensive database of past field intensity fluctuations of the geomagnetic field. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific goals of this project, the research is providing training for a graduate student at Scripps Institute of Oceanography and training of two undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota. Additional undergraduate student participation is being encouraged by participation of students from the University of Minnesota?s NSF-Research Experience of Undergraduates (REU) program. \r\n",
