 "awd_abstract_narration": "West Texas A&M University's (WTAMU) Connecting Community College Transfers for STEM Success Times Two (C3X2) project provides at least eighteen scholarships yearly to community college transfer students majoring in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).  C3X2's goal is to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of students completing degrees in all STEM fields by providing academic, social, and financial support.   \r\n\r\nC3X2 recruits STEM community college (CC) transfers to WTAMU through personal contact advertisements, scholarship assistance and outreach to scholars from Amarillo College's  S-STEM program (DUE-1059696), encouraging them to continue their STEM education at WTAMU. \r\n\r\nC3X2 increases STEM CC transfers' academic achievement by integrating scholars into the WTAMU STEM community.   Scholars attend the university's new Transfer Orientation and during their first semester participate in a STEM transfer seminar course, addressing \"transfer shock.\"  Quality faculty-student and student-student relationships are developed through faculty advising and peer mentoring.  Monthly seminars and social activities provide opportunities for Industry-student mentoring.     \r\n\r\nC3X2 partners with six regional CCs with diverse student bodies in a region with a rapidly growing Hispanic population. The diversity of C3X2 leaders provides role models for all students and equips them to lead the C3X2 research efforts targeting CC transfer student retention and graduation in a rural, low-income, first-generation population.  Since most WTAMU graduates stay in the region, increasing the diversity of STEM graduates also increases the diversity of the region's STEM workforce.",

The goal was accomplished through two tasks:  1) Recruit Community College STEM students to transfer to the four-year institution; and 2) Increase the academic achievement of STEM CC Transfers.\n\n35 Community College STEM majors were financially, academically, and socially supported through C3x2 since its inception.  This cohort was over 50% hispanic and over 50% female.  Seven students (20%) left the program.  Of the seven, two students left the institution and did not return, one eventually graduated in Mechanical Engineering and another graduated with a degree in General Studies, three additional scholars became financially ineligible but graduated with a STEM degree.  Thus combined, thirty C3x2 scholars (83%) graduated and are employed in a STEM field or continuing onto graduate studies.  This has been a highly impressive program; only two students left the institution over the lifetime of the grant and one additional student graduated without a STEM degree. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pamela Lockwood"
