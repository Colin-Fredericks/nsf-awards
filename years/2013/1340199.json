The proposed conference will improve US exposure of some of the most promising Japanese scientists in the field of biosensors.  This conference will help form bridges between young biosensors and nanotechnology scientists in the two countries.  This program will broaden horizons of US scientists and spark further travel, cross-dissemination and ultimately will bring scientists from the two countries closer together.  This conference may also result in collaborative projects between scientists from two countries.",
