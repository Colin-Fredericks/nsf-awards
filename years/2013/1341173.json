 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean scientists, particularly those in the academic research community, to participate in the activities of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). This organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded through this award. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe availability of travel funds not only provides influence on the scientific planning for large scale international collaborations, but also provides the opportunity to entrain colleagues and graduate students into research collaborations, scientific sessions, and workshops. The scale of the North Pacific Ocean demands broad collaboration, and the intellectual merits of international collaboration leads to increased understanding of how diverse scientists address their research. Entrainment of young scientists from both the US and foreign countries into these collaborations represents one of the capacity building strategies of PICES, and one which has a broader impact on US science through appreciation of the diverse multicultural approaches to science. Funds have been add sufficient funds to this project to provide full travel support for young (<35 yr of age) academic scientists to the PICES annual meeting. With matching funds from PICES this will allow participation by 3 young academic scientists annually.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major use of NSF funds for this project is to provide travel funding assistance to enable US academic scientists to participate as needed in intersessional meetings (e.g, Science Board interim meeting, working group meetings), the annual PICES meeting and major symposiums organized by PICES.  Decisions on funding are based on value to the organization and are restricted by the limits established in the proposal.  Priority is given for travel to annual PICES meetings.  US academics requesting travel support for PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea provided information on estimated travel costs, the funding requested, and described their contributions and roles at the PICES meeting (e.g., committee or working group membership, papers to be presented, sessions chaired, etc.). Decisions on travel support are made approximately 3 months prior to the meeting, in time for early registration and abstract submission to PICES.  US academic and non-governmental scientists eligible for travel funds from this award are all \"PICES Members\", defined as individuals who are members of official PICES expert groups.  For the reporting period there were 18 US academic scientists from 10 institutions in 6 states who are members in 18 PICES expert groups.  The NSF award provided partial or full travel support for 12 scientists to attend PICES 2014 in Yeosu. Altogether, these experts served on 3 scientific committees, 6 advisory panels or sections, and 4 working groups or study groups for PICES.  In addition to their role as PICES members, they served as convenors or co-convenors for 8 of the scientific sessions or workshops.  They were authors or co-authors of 23 scientific papers or posters.  As in past years, we continue efforts to increase the number of PICES academics whose travel can be supported by requesting matching funding from scientists who are able to use other funds to support their travel. \n\nPICES and the NSF agreed to share equally the costs of supporting up to three early career scientists (ECS) to attend the PICES annual meeting.  For PICES-2014 in Yeosu, Korea there were three US ECS whose travel was partially supported by this award.  Residual funds in this award were provided to three early career scientists to attend the 3rd Effects of Climate Change on the World?s Oceans Symposium in March 2015.\n\nAll funds from the first-year award were disbursed through the support provided to PICES members to attend the Nanaimo, Canada PICES-2013 meeting, the Yeosu, Korea PICES-2014 meeting, and the Santos, Brazil (ECCWO-3) meeting.\n\nThe US has consistent participation by academic scientists, contrasting with several other PICES member nations, many of which have a much higher percentage of participants from Federal Laboratories/Agencies.  US Academic scientists make up a large percentage (&gt;44%) of the US participants in the annual meetings from 2004 to 2014.  Numbers fluctuate with distance to the meeting, with lower numbers typical for meetings in Asia (Russia in 2011, Korea in 2009, China in 2008, Japan 2012) and higher numbers for meetings in the US (2010) and Canada (2013).  The percentages of US academic scientists, however, remains relatively stable at 40-57% of total US participation (2006-2012 avg) most years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold P Batchelder"
