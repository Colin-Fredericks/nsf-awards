Many of the technologies resulting from this research are not being effectively utilized because of issues rooted in human judgment under risk and uncertainty.  The majority of existing models and products related to human judgement are based on a limited number of documented incidents and on questionable assumptions about user intent and behavior. To better develop and apply privacy technologies requires better methods of understanding and measuring  human perceptions of privacy.\r\n \r\nIn this project we are investigating the underlying neurobiological manifestations of privacy, and seeing to understand -- and measure --  variations of uncertainty in online privacy decisions. The outcomes of this proposed project will contribute to answering fundamental questions about human behavior in online environments?e.g., under what circumstances do systems in the mind cooperate or compete in privacy decisions? When there is competition, how and where is it adjudicated? Do higher-level deliberative processes rely similarly on multiple mechanisms, or a single, unitary set of mechanisms?  We anticipate these results being used to further refine and develop useful privacy policies and technologies.",
