 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables Villanova to purchase and further develop an interactive virtual reality system known as a System for Immersive Video Research, Immersive Learning, and Visualization Support for Research (CAVE) at Villanova University. The Falvey Memorial Library at Villanova will house the facility.  CAVE technology's ability to provide immersive experiences of rendered environments is well-known. This project proposes development of a CAVE system with mobile immersive spherical video technology to capture photorealistic representations of real world environments without involved modeling. This development project has two facets. The first lies in the integration of mobile immersive spherical video camera equipment with a CAVE to display real-world environments, thereby reducing environmental modeling time. This approach will permit greater usage of CAVE technology for disseminating immersive views of significant locations or phenomena without concern for the displayed material appearing too unrealistic. The second facet is the project's visualization support for research across many domains. CAVE placement near the greater Philadelphia area will permit increased public access to the learning possibilities of the equipment, as well as support the collection and dissemination of immersive videos of culturally significant locations such as the Vatican Museum's facilities that are often not able to be visited by large crowds. Understanding how to systematically use CAVE technology in libraries has the potential to transform these institutions into social and collaborative environments, called public Collaboratories. Classrooms for CAVE use will be established.",

A significant challenge for applying VR involves acquisition or creation of display content.&nbsp;However, not all STEM fields have a large number of practitioners with the necessary graphics experience to create and render immersive content cost-effectively for visually testing research hypotheses or for teaching topics that benefit from viewing a 3-dimensional world from various viewpoints.</p>\n<p>The research goal and intellectual merit of this development major research infrastructure project was to develop a visualization system that combined a CAVE platform with a mobile rover carrying a 360-degree spherical video camera. CAVEs, first developed in 1992, are immersive viewing enclosures in which the walls are rear-projection screens.&nbsp;&nbsp;A viewer in a CAVE wears 3D glasses to see the immersive world being projected around them. This project chose to work with the CAVE platform because its capacity to hold many viewers (5-20) allows for research and education uses that include group collaborations as part of the experience. This project's visualization system used spherical video transmitted over an internet connection from a mobile robot to help researchers and educators display the video on the CAVE's walls to immersive worlds without incurring the cost of many weeks of programming to create detailed rendered worlds in a graphics package such as Unity 3D or Unreal.</p>\n<p>The system that was developed in this project uses a CAVE with five projecting surfaces, four of which could be active at the same time. [Image001] shows this project's CAVE. The CAVE has a extendable ceiling that allows for viewing experiences that use either the three enclosing walls with a ceiling, or the three enclosing walls with a floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its 18-foot wide x 10-foot deep x 7.5-foot high enclosure can hold up to 20 people at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Image002] shows the mobile rover that is linked to the CAVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;The video visualization system has been used in psychology experiments that investigated the role of environments on task performance. It has also been used in civil engineering experiments that investigated subject reactions to dangerous road and traffic scenarios.</p>\n<p>While working with groups of students in educational applications, our research team found that instructors often stood in front of a student group while using a joystick to control panning and zooming video in the CAVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;This positioning tended to interfere with students' viewing experience. But when instructors tried to accommodate by standing behind the student group, the instructors' view of the video became obstructed in turn, causing them to often lose track of what they were trying to show the students within a spherical video.&nbsp;In response, this project developed a novel control interface based on tablets. The new system allows an instructor to \"teach from behind\" the group while still being able to see the video on the tablet screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor uses gestures to control panning, zooming, and pointing in the video, and can see on his/her own tablet what is the current focus of attention being shown in the front of the CAVE enclosure. [Image003] shows a still shot of an iPad tablet being used to control the playback of a spherical video of a busy street by an airport.</p>\n<p>This project's broader impact within the education arena includes support for CAVE-based technology as a framework for groups of students to collaborate in their learning.&nbsp;Instructors that partnered with this project to use the CAVE system in their courses found&nbsp;&nbsp;that it naturally encouraged students to discuss with each other how to navigate through both video-based and graphically-rendered worlds. This was due in large part to the fact that a CAVE's 3D viewing glasses permit students to see each other while immersed in their learning experience. This is not as readily achievable with head-mounted displays, except when they are linked together in high-speed networks, along with tracking technology to reproduce all students' body motions in each other's viewscreens. These findings were supported not only in STEM-oriented courses such as the computer engineering laboratory module in [Image004] that helped students visualize the structure of silicon crystals, but also in liberal arts courses as shown in [Image005], where art history students are exploring the design of St. Peter's Square in Rome.</p>\n<p>This project's system has helped significantly increase the use of VR on the Villanova host campus. As of close of this project's grant, the CAVE facility is being used by over 1200 visitors (students, instructors, researchers), which is slightly over one-fifth of the undergraduate
