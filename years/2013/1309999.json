 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Methicillin-resistant Straphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is antibiotic-resistant and spread by hand-to-surface contact with metal surfaces, often leading to hospital patient infection. Copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) possess anti-microbial capability due to the release of either oxidized Cu or Ag ions via electrochemical processes in response to complex surface environments formed during deliquescence of perspiration salt deposits in humid air. Cu surfaces are not presently favored in hospitals due to rapid tarnishing caused by hand perspiration. A Cu alloy that has antimicrobial capability and color stability is highly desirable for high touch surfaces where stainless steel is now used but has no antimicrobial capabilities. The ideal alloy surface releases Cu ions at rates mediated via alloying. However, there is a gap in scientific understanding of electrochemical Cu oxidation, passivity and release from copper alloys. Few past studies focus on the role of major and minor alloying elements on Cu release from alloys. Prior research on commercial alloys confirms the complex effects of alloying elements; alloying elements may either suppress or enhance release of Cu ions by mechanisms which are presently unknown. The objective is to elucidate the Cu release characteristics and mechanisms in selected Cu alloys as mediated by systematic variation of alloying elements. The effects of alloying on copper release, passivity and color stability will be investigated using binary and ternary Cu alloys synthesized with systematic additions of selected alloying elements. Corrosion/release behavior will be connected with atomic scale measurements of the fate of alloying elements during oxidation. Both global and high resolution surface and atomic scale experimental studies using a variety of techniques will track the fate of Cu in the metal, the oxide as well as the flux released. Intellectual merits include new solid/liquid interfacial understandings of the role of major and minor alloying elements on these processes. A foundation for functional alloy design that improves trial and error approaches will emerge.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This project concerns developing the materials science which enables better design of copper and silver based alloys that have anti-microbial functionality as a way to ultimately control hospital acquired infections. For instance, Methicillin-resistant Straphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is antibiotic-resistant and spread by hand-to-surface contact, often leading to infection. Copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) metallic alloys possess anti-microbial function due to the release of metal ions in response to complex chemical environments such as human sweat. Cu is not favored in hospitals due to rapid tarnishing caused by hand perspiration. Stainless steels resist tarnishing but do not possess any antimicrobial capability. This project seeks to identify and understand factors controlling alloy properties that enable both antimicrobial function and color stability. These properties are highly desirable for high touch surfaces. This project will conduct research to define the Cu release characteristics and mechanisms in selected Cu alloys as mediated by selected alloying elements. Intellectual merits include new understandings of the role of alloying elements on copper alloy oxidation/ion release in human perspiration. This will enable intelligent design of alloy compositions for ideal anti-microbial function and minimal tarnishing. Broader implications include development of the insight necessary to enable use of multi-functional copper alloys in anti-microbial applications to reduce the spread of disease-causing bacteria. This can positively affect world health, and also contribute to understanding of metal release in other applications. Significant human resource development will occur in the fields of materials science and engineering as well as corrosion science - crucial gaps in STEM training and a national need identified by the US National Academy. Graduate students in the materials science area will be educated and fully integrated with all research tasks. Undergraduate as well as high school students will also participate. Collaboration is underway with the Copper Development Association of America and various copper alloy producers.",

This was achieved, whereby a certain compositional range of solid solution Cu-Al-Sn alloys were found to be both antimicrobial and tarnish-resistant, able to kill all planktonic E. Coli under 24 hours in using a custom disinfection test.</p>\n<p>Copper has been shown to kill/inactivate even antibiotic-resistant so-called ?superbugs?, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The copper surface itself is not antimicrobial, but the soluble Cu ions that it releases into the local environment, through the process of corrosion, are responsible for the antimicrobial efficacy of the copper. To provide effective long-term antimicrobial function, remain aesthetically acceptable in public spaces, copper can be alloyed with different elements to optimize the corrosion that occurs in terms of oxide formation (surface tarnishing) and ion release for antimicrobial function. Corrosion is the essential link between metal alloying and antimicrobial performance, but the effect of alloying on these factors is not yet fully understood. A number of different ?fates? of the elements is possible, such as oxide formation, direct cation ejection, metal salt precipitation, and preferential solute dissolution (i.e. dealloying or incongruent dissolution). A general rule is that copper alloys that contain more than 65% copper will provide an antimicrobial effect. However, not all alloy systems are equally effective and the critical copper ion concentration necessary for timely reduction in bacteria colony population (i.e., a dose-response relationship) is not yet clear. Furthermore, there are key limitations whereby the use of toxic alloying elements, or those that cause dealloying (a specific type of corrosion where certain solutes are released preferentially) and allergic responses, are off limits.</p>\n<p>The objective of the project was to investigate the effects of two specific alloying elements, Al and Sn, on the corrosion and antimicrobial response of the alloy. These were studied as a function of alloy composition in binary and ternary alloy systems designed with attributes favorable for Cu ion release, where Sn is favorable, and corrosion/tarnish resistance, where Al is favorable (summarized in the plot given in Figure 1a). This was accomplished by determining the ?fate of the elements? by measuring corrosion rates and Cu ion release and by quantitatively comparing the composition, structure, and molecular identities of all corrosion products - including oxides and precipitated compounds (illustrated in the schematic given in Figure 1b). This data enabled an understanding of pertinent phenomena, in particular, enhanced release and passivation, as regulated by Sn and Al (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Sn was shown to enhance Cu dissolution by affecting the anodic dissolution kinetics of Cu in Cu-Sn systems (Figure 3). This could be mediated by the formation of a protective inner layer of SnO<sub>2</sub> under a Cu<sub>2</sub>O surface film (shown in the SEM images given in Figure 4). The minimum alloying amount of Sn needed for complete layer coverage of SnO<sub>2</sub> was determined through a new theoretical framework for specifying the critical alloying content for passivation in duplex films. This was based on solute enrichment theory and wetting phenomena governed by the interphase surface energies of insoluble oxides (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>The new framework could not be applied to the oxide found in Cu-Al alloys, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, because this oxide was not found as a phase-separated oxide co-existing with Cu<sub>2</sub>O, nor as a Cu-Al-O phase as predicted from high temperature phase equilibria. Instead, Al<sup>3+</sup> was observed to dope the Cu<sub>2</sub>O oxide as evidenced by structural, chemical, and electronic modifications to the Cu<sub>2</sub>O oxide, indicating a metastable oxide. This dopant effect led to a formation of a thinner, more tarnish-resistant oxide than that observed in Al-free alloys. It was found that these doped Cu<sub>2</sub>O oxides performed the desired dual functionality i.e. resistance to tarnishing without impeding copper ion release. Investigations of ternary Cu-Al-Sn alloys over a range of compositions in the single-phase region demonstrated that the function of Sn-enhanced Cu dissolution operated concurrently, and possibly synergistically, with Al-doping of Cu<sub>2</sub>O and high tarnish-resistance. This combination of properties, applied to the copper alloying system, permitted both antimicrobial yet tarnish-resistant functions within a certain compositional range of solid solution Cu-Al-Sn alloys.</p>\n<p>The key achievements of this project advance the science of alloy design, moving away from trial-and-error approaches towards integrated computation-experimental design. As such, the dose-response behavior of the alloys can be established, and mechanistic understanding is developed regarding the role(s) of each element in terms of phase equilibria, defect chemistry, electrochemistry and surface science. A specific alloy composition, tuned to serve a very important societal function that avoids alloying elements which cause preferential solute release dealloying, allergic responses, toxicity, or non-aesthetic tarnishing was found.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Scully</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1309999/1309999_10269541_1571952011898_Slide6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1309999/1309999_10269541_1571952011898_Slide6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 6\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1309999/1309999_10269541_1571952011898_Slide6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Mass loss compared with soluble Cu (black) and reducible corrosion product charge from coulometric reduction (blue) for Cu-Al-Sn alloys and (b) visual condition of Cu-Al-Sn alloys following 96 h at open circuit in naturally aerated artificial perspiration solution.
