 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) provides funds to acquire a Multi-Collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) for the Isotope Geology Laboratory (IGL) of the Department of Geosciences, Boise State University, as the next step in creating a national multi-user facility for high-precision geochronology. The IGL is dedicated to the calibration of Earth history and quantification of the rates of geological processes through the application of high-precision U-Th-Pb geochronology and radiogenic isotope tracers. Since its creation, the IGL has established itself as a critical node in the isotope geochronological community through its efforts with the EARTHTIME Initiative for the Calibration of Earth History. The requested instrument will complement the existing TIMS and LA-ICPMS equipment in the Isotope Geology Laboratory, and will be specifically tasked with expanding community access to high-precision U-Th-Pb geochronology. The instrumentation will be configured with the latest in ion-counting and high-ohmic Faraday amplifier technology, to continue innovations in the precise and accurate analysis of very small amounts of parent and daughter isotopes. Expansion of the analytical infrastructure of the IGL will help to meet the burgeoning geochronology needs of the national user community, for state-of-the-art applications including: high-precision, high-accuracy U-Pb dating for chronostratigraphy, paleobiology and paleoclimatology; tandem in situ (ion microprobe or LA-ICPMS) and chemical abrasion TIMS analysis of detrital zircons for robust maximum age constraints; coupling of in situ geochemical and isotopic analyses to high-precision analyses of the same grains to explore silicic volcanic and plutonic igneous processes; and the characterization and calibration of mineral standard materials for in situ geochronology and geochemistry. \r\n\r\nExpanding the instrumentation base of the Isotope Geology Laboratory is a sound investment capitalizing on existing infrastructure, a larger laboratory in the newly constructed Environmental Research Building, an exceptional personnel base of technical support, and a working and successful cost recovery management plan. Inreach to the scientific community will continue to center around student and early-career scientist training and multi-disciplinary integration. The Isotope Geology Laboratory will also continue to host a portfolio of in-person and web-based education and outreach activities including research-based science lessons to middle and high school students and community members via informal science education center partners, and a series of web-based learning objects to teach the science of geochronology and Earth history.",
