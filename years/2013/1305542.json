 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will integrate experiment and theory to measure and understand the relationship between fluctuations of various observed quantities and the responses of a living system to designed (pulsatile) perturbations. The approach centers on a unique technology that the PI has developed and implemented, combining microfluidics, single-cell imaging, quantitative analysis, and stochastic modeling of growth and division of Caulobacter crescentus.  The project seeks to employ this approach to evaluate models for growth control and the degree to which cells trade energy, speed, and accuracy; identify relations constraining the statistics of cell-cycle periods under steady and changing conditions; and engineer a system in which the interactions between cells in a population can be modulated to study spontaneous symmetry breaking.  These goals are important for establishing the fundamental physics of systems far from equilibrium.  They also provide examples as to how scaling and fluctuation relations can be used to provide direct constraints on regulatory dynamics.  In this way, these studies complement common biological methods for assembling information about molecular concentrations and interactions.  The investigator seeks to bring core concepts of the project, such as the importance of going beyond averages to study statistical distributions, to a broader audience interested in living systems.  To this end, the PI will develop a summer course to introduce high school teachers to basic concepts in probability, energy, and entropy in biological systems through hands-on experimentation and self-guided web-based tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the  Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",

Quantitative studies of bacteria can provide insights into single-cell growth and division but are challenging owing to the fact that these processes arise from many chance molecular events, such that only statistical conclusions can be drawn. To address this issue, we developed a unique combination of molecular biology, measurement, image analysis, and mathematical modeling that enabled us to obtain and interpret data for tens of thousands of Caulobacter crescentus cell division events.  These extensive data enabled us to resolve long-standing questions concerning bacterial growth and division.\n\n \n\nFirst, we were able to show that the sizes of individual cells grow exponentially, rather than linearly, with time.  In other words, the rate of mass addition is proportional to the amount of material already there.  There is evidence for exponential growth in other living systems, and it occurs in diverse non-biological contexts (e.g., cosmology, finance, Moore?s Law for computer processor power). While many exponential-growth processes involve chance events, surprisingly, there was no established microscopic theory.  We introduced a simple model of exponential growth that accounted for our observations and led to predictions that validated the model further.\n\n \n\nA number of different models did exist for division control.  For example, cells could divide when reaching a constant size (the \"sizer\" model) or at a constant interdivision time (the \"timer\" model).  Recently, several groups have suggested that bacterial cells divide when they add a set amount of volume or mass (the \"adder\" model).  Our data allowed us to go beyond simple quantification of the size and characterize the shapes of cells.  Examination of the width at the site of division revealed that growth has two stages:  initially the cells behave like a timer and then like an adder.  We were able to show experimentally that these two stages correspond to different growth mechanisms:  material addition is initially over the entire cell surface, then it is concentrated at the site of division. \n\n \n\nWe furthermore discovered that information about the site of division is passed from one generation to another via the mechanical properties of the cell.  This observation led to development of a general mechanical model that could account for the growth dynamics observed in Caulobacter crescentus and also other species of bacteria.  Interestingly, this model suggested that in Caulobacter crescentus molecular motors at the site of division direct growth of new cell wall rather than cinch existing material.  This model thus provides a unified explanation for how, when, and where cells divide.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron Dinner"
