 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Tech Digital Media program is conducting a workshop and developing a website that fosters collaborations among researchers in the learning sciences community who study informal learning, practitioners in STEM-related informal learning environments (ILEs), and professional artists whose work incorporates STEM concepts. This workshop explores how the intersection of culturally-situated, arts-based learning (ABL), informal STEM learning, and digital media can be leveraged to create higher interest, motivation and learning in STEM among under-represented minorities (URMs).  The workshop investigates the potential for combining culturally-situated design tools (CSDTs), contemporary art and crafts, and STEM concepts as a means to engage URM learners in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the workshop is to engage a dialog among STEM and ABL experts, professional artists and cultural practitioners whose work integrates STEM concepts through its content, methodology, and technological implementation.  Another goal of the workshop is to develop a professional community that can advance understanding of the potential impacts of culturally-situated design strategies and to present arts-based learning and research that can extend participation and understanding of STEM to more diverse audiences.",
