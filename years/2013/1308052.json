 "awd_abstract_narration": "GOALI: Intelligent Networked Solar Panel Array Management This three year GOALI proposal addresses several new signal processing, power, modeling, and control methods for optimizing photovoltaic (PV) arrays and inverters through Smart Monitoring Devices (SMD). The objectives for this GOALI project have been designed jointly by our faculty and industry partners and include: a) studying how the individual PV monitoring devices can improve solar panel array operation and efficiency, b) examining communication and networking methodologies for data flow through the system, and c) investigating optimization methodologies for the overall improvement of PV array and inverter performance. Based on these objectives our short term goals are: a) to develop intelligent, interactive PV monitoring technologies, b) to develop switching strategies for PV modules, c) to optimize PV array performance, d) to provide fault tolerant capabilities, e) to establish communications and networking among SMDs, servers and inverters, f) to provide anti-shading strategies and reduce mismatch, and g) to establish these innovations along with a tech transfer and IP roadmap for the GOALI project. The long term goal is to develop smart PV technologies that will help define new standards and protocols for PV array communication and control.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Scientific problems that the proposal addresses revolve around information extraction and processing from PV arrays and inverter units that are intended for utility scale power production. The PV data and information processing algorithms derived for these applications will impact many areas in solar array power production and distribution. More specifically they will result in designing and deploying effective and robust PV arrays that operate in near optimum conditions and are robust to faults, noise and weather changes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed work will advance the development of PV and inverter technologies. Our research will lead to inexpensive, smart, and robust PV units for utility scale applications. As a whole, our research will reduce the cost of energy by optimizing PV array and inverter operation. In the proposal, we describe a process to create compelling realizations of mobile iJDSP for dissemination and outreach of this PV monitoring research.",
