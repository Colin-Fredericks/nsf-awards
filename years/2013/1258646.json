The model is based on the chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA), which can identify local limit phenomena and elementary flamelets, and will be validated against high-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS).  The universal combustion model is capable of eliminating the need for empirical identification of local premixed and non-premixed conditions in practical engine simulations using large eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations.  The low-cost and reliable numerical simulations lead to a predictive tool for engine combustion, and expedite the design of advance IC engines with improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.  The collaboration among University of Connecticut, Sandia National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory is expected to bridge the needs of fundamental combustion research and practical engine simulations and to create rich opportunities for postdoctoral mentoring and graduate education.  Research opportunities will also be created through UConn?s outreach programs for undergraduate and high school teachers.  The PIs will collaborate with major CFD software companies to incorporate the new combustion model into commercial software and thus benefit the engine community at large.",
