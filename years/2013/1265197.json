As a result of recent meetings (2011, 2012) of the Science Planning and Education and Outreach Committees of DOSECC a plan was put into place to provide NSF with broad community input concerning specific CSD science objectives in six broad areas for which the Science Planning and Education and Outreach Committees concluded that significant opportunities existed for CSD advances in the near future:\r\n\r\n1) Scientific Drilling and the Evolution of the Earth System: Climate, Biota, Biogeochemistry, and Extreme Events.\r\n2) Drilling, active tectonics and magmatism (volcanics, fault zones, Geoprisms, post-SAFOD).\r\n3) Drilling into High-enthalpy Geothermal Systems: A Collaborative Initiative to Promote Scientific Opportunities.\r\n4) Drilling, sampling, and imaging the depths of the critical zone.\r\n5) EarthCube GEO Domain Workshop: Cyberinfrastructure for Paleogeoscience.\r\n6) Broadening the Scope of Education and Outreach to Enhance the Scientific and Societal Impacts of Continental Scientific Drilling.\r\n\r\nThis award will support an on-campus IT support analyst and an off-campus workshop coordinator who will both assist the individual conveners with routine pre- and mid-workshop tasks and, most importantly, will help assemble a combined workshop report that documents and synthesizes the findings of all of these meetings, vis-\u00e0-vis the needs of the continental scientific drilling community.",
