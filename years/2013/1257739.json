 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research aims to understand how plant-feeding insects adapt to their host plants and the extent to which this process leads to the formation of new species in nature. Whereas most pine sawflies feed only on a single type of pine, the redheaded pine sawfly (RHPS) is a major pest of multiple pine species throughout eastern North America. Using a combination of fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and DNA sequencing, the proposed project will determine whether: (1) RHPS are adapted to different pine species, (2) RHPS from different pines are genetically distinct, and (3) RHPS from different pines can produce offspring together, which will indicate whether these are distinct, unrecognized species.\r\n\r\nComprising ~25% of all species, plant-feeding insects are among the most diverse organisms on Earth. By describing how insects adapt to host plants and determining the link between adaptation and species formation, the proposed research will help explain the origin of a sizeable fraction of biodiversity. At an applied level, determining whether RHPS is comprised of multiple unrecognized species will have direct implications for managing outbreaks of this destructive pest. Additionally, this project's integrative nature provides an ideal training environment for undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, because host plant adaptation is an intuitive process and RHPS is part of the local fauna, this research can be used to convey basic evolutionary principles to Biology students. To this end, a related teaching module (lesson plans, presentations, activities, and assignments) will be developed and assessed in high schools in eastern Kentucky.",

The overarching goal of this grant was to test this hypothesis. To link host-plant adaptation to species formation, we focused on the redheaded pine sawfly (<em>Neodiprion lecontei</em>) and the white pine sawfly (<em>Neodiprion pinetum</em>), both economically important pine pests in eastern North America. Whereas <em>N. pinetum </em>feeds only on white pine (an exceptionally thin-needled pine), <em>N. lecontei </em>feeds on many different pine species, but avoids white pine. To test the hypothesis that adaptation to different plants is a major driver of insect speciation, we evaluated two predictions. First, looking within species, we predicted that there would be evidence of early stages of speciation (genetic, morphological, and behavioral differences) in <em>N. lecontei </em>populations that use different pine species. Second, looking between species, we predicted that traits related to differences in host use would be directly responsible for the inability of <em>N. lecontei </em>and <em>N. pinetum </em>to hybridize successfully in the wild.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using genomic data from hundreds of <em>N. lecontei </em>larvae collected on multiple pine species in eastern North America, we found that isolation in different glacial refugia, an inability to disperse across large distances, and adaptation to different host plants all contribute to genetic differences among populations (Fig. 1). We also found that differences in pine use are often associated with differences in the female ovipositor, a saw-like structure that females use to lay their eggs into pine needles (Fig. 2). Although these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in host use drive population divergence and species formation, we also found that at least some geographical or temporal isolation was required for genetic differences to accumulate across the genome. Moreover, our experiments revealed few reproductive barriers between <em>N. lecontei </em>populations, suggesting that despite some differences, all populations should be considered the same species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By contrast, strong reproductive barriers exist between <em>N. lecontei </em>and <em>N. pinetum</em>, which remain distinct despite occasional hybridization in the wild. We found that these barriers are due, in part, to adaptations to different pines. Whereas <em>N. pinetum </em>females have many different characteristics that enable them to lay their eggs in very thin pine needles (e.g., small ovipositors and a tendency to lay very few eggs per needle), <em>N. lecontei </em>females have traits that are better suited to thick pine needles. When we crossed these species in the lab, we found that the hybrids preferred to lay their eggs in thin needles (like <em>N. pinetum)</em>, but had large ovipositors and laid many eggs per needle (like <em>N. lecontei</em>). This unfortunate combination of traits caused the thin needles to dry out and the eggs to die, drastically reducing the reproductive success of the otherwise healthy and fertile hybrid females (Fig. 3). This research provides a striking example of how natural selection favoring different traits on different host plants can reduce gene exchange between diverging populations, ultimately leading to the formation of new species. In other words, we have connected microevolutionary change within species (adaptation to different hosts) to macroevolutionary consequences (species formation). To date, we have published 7 peer-reviewed manuscripts and one invited commentary based on this grant, with several more publications in preparation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond increasing our understanding of how new species form, our work had several broader impacts. First, our analysis of genetic variation in the redheaded pine sawfly (<em>N. lecontei</em>)<em> </em>provides information relevant to the management of this destructive pine pest. Most notably, although our work confirms that different <em>N. lecontei </em>populations should be considered the same species, we discovered drastically reduced genetic variation in a distinct northern population that makes northern <em>N. lecontei </em>populations particularly susceptible to local extinction. Second, this funding enabled us to produce genome assemblies and laboratory lines of pine sawflies that are being used by other research groups to study a wide range of topics, including: eye development, DNA methylation, immune function, and the genetic basis of sex determination. Third, this project provided valuable training opportunities for three postdocs (two women, one first-generation college graduate), four graduate students (three women, two first-generation college graduates), and 24 undergraduates (15 women, 7 students from at-risk Appalachian communities, 4 underrepresented minorities). Fourth, because speciation via host adaptation is an intuitive process and pine sawflies are a part of the local fauna, this research is very useful for conveying basic evolutionary principles and increasing public understanding of science. Through this grant, we developed evolution teaching modules that we adapted to diverse educational situations, including: a local high school (155 student participants; Fig. 4), a &ldquo;biology for non-majors&rdquo; course for undergraduates (4 semesters, ~360 students, many of whom are teaching majors), and a public outreach event (BioBonanza, ~450 visitors of all ages; Fig. 5).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/07/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Catherine&nbsp;R&nbsp;Linnen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257739/1257739_10233187_1502119575280_NleconteiStructure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257739/1257739_10233187_1502119575280_NleconteiStructure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1.
