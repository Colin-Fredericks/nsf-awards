 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of synthetic biology aims to utilize rapid developments in biotechnology to engineer synthetic biological systems for useful purposes, and in doing so, increases our understanding of the natural world. Researchers in the field are working to produce living technologies that manipulate information, fabricate materials, process chemicals, provide food, maintain health, and produce energy. The Synthetic Biology conference series (SB6.0) is the preeminent academic meeting in the field of Synthetic Biology and has hosted over 2,200 attendees from 31 countries since its inception as SB1.0 in 2004. The 6th installment of the conference series (SB6.0) will be held July 9-11, 2013 on the campus of Imperial College London, U.K. and will build on the successes of previous meetings hosted at MIT (SB1.0), University of California, Berkeley (SB2.0), Eidegenoesische Technische Hochschule (ETH), Zuerich (SB3.0), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (SB4.0), and Stanford University (SB5.0).\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nHeld over a three-day period in locations around the globe, the SB6.0 Conferences brings together the world's leading researchers, students, industry executives, and policy makers working to: (1) Design and build biological parts, devices, and integrated systems; (2)Develop biotechnologies and technical standards that enable such work; (3)Place this scientific and engineering research within its current and future social context,including biosafety/security, bioethics, education, and intellectual property.\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\nHeld every 2 years, the SB6.0 Conferences are unprecedented opportunities for the field's practitioners and supporters worldwide to: (1) share research results; (2) make academic and industrial connections; (3) gain exposure and feedback from the scientific and industrial community; and (4) openly discuss the critical societal impacts of their work, as well as the policy and governance issues that impact genomic research and development more broadly. The conference organizers pay particular attention to balance in the choice of organizers, speakers and participants. Early career scientists are particularly encouraged to attend.",
