 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists from multiple disciplines, including wildlife biology, public health, veterinary parasitology and biomedical sciences, have compiled a wealth of data on the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases, with most studies focused on particular locations or single host-pathogen interactions. This wealth of data creates the opportunity to address a pressing need, namely to explore the patterns and drivers of infectious disease emergence in humans and natural ecosystems at global scales. This project will create a Research Coordination Network to bring together internationally recognized experts from ecology, conservation medicine, parasitology and computational sciences to quantify and explore the drivers of global scale patterns of pathogen biodiversity. Participants will work together to assemble data sets of unprecedented size, including information about disease occurrence in host species ranging from insects to humans. With help from experts in machine learning (artificial intelligence) and geographic information systems (GIS), they will work to build predictive models that can be used to understand the changing distributions of infectious diseases and identify future hotspots of novel disease emergence in humans and wildlife.\r\n\r\nEmerging infectious diseases, especially those that jump from wildlife to livestock and humans, threaten public health around the world. Using state of the art computational methods, the RCN will be able to answer critical questions such as: How and why do certain pathogens successfully move from one host species to another? Are hotspots of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife the same areas as hotspots of disease emergence in humans and livestock? To share its findings, the RCN will develop educational products such as webcasts and workshops aimed at educational levels from high school to post graduate, and will train students from under-represented groups through a summer research program. The RCN will also develop and maintain databases of global infectious disease biodiversity and make these data freely available to the academic community and the general public.",

Overall the network included participants from six countries and 24 universities\n\nWe addressed questions of great interest both from the perspective of basic science, and of critical concern to human health.  For example, one of the most pressing concerns for society is predicting  which pathogens and disease events have the potential to cause a global pandemics.  We have approached this basic question from two different perspectives. One study looked at the factors that determine the overall geographic range of pathogens and parasites, investigating how the the characteristics of disease causing organisms that remain confined to small regions differ from those that become globally distributed.  A key finding is that pathogens that can infect a wider variety of host species, particularly a large number of close evolutionary relatives, tend to be the ones with larger geographic ranges.  Another study characterized how the driver and pathogen profile of a typical outbreak, which in modern times generally consists of 40 or fewer cases, differs from that of a large outbreak with thousands to hundreds of thousands of cases.  We found that large outbreaks are caused more often by viral than bacterial pathogens, and that the drivers of large outbreaks tend to be broad-scale factor such as contamination of water supplies, unusual weather conditions, poor sewage management, and population explosions in insect vectors such as mosquitos.   \n\nOther topics we investigated included how to most accurately map global patterns of biodiversity in parasitic organisms, new methodological approaches that can be used to better characterize host-parasite networks despite highly incomplete and spatially biased data, how direct ecological interactions such as predation have affected global patterns of parasite sharing among host species, and what future hotspots of zoonotic disease risk may appear due to the influence of climate change.
