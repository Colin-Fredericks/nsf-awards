 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to create a virtual laboratory for hardware security lab exercises. The lab exercises are based on a hands-on 'hardware hacking' course where students can work on specialized hardware to try out various hardware-based attacks. These lab activities include modules on side channel power analysis attacks, electromagnetic keyboard logging, counterfeit integrated circuit detection, and hardware Trojan attacks. Since the hardware lab components that enable these lab modules can be very expensive, it may be difficult to incorporate these labs in smaller universities and colleges. The virtual laboratory allows students from other institutions to remotely use the hardware in the University of Connecticut lab through a secure online website. The project has a significant impact on cybersecurity education by enabling the offering of hardware security curricula at a broader range of institutions through the use of virtual laboratories. The virtual labs allow multiple institutions to share hardware resources available at the University of Connecticut and use them in their own hardware security classes. Hardware security is a field of growing importance but there are no programs available to train students in this area. The virtual laboratory encourages programs at more institutions and thus increases the pool of professionals trained in hardware security. The results of this research are being disseminated in journals and conferences. The virtual lab framework and modules as well as results of evaluations, project assessment, and student learning outcomes are provided on the www.trust-hub.org website.",
