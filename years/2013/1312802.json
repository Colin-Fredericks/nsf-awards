EOVSA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer array, located at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), and is under construction for completion in 2013. EOVSA will provide the community open access to the most comprehensive, physics-based radio spectral measurements of solar and space-weather phenomena to date, together with a strong program of night-time science.\r\n\r\nEOVSA opens a new era in astrophysics research, while providing a stepping stone to the future Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR). As a university-based, solar-dedicated instrument, the array provides opportunities for young scientists and engineers to obtain hands-on experience in constructing and operating hardware, which when combined with traditional data analysis skills creates better, more capable researchers.",
