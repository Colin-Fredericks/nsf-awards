 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\nWith support from the Division of Materials Research, a collaboration between the Wide-Bandgaps group at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the Quantum Optics group at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, has been established to explore the feasibility of using non-centrosymmetric wide bandgap semiconductors as nonlinear optical materials. In this work, AlGaN (aluminum gallium nitride) will serve as a model material for the investigation of the applicability of this semiconductor class as the high-quality quasi phase-matched structures for second harmonic generation (SHG). As a wide bandgap semiconductor, this will allow for SHG to shift the wavelength of available semiconductor lasers to the range of shorter wavelengths, where injection lasers are not available. In principle, it should allow for the frequency doubling of the output of a semiconductor laser with the shortest wavelength in the violet-blue region and produce a compact, coherent deep ultraviolet light source with wavelengths approaching 200 nm. This international collaboration seeks to demonstrate quasi-phase matched structures for SHG based on wide bandgap nitrides and to develop fundamental nonlinear optical concepts for efficient SHG in the UV spectrum that cannot be achieved in other systems. In order to realize this, two main challenges need to be met: (1) the demonstration of periodic lateral polarity control in AlGaN alloys, and (2) the development of the basic understanding of nonlinear optical characteristics of these structures. The group at NCSU addresses the first challenge, where their expertise in growth and control of polarity in III-nitrides has been demonstrated. The Quantum Optics group at the University of Ljubljana addresses the second challenge with their unique capabilities and expertise in harnessing non-linear optical properties of different materials. The periodic AlGaN structures are grown and fabricated using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, with the choice of alloy composition and structure geometry based on the optical research by the group at Ljubljana. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\nNonlinear optical devices based on the aluminum gallium nitride semiconductors can provide a broad-based vehicle for laser light generation in the deep ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is not accessible by any other solid-state technology. This can find uses in health care, bio-defense and other commercial and defense applications. The use of light sources in the deep UV will lead to detection systems of different chemical and biological aerosols, providing for detection of a variety of pollutant agents among other effluents. In general, this research will lead to materials that will be used for applications that deal with the preservation and extension of natural resources by: (1) allowing for the efficient use and transmission of electrical energy, (2) availability of clean potable water through disinfection by the use of UV light emitting diodes, and (3) emissions and other effluents detection. In addition, this challenging project will provide the opportunity to establish a research collaboration and student exchange between North Carolina State University and the University of Ljubljana. This opportunity will also help expose the students and researchers to state of the art facilities within NCSU and the University of Ljubljana for realizing this research, while at the same time building an international network for establishing future careers.",

AlGaN based UV laser diodes, still face challenges in doping, carrier injection and defect control. Alternatively, deep UV lasers can be obtained by frequency doubling via second harmonic generation (SHG). AlN is an excellent candidate for the generation of UV-C laser light via SHG due to its large second order nonlinear susceptibility coefficient along the c-axis (7.7&nbsp;pm/V), superior to that of currently employed nonlinear crystals, like &beta;-BaB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>(1.84 pm/V). Its high thermal conductivity (320 W/m*K) and wide transparency window ( &gt; 205 nm) allows for a high power damage threshold and wide spectral tunability. SHG using the quasi-phase matching (QPM) technique, where the nonlinear coefficient of non-centrosymmetric crystals is periodically modulated, is effectively the most efficient phase matching technique and allows the use weakly birefringent materials with otherwise excellent nonlinear properties, such as AlN. On a broader scale, periodic and aperiodic QPM structures, offer the widest range of accessible nonlinear optical processes, widely exploited in optical communications and integrated optics. This technique had been limited, due to difficulties in fabricating periodically inverted nonlinear crystals with periods in the order of micrometers and in achieving high quality interfaces between the inverted domains.</p>\n<p>As a result of this project, a polarity control process is developed for III- and N-polar GaN and AlN thin films deposited on sapphire substrates via metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The surface morphologies for the respective polar films are characterized via AFM, where step flow growth is observed for both III-polar III-Nitrides and a rough surface is measured for both N-polar AlN and GaN. Using this polarity control process and by patterning a low temperature AlN nucleation layer using masked photolithography, 10&nbsp;&micro;m periodic AlN and GaN LPS are fabricated, where both polarities are grown simultaneously side by side. Through implementing laser interference lithography to pattern the low temperature AlN nucleation layer, long-range, sub-micrometer periodically poled AlN as well as GaN LPS are achieved. Uniform Al-polar growth of AlN is obtained in the regions where an AlN nucleation layer remained and predominantly N-polar growth is achieved in the areas where the sapphire surface is exposed. Under growth conditions where the Al vapor supersaturation is high, the N-polar surface roughness is large, leading to high scattering losses and inhibiting the propagation of light in AlN LPS-based waveguides. In the scope of this project, the surface roughness at the N-polar domains was successfully reduced by promoting step flow growth. This is achieved through reducing the Al vapor supersaturation below a critical surface supersaturation.</p>\n<p>In analogy to AlN, the GaN polarity control process scheme, utilizes a patterned low temperature AlN nucleation layer. Here also, a smooth surface of the N-polar GaN films is achieved by inducing step flow growth through control of the Ga vapor supersaturation. GaN LPS with 10&nbsp;&micro;m and 1.2&nbsp;&micro;m periodicities are also demonstrated. The 3.47&nbsp;eV bandgap value of GaN does not allow for frequency conversion into the UV-C spectral range. While there are numerous other interesting nonlinear applications using GaN QPM structures, it is beyond the scope of this work.</p>\n<p>As a final outcome, the group at Ljubljana demonstrated modal dispersion phase matched second harmonic generation down to 305 nm in single polar AlN waveguides, in agreement with theoretical calculations. In addition, the group achieved the first demonstration of quasi-phase matching in AlN with second harmonic generation down to 344 nm in polar waveguides. These demonstrations were based on the waveguides fabricated at NCSU, showing the feasibility to employ AlN for UV-C laser light generation. Immediate future work is focused on further processing improvements to show efficient conversion at wavelengths below 300 nm.</p>\n<p>As part of the broader impacts, the program has directly sponsored three graduate students and one post-doctoral associate.
