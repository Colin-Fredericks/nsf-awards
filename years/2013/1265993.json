 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Adam S. Veige of the University of Florida to explore the use of trianionic pincer-supported transition metal catalysts for the production of value-added materials.  This research is conducted in three parts.  The first objective is to develop tungsten and molybdenum complexes using unique three-coordinated pincer ligands for alkyne metathesis - an organic reaction involving the redistribution of alkyne (triple) bonds.  The trianionic ligand fuses three negatively-charged (anionic) donor groups to the meridional coordination plane, thus enabling access to  highly-reactive, coordinatively and electronically unsaturated metal complexes.   The second objective capitalizes on the preliminary discovery of highly-active substituted alkyne polymerization catalysts.  Experiments elucidate the catalyst's role in the polymerization reaction, providing insight into the creation of new, more active versions of the catalyst.  The third objective includes the development of catalysts capable of converting polyolefin waste into usable products.  This project focuses on elucidating the rare, but fundamental beta-alkyl elimination reaction. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, the global demand for catalyst manufacturing reached $30 billion.  These catalysts produced more than $10 trillion in goods and services annually.  Catalyst development, such as that explored in this research project, broadens scientific knowledge and presents opportunities for discovering new catalysts and catalytic reactions.  The underlying theme is to transform commodity or feedstock reagents into high-value products using non-precious metals to speed-up the reactions.  Student scientists in the Veige research group receive hands-on training in modern inorganic/organometallic chemistry to meet the demands of an increasingly specialized technological workplace.  In addition, interactive and entertaining events such as the Chemistry Day at the Oaks Mall are designed to raise public awareness and to inspire the next generation of scientists and their parents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNew Catalysts for Cyclic Polymer Synthesis\n\nWe report the primary objective of this project was achieved; to elucidate the mechanism and confirm the unprecedented production of cyclic polyenes from alkynes. The synthesis of cyclic polymers is a growing area of interest due to the potential differences in physical properties caused by lack of chain ends. Substrate scope and inefficient synthetic methods limit both the small-scale exploration of cyclic polymers and their large-scale commercial utility. Cyclic poly(phenylacetylene), an unprecedented cyclic polymer, is now accessible in high yield from the polymerization of inexpensive phenylacetylene. Over the project period we discovered a more efficient synthesis of a catalyst and confirmed the presence of cyclic polymers. A combined multi-faceted approach provided unambiguous evidence of a cyclic topology as compared to authentic linear samples. For the first time, we are now able to polymerize almost any terminal alkyne to give the corresponding cyclic polyene.\n\n \n\n Another discovery over the project period was the elucidation of an \"inorganic enamine\".  The concept involves creating highly nucleophilic metal-carbon multiple bonds. The concept can be extended to the creation of catalysts capable of activating small molecules such as carbon dioxide and ring expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP) to create cyclic polymers. We discovered a catalyst in which cyclic alkenes add to a metal-carbon triple bond to provide a tethered alkylidene capable of producing cyclic polymers. The significance is that this unprecedented reactivity can open new areas of catalyst design featuring metal-carbon multiple bonds that was previously overlooked.\n\n \n\nExploiting the idea of tethering an alkylidene to the ligand backbone within a metal complex provided another catalyst capable of producing cyclic polymers from norbornene via REMP, but in this case the cyclic polymers are stereoregular. The polymers contain &gt;95% cis double bonds and are &gt;95% syndiotactic.  \n\n \n\nCenter for Catalysis Chemistry Day at the Mall \n\nRaising public awareness of the chemical sciences and inspiring the next generation of chemists was the centerpiece of the educational outreach for CHE-1265993. The goal was to continue the long-term partnership between the PI, university students, and local businesses to increase the visibility and attractiveness of the chemical sciences to the public and future scientists. This educational outreach goal was executed through a Center for Catalysis Chemistry Day at the Mall (Figure 3). The event is an interactive, fun, and educational experience for students in grades K&ndash;12, local teachers, and parents. Now in its tenth year, this event continues to grow and by all accounts is a great success. In recent years approximately 400-500 children and their parents attend our event, casual onlookers number in the thousands.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam S Veige"
