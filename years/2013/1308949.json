 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has begun the development of an intriguing amplification alternative to PCR that could potentially be much simpler and more cost-effective. The PI's previous work on a free-radical \"amplification?by-polymerization\" approach demonstrated that it was possible to detect fewer than 2000 copies of DNA, with false positive and false negative rates comparable to PCR. This proposal seeks to extend this novel approach by using Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP), as a way to avoid the problems oxygen plays with free-radical polymerization and to combine ROMP with lateral flow assay as the basis of a new fieldable biosensor. The proposed research is transformative and has the potential and has the potential to become the basis of a field assay and have an impact in several biomedical sensing areas. These results will be used to improve the efficiency of using ROMP for amplifying the presence of target analytes and could serve as a first-line screening for, e.g., cytomegalovirus (CMV). The PI has an excellent record for training underrepresented minorities at all levels and this proposed work will add to that outreach effort. Her productivity under the previous CAREER is quite good with 16 publications and 21 conference talks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is without question that development of simple chemical sensing methods for users with no technical expertise and for in-field analysis outside of centralized analytical labs will have significant impacts for many chemical, biological and environmental applications.  The benefits of portable sensing and its cost efficiency are greatly appreciated in medical screening when doctors are able to provide early diagnosis and inexpensive routine testing to patients.  Similarly, first-line defense to chemical and biological warfare agents calls for enabling technologies capable of conducting field testing in areas of the world where technology infrastructure is limited.  Food safety and environmental regulation also demands on-site, real time detection of specific classes of molecules.  \n\nDuring this grant period we have demonstrated an innovative signal amplification method based on a facile Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) reaction.  In particular, instead of relying on DNA polymerase to enrich target molecules, we used a synthetic chemical reaction to enhance detection signals where polymer growth was used as a means to augment the occurrence of biomolecular recognition events, i.e. Amplification&ndash;by-Polymerization. Our results showed the feasibility of ROMP-based reactions as a more field friendly, more efficient, and more powerful approach in enhancing DNA binding signals.  We have also examined the use of RAFT grafting in an air-insensitive environment where poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) was formed with high efficiency.  Coupling the Amplification&ndash;by-Polymerization approach and the LF assay format was demonstrated to simplify sensing setups with potentials for reduced assay cost and operating complexity.  The employment of pre-formed polymers (polythiophene) in DNA sensing provided an alternative for the targeted DNA hand-held sensors.  A systematic study to understand the effects of polymer structure and conformation on sensing efficiency was carried out.  Most of our studies have focused on understanding the fundamental reaction mechanisms behind and improving sensing specificity and selectivity. \n\nBroader Impact:  Our supported work laid foundation for the development an air/moisture-tolerant and highly efficient chemical means for sensitive and selective DNA detection in a portable format, which may open up exciting opportunities for biomedical, chemical, and environmental applications where first-response detection and screening is needed.  Beyond sensing, the systematic investigation to understand the basic chemistry behind ROMP grafting in a biomolecule-friendly environment also provided insights on preparation of advanced functional materials and thin films for other applications.  The highly interdisciplinary nature of this project (polymer synthesis, surface characterization, and bioassay development, etc.) provided 3 PhD students opportunities to broaden their scope of training through interdisciplinary research and collaboration.  We also have recruited an undergraduate student and a high school student to work on different aspects of the project.  Two of five students involved were women students. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edmond F Bowden"
