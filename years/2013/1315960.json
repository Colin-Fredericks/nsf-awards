 "awd_abstract_narration": "1315960 (Guy). This symposium will bring together the most innovative practices in design, education and research for current and future reuse and recycling of material resources in the building environment. The primary audience will be researchers, educators, practitioners and advanced university students. The symposium will take place April 11-13, 2013 at The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.   Resources used in the building environment result in large quantities of extraction and processing waste, pollution and energy-use, and in the current paradigm are in turn typically wasted in equally large quantities in the processes of renovation and demolition. This symposium will convene educators and researchers in architecture and engineering programs for presentations, discussions, formation of collaborative networks, and the production of knowledge in the form of a proceeding and a book as a resource for educators, students and researchers. Symposium sessions will be dedicated to pedagogy for resourceful design theory and processes. Under-represented groups will be encouraged to participate via the offer of scholarships based on need and diversity. A sign language interpreter will be provided for all keynote presentations.  It is the intent to involve universities from across the USA and internationally in developing partnerships for future research and development of education knowledge infrastructure. The symposium information will be disseminated via a website, an electronic proceeding and a book. The book will be a resource for faculty and students interested in these topics as well as community based or government agencies involved in policies for environmental protection and community development.",

The event had 133 registrants representing eight countries including the US. The countries represented were: the USA, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands and Turkey. In addition, there were twenty-seven universities in the US and internationally represented at the event. There were four keynote talks and thirty-nine presentations of an equal number of papers. \n \nThis award supported conduct of the  symposium and the subsequent compilation of expanded papers from the \u00e6best of\u00c6 presentations for publication as an edited book. In addition, the conference proceeding will be provided to 200 members of the Architectural Research Centers Consortium (ARCC) and summarized to the joint European Association for Architectural Education (EAAE) and ARCC,  EAAE-ARCC 2014 International Architectural Research Conference at the University of Hawaii, February 12-15, 2014. \nIntellectual Merit\nThe resources used in the built environment result in large quantities of extraction and processing waste, pollution and energy-use, and in the current paradigm are typically wasted in large quantities in the processes of renovation and demolition. Reuse extends the life of an object for continued functional service past its first use. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has established the hierarchy of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and considers reuse to be a form of source reduction, preferable to recycling or other forms of waste management. \n \nThe causes of these building-related wastes and the lack of standardized design and construction systems for the incorporation of reclaimed materials into new construction are attributable to the architects and engineers who are responsible for the creation of the built environment. In turn, each generation of built environment professionals has the capacity to evolve these systems. There are few to none symposiums that provide the opportunity for academics and researchers who are focused specifically on the recovery and reuse of built environmental resources as the foundations for teaching and scholarship in architecture and engineering schools. In addition, it is important to provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student researchers to present their work in a collegial environment with their peers and faculty. This symposium addressed these issues by convening educators, researchers, and students in architecture and engineering programs for presentations, discussions, formation of collaborative networks, and the production of knowledge in the form of a proceeding and a book as a resource for educators, students and researchers.  \nThe event brought together an international representation that stimulated exchanges around the different conditions that exist for addressing waste in the built environment, and the approaches that are taken in these contexts. This symposium was transformative because of its uniqueness in fulfilling a need to convene educators and researchers involved in teaching future designers of the built environment through the lenses of material waste prevention, reuse and recycling. This symposium was resourced through academic-year efforts of the P.I. with graduate research assistant support and by the facilities of the Edward M. Crough Center for Architectural Studies at The Catholic University of America. Due to the success of this symposium, the Center for Building Stewardship at CUArch plans to host the next R+R symposium in Spring, 2015.\n \nBroader Impacts\nThis symposium promoted teaching and..."
