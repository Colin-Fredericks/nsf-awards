 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued advancement of computing is of critical importance given the ubiquitous use of computing systems in various forms across a growing landscape-from implantable and wearable biomedical devices to facilitate personalized healthcare; to embedded and smart-sensor devices to facilitate efficient transportation and civil infrastructure; to cloud servers to facilitate data collection, mining, modeling and discovery; to many other scientific, economic, and social computing applications touching numerous disciplines and sectors. Unrelenting progress in semiconductor technologies and continual emergence of new application areas spur unprecedented development of many-core chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to satisfy increasing performance expectations and tightening power and resource constraints of future systems. Along with this parallel processing paradigm comes many challenges for efficiently interconnecting tens to hundreds of cores on a chip and possibly many thousands of chips in stand-alone or distributed systems. To meet the challenges, on-chip network (or NoC) communication architectures must be developed that provide scalable performance while both requiring minimal resources and consuming ultra-low power.\r\n \r\nThis research investigates cross-cutting approaches and techniques to enhance on-chip network power, performance, and resource efficiency in CMP systems. Architecture-level support is explored for effectively exploiting circuit-level power-gating techniques. The objective is to maximize static power savings and minimize performance penalty of the NoC while conserving overall system dynamic power and energy expenditure when applying the techniques.  Innovative approaches for minimizing NoC resources and enabling flexibility in resource utilization are also explored. The objective is to improve NoC resource efficiency while balancing system-level tradeoffs.  The research plan establishes a systematic, comprehensive, and empirically-based method of investigating efficient communication architectures for many-core CMP systems, soundly grounded by theoretical support, that will lead to the design of promising new approaches and techniques. Beyond its contribution to fundamental advancements in computing, this research has broader potential impact to society through its outreach activities to broaden participation in computing and workforce development of persons from diverse backgrounds.",

Further extension of this work was to investigate sharing of on-chip resources in chip multiprocessors (CMPs) more broadly, including last-level caches and off-chip memory bandwidth in addition to the on-chip network.\n\nThere are a number of specific outcomes of this research, three of which are the following.  One significant outcome is an elegant technique that was proposed, called node-router decoupling or NoRD, that non-trivially provides bypass paths for enabling network connectivity to be maintained while routers are powered down or transitioning between powered-on/off states. Another specific outcome is a novel core-state-aware NoC power-gating scheme, called Smart Butterfly, based on flattened butterfly network topologies, that is designed to utilize active/sleep state information of processing cores to improve NoC power-gating effectiveness.  Yet another specific outcome is an efficient technique, called Power Punch, applicable to mesh topologies in which near non-blocking power-gating of NoC routers is achieved by generating and transmitting power control signals sufficiently early so as to \"punch through\" the network ahead of packets which acts to power up needed routers along the path of packets without incurring costly router wakeup latency that would otherwise sacrifice performance. \n\nAchieving the research goal and outcomes was premised on the following notion: that low-power and resource-efficient NoCs are possible when a minimal resource set for maintaining correct operation can be found such that resources are dynamically powered on and off, as needed, via effective use of power-gating techniques to uphold performance requirements.
