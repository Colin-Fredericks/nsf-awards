 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principal investigators and evaluators of grants funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program have identified a need for access to valid, reliable, useful, and accessible, real-time evaluative data for decision making in their projects and centers.  However, limits on time, expertise, and resources have meant that this need often remains unmet.  This project conducts webinars and other activities in preparation for holding a one day workshop to solicit input to create an evaluation logic model, identify data priorities, and identify criteria for development of tools to support formative assessment/evaluation of ATE projects and centers.  Participants in the workshop process explore and document evaluation ideas, designs, and systems that can enable all ATE projects and centers to make the most effective use of evaluation. The project is guided by international experts in formative evaluation.\r\n\r\nTogether with representative PIs, the project leadership plans webinars on logic models and formative evaluation.  The outcomes are possible logic models to be refined by input from a larger group of PIs at the workshop.  Having PI input into developing the logic models ensures their use.  The outputs are posted on the Evalu-ate website and advertised in other publications.  The Advisory Panel members actively review project plans, web and workshop plans, and outcomes.   Feedback from the Advisory Panel and participants groups is used to inform and guide the determination of product emphases and judgments regarding the value of the project itself. \r\n\r\nThe project provides models to change project and center evaluations from annual summative evaluation to ongoing formative evaluations that provide practical and timely information to guide the development of the project.   The products should be useful in other NSF program as well.",

In the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, typically that expectation is fulfilled by annual summative evaluation reporting. The core principle of the Formative Assessment Systems for Advanced Technological Education (FAS4ATE) worskshop project, based on the stated needs of Principal Investigators (PIs) and evaluators involved in the ATE program, was that the assessment of success annually, or at the completion of a grant cycle, is not sufficient. Ongoing access to valid, reliable, useful, and accessible, real-time evaluative data for decision making is needed to ensure that ATE funded efforts achieve the best possible results with their funds. However, those same ATE PIs and evaluators reported that limits on time, expertise, and resources have meant that this need often remains unmet. FAS4ATE workshop project, led by The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University and The Centre for Program Evaluation at University of Melbourne, Australia, addressed these needs by creating an international, multi-disciplinary space where experts on formative assessment and evaluation interacted with ATE PIs and evaluators to bring best practices in evaluation into the ATE program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project Summary</p>\n<p>FAS4ATE was designed as the first phase (Figure 1) of a process to address this need for real time data, by learning about the typical program designs and formative data needs in projects.

We conducted two 1.5 hour pre-workshop preparatory webinars (with 85 and 52 participants, respectively) and a one day workshop (with 28 participants from more than 20 ATE projects and centers).
