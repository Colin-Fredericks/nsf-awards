 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a global numerical model of the electromagnetic fields produced by ionospheric electromagnetic currents with the research goal of enabling better prediction of the impact of space weather on the electric power grid.  The methodology involves finite-difference time domain (FDTD) computational solutions of the full-vector three-dimensional time-dependent Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic wave propagation within the global Earth-ionosphere system.  In particular, the atmosphere-lithosphere volume between 400 km above the Earth's surface to 400 km below will be studied in unprecedented detail at high spatial resolutions.  The research will build on previous and current work in this area by using Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) data and by establishing collaborations with the Electric Power Research Institute SUNBURST monitoring network project.   The model will simulate the effects of ionospheric currents that develop as the result of coronal mass ejections in order to improve our understanding of the resultant electrodynamics.  The fine spatial resolution of the newly computed FDTD solutions will provide improved information for assessing and mitigating potential hazards specific to the operations of inland and coastal power grids and oil pipelines.  One education goal is to develop a sequence of three computational electromagnetic courses at the University of New Mexico.  A second goal is to initiate and establish a Residential College system at the University of New Mexico.",

The largest documented geomagnetic storm on Earth resulting from a CME on the sun occurred in 1859.  That storm caused telegraph operators communicating over 100-km-long wire lines to experience electric shocks, some nearly fatal.  Further, business transactions requiring telegraphic exchanges were completely shut down in the world\u00c6s major capitals. \n\nA 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space weather events, \"though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future.\"  However, a re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather storm could disrupt today\u00c6s society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies.  Interruptions to radio communications, commercial airline flight plans, satellite operations, transportation, banking, financial systems, home and industrial computer electronics, and electric power grids are just some examples.
