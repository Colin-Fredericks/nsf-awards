 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to explore the feasibility of novel family of microwave and millimeter wave devices using hot carrier transport in MoS2 and related compounds. The band structure of MoS2 has should enable Negative Differential Resistance instability. Since MoS2 can be cheaply produced in large area sheets, this new technology could have key advantages for wireless sensing biomedical, homeland security, and \"Internet of Things,\" applications. It is high-payoff and transformative because, if successful, it will enable a whole new generation of layered-to-bulk microwave and millimeter wave \"beyond graphene\" sources, detectors, and sensors, at a fraction of the cost of existing components. \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is in understanding of hot carrier transport in materials \"beyond graphene\", and in developing novel principles of operation for layered ambipolar devices for photonic and electro-optic applications.\r\nThe broader impact of the project will be in gaining understanding of new fundamental physics of hot carrier and ambipolar \"beyond graphene\" nanostructures, enabling the development of novel microwave and millimeter wave devices on large scale at a fraction of the cost of existing devices; in enabling sensing applications at a large scale, in developing new approaches for applications of a large variety of \"beyond graphene\" materials, in seeding the \"beyond graphene\" electronics industry; in creating new high-tech American jobs, and in training the next generation of scientists and engineers through \"beyond graphene\" related new curriculum and outreach at all levels - from K to 12 to post graduate education.",
