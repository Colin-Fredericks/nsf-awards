 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Irvine Valley College (IVC) Photonics Initiative is developing technician-level professionals with the skills required to earn gainful employment designing and building devices that interact with light. These optics and photonics jobs are essential to our nation's economic and technical competitiveness. This Initiative is combining OP-TEC's proven fundamental optics and photonics courses with an electronics core curriculum to create a hands-on, two-year Photonics Technology program.  Reaching out to youth, veterans, and non-traditional students, this project increases awareness of careers in photonics through coursework, experiential learning, and internships that lead directly to employment. IVC is establishing itself as the West Coast leader among OP-TEC's network of Partner Colleges. The IVC Photonics Initiative supports regional optics and photonics companies and encourages others to locate in the Western United States. Current employees are acquiring competitive technical skills that allow them to improve job performance and increase career opportunities. This responsive, photonics-based collaborative creates a pipeline between IVC and regional high schools, industries, and universities. IVC's Photonics Initiative prepares graduates with STEM knowledge and skills that cross multiple industries, lead to innovative applications in advanced technologies, and contribute to an innovative and vibrant national economy.",
