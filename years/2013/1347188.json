 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1347188 \r\nPI: Bejan \r\n\r\nThis EAGER proposal is an exploratory approach to applying principles of the Constructal Law to problems in heat transfer and energy. Using heat network distribution analysis the proposal will seek to define the allocation of one heat/energy flow system to another within the same confined space.  How power/energy is distributed in an evolving system is an important question that will be addressed.  The PI plans to develop designs of distributed energy systems to achieve the outlined objectives of the proposal by demonstrating the proper allocation of the nodes of energy consumption and area elements on the landscape through consideration of the heating needs of a population.  Such analyses could lead to fundamental answers of heat/power distribution networks such as when central heating becomes more competitive than individual heating.  Additionally, the merits of other tree-shaped architectures will be examined.  The thermal network analysis will be first examined in detailed by performing analyses in the steady state. \r\n\r\nThe holistic view of flow architecture based on the thermal network simulation experiments to be performed in this work for high-density living is essential for expediting the fuel-efficient design of urban areas going forward.  Importantly, this work will help discover methods in sustainable design such that the minimal amount of fuel is consumed to meet the needs of sustaining life and progress of society.  Finally, the methods proposed shall also investigate the construction of a physics framework in which design of energy flow and water flow are of one design, to meet the challenge of conserving water resources that are heavily consumed in the energy production process.  Like the energy networks, the work will be a combination of theoretical guidelines and numerous numerical simulations of competing flow architectures to look for optimal solutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main outcome of this project is that the concept of design for sustainability was clarified and defined in physics terms, which makes sustainability an integral part of modern thermodynamics.  In brief, the project showed that \"water\" and \"energy\" are one flow architecture on the globe, and sustainability is the natural evolution of this architecture such that it flows more efficiently, for greater access over time.  All these flows are driven by power from natural and human designs.  The power is spent in order to drive these flows.  Sustainability, or survival, is synonymous with power generated and spent for the purpose of sustaining movement.  This natural design covers the board, from inanimate flows systems (e.g., river basins) to animate flow systems (e.g., animals, humans, technology).  One manifestation of this natural tendency in the human realm is that the wealth of a group is proportional to the fuel spent with purpose by that group.  These findings are in accord with the law of physics that governs evolution in nature:  the constructal law.  The international community of scholars that was attracted to this project was at the center of the 9th Constructal Law &amp; Second Law Conference, which took place in Parma, Italy on 18-19 May 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian Bejan"
