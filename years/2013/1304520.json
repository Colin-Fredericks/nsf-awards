Ivy Tech and the Purdue University College of Technology (CoT) collaborate to develop a technology-based logistics program designed to meet the growing demands of Indiana's employers.  Four primary objectives include: 1) informing  Indiana high school and middle school students and Career and Technology Education teachers about educational and career opportunities in the field of logistics; 2) developing industry-driven logistics curricula for Ivy Tech and the CoT at Purdue University; 3) developing smooth student transfer between the Associate's degree programs in logistics at Ivy Tech and the Bachelor's degree programs at the CoT at Purdue; and 4) to implement an outreach and recruitment program to encourage Ivy Tech's Associate's degree students to continue their education through to a Bachelor's degree.  The project works with industry, the ATE National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education (NCSCTE).  The evaluation includes qualitative and quantitative measures of student success.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Indiana CrossRoads Logistics Project has been successful in launching a new curriculum across the state intended to create interest in a growing career field.  With the project team and instructors, the project's objectives were achieved to create a sustainable curriculum design.  The project created interest in the field among high school students and increased participation in the field at the community college level, boding well for increased hiring at the entry-level across Indiana.  The streamlined curriculum and consistent formative assessments enabled the project ot obtain high Manufacturing Skills Standards Council Certified Logistics Associate national certification exam pass rates and create a statewide curriculum that will be sustained past the grant period.  The project has provided exposure in the supply chain management and logistics career paths to more than 4,000 students across Indiana between K-12 and post-secondary, and initiated new ways to make the needs of business more accessible to and visible in the school systems.  This was accomplished through numerous visits to high schools and junior high schools, as well as events hosted on campuses and the statewide Logistics Summits hosted by the Indiana Logistics Council.\n\n \n\nThe project also generated new learning activities (LAs) that enriched the logistics curriculum and can be incorporated into other courses at the high school level.  High school teachers were provided with classroom supplies to better incorporate activities into the curriculum.  There were also professional development activities for teachers both in face-to-face workshop format and in an online asynchronous format.\n\n \n\nAn external evaluation revealed that the faculty participants reported positive responses towards logistics curricula, and reported the increased ability to incorporate the newly acquired concepts into their curriculum.  They developed their own interpretations about how to best introduce logistics to students and they reported positive perceptions from students that arose from the LAs.  The students persisted in their work and noted their continued interest in the growing career option of logistics or supply chain management.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathryne A Newton"
