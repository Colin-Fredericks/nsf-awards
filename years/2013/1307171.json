 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of high-energy particle astrophysics has advanced significantly during the last decade as a result of discoveries made by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. These instruments have now detected very high-energy gamma-radiation (energies above 100 gigaelectronvolt (GeV)) from classes of objecting ranging from pulsars to blazars and starburst galaxies.  Detailed measurements of these sources probe the most energetic phenomena in the Universe.  The ground-based observatory VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in Arizona.  VERITAS has now reached a sensitivity level more than an order of magnitude better than the previous generation of instruments and, as a result of its recently completed upgrade, has now extended its sensitivity range to energies below 100 GeV.  VERITAS is producing a wealth of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award will support scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles working on VERITAS science and on the scientific projections for the next generation international ground-based gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA.)  UCLA has played a major role in the VERITAS construction, in the development of analysis and simulation software for the experiment, and in the production of the scientific results reported to date. With this award the UCLA group will focus on maintaining VERITAS, analyzing data, producing scientific results, and defining science goals for CTA. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The UCLA group supports the VERITAS Education and Public Outreach program, which it helped to develop. The program reaches local audiences at the Whipple Observatory Visitor's Center, museum audiences at the Adler Planetarium, and the general public through the VERITAS education web site. UCLA scientists conduct tours at the VERITAS site and help to provide materials for the public. VERITAS and CTA materials will be used for local activities at UCLA involving schools in the Los Angeles area. In addition, researchers at UCLA are involved in education and outreach efforts through public speaking, planetarium shows, and individual student mentorship.",

UCLA scientists made significant contributions to all aspects of VERITAS, including upkeep of telescope hardware, observing shifts, software and analysis development, and the production of scientific results.\n\nOne of the most significant studies carried out by UCLA scientists relates to the analysis of data taken by VERITAS from observations of the Cygnus region of our Galaxy.  VERITAS made over 300 hours of observations of Cygnus during a five year period.  UCLA researchers carried out the detailed analysis of the full Cygnus data set to produce an overall sky map of the region in very high energy gamma rays.

CTA is a large, worldwide effort involving scientists from 32 countries.  The project aims to build two large telescope arrays (one in each hemisphere) to study the same science as VERITAS but with ten times the sensitivity and much improved angular resolution.  Figure 2 shows an artist?s conception of one of the CTA arrays; three different sizes of telescopes can be seen: small (4 meters diameter), medium (9-12 meters diameter) and large (23 meters diameter).

These activities included tours of the VERITAS site in Arizona, public talks at schools and organizations in the Tucson and Los Angeles areas, participation in science fairs,  a general information booth on very high energy gamma rays at the major American Astronomical Society meeting, and strong involvement in Exploring Your Universe (EYU),  the major outreach event hosted on the UCLA campus each year that attracts more than 5,000 participants.
