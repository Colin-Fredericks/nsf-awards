The LANSCE neuton schools are intended to cover a particular science topic, for which neutron scattering has made or is expected to make a major impact. The 2013 and 2014 LANSCE Schools on Neutron Scattering will focus on Geosciences and Materials in Extreme Environments and Mesoscale Sciences and Interfaces, respectively. Each of the annual schools will run for 9-10 days and they consist of formal lectures and hands-on experiments, using the neutron scattering facilities at the LANSCE.\r\nThe main objectives of both school are: a) to provide in-depth neutron-scattering training in a particular topic (in particular, for graduate students in their early stage of thesis research), b) to attract new users to the neutron-scattering community, c) to increase diversity among expert neutron scatterers, and d) to broaden the field where neutron scattering can develop further. \r\nThe number of student participants is limited to ~30 students, selected from a large applicant pool using a variety of criteria. A particular emphasis is put on selecting a diverse student body in order to foster a cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary and multicultural learning environment. This grant will support travel and meals for accepted student participants.",

Unlike X-rays, neutrons are sensitive to light elements (for example, Hydrogen) and provide ample contrast between neighboring elements (e.g. Iron and Cobalt) in the periodic table. Moreover, neutrons carry a magnetic moment and they can also be used to test the arrangement of magnetic moments in a material. However, neutron scattering is a rather specialized technique and it requires the use of national user facilities, where a large neutron flux is produced either as a fission product in a research reactor or through spallation products at a spallation source. The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) operates one of the two neutron spallation sources in the US, the other being the world&rsquo;s premier spallation source, the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).</p>\n<p>The large through-put of neutron-scattering studies and the unique information gained in many research fields led to an increasing demand of trained neutron scatterers, therefore essentially all neutron-scattering user facilities worldwide introduced training programs specific to their facility.

The LANSCE Schools offered full support for participation to a limited number of about 30 graduate students, predominantly in the early stages of their research career.
