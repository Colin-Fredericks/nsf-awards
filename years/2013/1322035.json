 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle aim of this project is to document the timing and response of the southwestern Laurentian margin to the initiation of subduction during late Paleozoic time. Although the recycling of lithosphere at subduction zones is a fundamental part of plate tectonic theory, the manner by which subduction zones initiate is a poorly constrained process, largely because there are few modern examples and ancient examples are largely not recognized or well preserved. Unique sequences of sedimentary and volcanic rocks exposed in southern California (El Paso Mountains region) and northern Mexico (Carborca Block) will be investigated in order to better understand how subduction inception is recorded in stratigraphic successions and how the paleogeography of continental margins evolves in response to the onset of plate convergence. We propose that continental margin successions recording subduction initiation will have predictable deepening and shallowing trends and distinct changes in sand composition and detrital zircon provenance through time reflecting the changing paleogeography of source regions. An additional geochemical and geochronologic investigation of volcanic sequences and coeval intrusions will be used to constrain the timing and petrogenesis of magmatic products, which we suggest will record conditions unique to cold, nascent continental arc settings. Results of this project may contribute significantly to global models of the birth and development of subduction zones. This project is a multi-disciplinary and collaborative effort between researchers at California State University - Northridge and Northern Arizona University, which are both minority-serving institutions. In addition to the science goals of the project, this research will provide training and mentorship for masters level and undergraduate students and promote the involvement of underrepresented groups in STEM research. Sample collections and study results will be used for the development of resources for teaching, community outreach, and further research.",

This is because the onset of subduction does not get preserved well in the rock record and because modern analogs are few. A unique suite of Permian igneous and metasedimentary rocks, preserved in southern California and Sonora, Mexico, are thought to record the initiation of subduction along the southwestern margin of North America.

Datasets bearing on the timing and mode of formation of earliest arc magmatic products were also generated in order to assess the processes by which new continental arc systems are developed.\n\nNEW FINDINGS / INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Research done by PI Riggs and her students at Northern Arizona University primarily focused on the analysis of Permian sedimentary strata in Sonora, Mexico, with lesser focus on early arc magmatism in the Sierra Nevada of California.  \n\nIn Sonora, graduate student Stephen Dobbs documented a marine record in the Monos Formation of upsection deepening-and-shallowing, culminating in development of a carbonate reef complex.  Overall, this corresponds to the expected succession related to subduction initiation.  We were also able to constrain the earliest sedimentary record of magmatism to c. 266 Ma (Fig. 1), which, although younger than the age of earliest plutonism, may reflect evolution of volcanism as plutons remained unexposed.  We infer that asymmetry in the incipient arc meant that detritus remained on the forearc side until Early Triassic time. \n\nHf analysis of previously dated zircon grains in a middle Permian pluton indicates that magma composition was strongly influenced by continental crust.  Initial &epsilon;Hf values that average -7 indicate a highly evolved source; arc-derived zircon within the sedimentary strata similarly have initial &epsilon;Hf values that average -10 (Fig. 2).  We use these data to infer that the western margin of Laurentia experienced induced nucleation of subduction as the California-Cohuila fault yielded to compressional stresses, causing the proto-Pacific plate to begin subducting under continental Laurentian crust.\n\nIn the Sierra Nevada, we continue to unravel the complex Mesozoic history of roof pendants, as well as constraining the timing of earliest magmatism to c. 230 Ma in this part of the arc.  Earliest arc magmatism produced subaqueous dome fields represented by mafic breccias and caldera complexes whose products may extend across two or more pendants.\n\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Broader impacts center on research experiences for graduate students and work experience for undergraduates. The grant supported MS theses by Steve Dobbs (MS 2016; matriculated F16 to Stanford University) and Derek Field (MS 2017, now instructor at Cal Lutheran College).  Both students presented their research at Geological Society of America meetings; Dobbs is currently finishing a manuscript from his thesis.  Several undergraduate and graduate students were employed in the mineral-separation lab and as field assistants.   Students received training in field methods (sample collection, measuring stratigraphic sections, mapping) and in lab methods (mineral separation, U-Pb analysis).  Dobbs spent one week at California State University-Northridge working with co-PI Kathie Marsaglia, who also served as a member of this thesis committee.  CSUN graduate student Eric McDonald was funded by the grant to be Dobbs?s field assistant in Mexico.\n\nPartially as a result of this work, PI Riggs has been invited to be a keynote speaker at the GEOPANGEA conference to be held at the UNAM-Mexico City in January, 2019.  Riggs has also begun a collaboration with a UNAM-Hermosillo researcher to investigate late Permian sedimentary rocks in Baja California.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy R Riggs"
