 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research award is to determine how quasi-linear convective systems (squall lines) and supercell thunderstorms interact by modifying their local environments when the two are in close proximity. A combination of observational techniques and numerical simulations will be utilized to: 1) identify common changes to storm structure and intensity that occur as a result of the proximity between the two storm types, and 2) relate these changes to specific environmental perturbations induced by the storms themselves. To date there has been extensive study on the role that background environmental parameters such as instability and wind shear play in modulating convective storm organization and intensity, but it is unclear how storm-generated perturbations to these parameters may influence neighboring convective storms. This represents an important gap in the knowledge base as widespread severe weather outbreaks often see multiple storm types (e.g., squall lines and supercells) evolving in close proximity to one another. Improving our understanding of how these storms interact will provide forecasters with a better idea of what to expect when issuing short-term forecasts and severe weather warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: As the forecasting community seeks to improve severe weather warnings through new programs such as the Warn on Forecast Initiative, one of the key challenges to overcome is to improve the current understanding of local-scale environmental heterogeneity and its effect on severe thunderstorm evolution. The study will address this challenge by examining the role that localized, storm-induced perturbations to the environment play in modulating severe storm organization and intensity. The results of the work will be used to develop conceptual models to help forecasters understand and anticipate the effects of storm-induced environmental heterogeneity, despite not being able to observe these perturbations directly. Furthermore, much of what is known about convective storm dynamics comes from studies of thunderstorms or convective systems under comparatively \"well-behaved\" conditions. By investigating how multiple storms interact, the research will be significant as it will provide a test as to whether these generalized conceptual models apply when multiple storms are interacting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The \"big picture\" goal for this research project is to improve short-term severe weather forecasts by improving the understanding of how squall lines and supercell thunderstorms interact. This should lead to more accurate and specific severe weather warnings, and thus a more effective means of protecting life and property during severe weather outbreaks. The project will support two graduate students over the course of the project. In doing so, the project will further the integration of research and education, engaging the students and providing them with valuable first-hand research experience. Results will be disseminated through presentations at national and regional conferences as well as through peer-reviewed journal articles. Additionally, the PI plans to incorporate data and examples into his regular coursework at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was focused on improving our understanding of how nearby thunderstorms may interact with each other to alter storm structure and intensity.  Specifically, we sought to understand the scenario where a line of thunderstorms (a \"squall line\") is overtaking one or more discrete, intense supercell thunderstorms.  This type of scenario is often observed during outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, and supercells in particular are responsible for large portion of high-end damage associated with thunderstorms (strong winds, large hail, and significant tornadoes).  We set out two science objectives related to this issue:\n\n1) Examine the role that a nearby squall line plays in promoting changes in the structure or intensity of an isolated supercell located in the pre-line environment.\n\n2) Examine the role that a supercell may play in promoting 3-dimensional structures (bow echoes or meso-vortices) along a nearby squall line.\n\n Science objective 1 was addressed using a combination of observational analysis and numerical modeling.  Observational results indicated a decline in supercell intensity as the squall line approached, however there was considerable case-to-case variability in the magnitude of the decline.  Generally, longer-lived supercells experienced more noticeable weakening, while \"younger\" storms maintained their intensity. Low-level storm rotation generally weakened during the 30-60 minutes prior to the supercell merging with the squall line, followed by an increase during the 30 minutes immediately prior to the merger between the storms.  Modeling results largely confirmed the observations of the supercell weakening as the squall line approached.  This appears to be driven by a wave of sinking motion produced in response to the developing squall line.  In simulations where shading effects from clouds are included, the supercells were weakened the most, sometimes dissipating completely ahead of the squall line. \n\n We also produced a set of model simulations to test how the supercell responded to the changes to the local environmental profiles of wind, temperature and relative humidity as the squall line approached.  In general, changes to the winds were found to be small until just before the storms merged, and appeared to have little effect on the supercell.  The biggest effect on the temperature and humidity profiles were a moistening trend as the squall line approached, which favored  an increase in precipitation associated with the supercell.\n\n Science objective 2 was examined exclusively using numerical simulations.  Our study found that merely including a supercell ahead of a squall line, independent of its location, had little effect on the squall line until the cold outflows from the storms began to interact.  At this point, depending on the relative position of the storms, new mesovortices were sometimes observed to form where the outflows intersected.  Additional mesovortices, as well as swaths of strong winds, were also observed after the precipitation cores of the storms merged, although the number of vortices and extent of the strong winds varied depending on where along the line the supercell merged.  Following the merger between the storms, changes in the number and character of mesovortices were also observed well away from the merger location, implying that the interaction between the storms can be \"felt\" throughout the larger squall line.\n\n The project supported three graduate students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, one of which was from a traditionally underrepresented group in science and engineering. Two of these have successfully completed their degrees, one of which has since gone on to a position in the National Weather Service, while the third will be completing his program in spring 2019. All three played leading roles in their respective parts of the research project and presented their results at national conferences.  To date, this work has led to 11 conference presentations, including 5 presented at conferences that have an operational forecasting focus.    Final results are being prepared for publication with additional publications expected in the coming year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam J French"
