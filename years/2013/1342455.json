The main objective of the EAGER project is to characterize the hydrologic cycle over various landscape types by collecting water vapor isotopes from tower measurements as well as an aircraft. A fixed-wing aircraft has been modified to support the sensors necessary for the project. Contracting was expected to take place through NSF's arctic research support and logistics contractor but will instead be done by the awardee for approximately the same cost and with increased involvement of the PI.",
