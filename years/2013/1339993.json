 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) Robert Noyce Mathematics Teacher Scholarship Program is supporting thirty-six individuals in becoming highly-qualified teachers committed to teaching mathematics in high-need high schools in the Laredo, Texas area.  The project is increasing the collaboration between mathematics faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences and faculty in the College of Education, to ensure well-prepared teachers enter the workforce.  To support the effort, the project is adding an integrated course that combines mathematics content and teaching pedagogy preparation, all based on best practices research.  Scholars are being supported through Professional Development workshops, membership in the Texas Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and travel to an annual mathematics conference.  The scholars being awarded Noyce support are recruited both from students already enrolled at TAMIU and those graduating from Laredo Community College who are academically strong in mathematics and continuing their higher education at TAMIU.  To aid in recruiting talented students who might otherwise not consider a teaching career, thirty-six, one-month-long summer internships are offered to freshmen or sophomores at the place of their choosing.  These hands-on internships occur at the Laredo Community College Lamar Bruni Vergara Environmental Science Center or at the Imaginarium of South Texas.  Working with students on mathematics project in these informal settings is reinforcing participants' career choices.  The school districts partnering with TAMIU include the Laredo Independent School District and the United Independent School District.  To help address the sense of professional isolation that too often leads to lack of retention in newly hired teachers, the project is supporting scholars during the induction period both with face-to-face and virtual mentor that includes both an education faculty and a mathematics faculty member.",
