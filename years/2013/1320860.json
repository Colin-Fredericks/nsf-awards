 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely regarded as a\r\nrevolutionary innovation; however, traditional instructional\r\ntechniques do not scale to MOOCs with tens of thousands of students.\r\nThis project aims to design a set of algorithmic tools to partially\r\nautomate three of the most basic instructional processes - grading\r\nassignments, giving students personalized feedback, and creating new\r\nassignments - in MOOCs that teach computer programming. Such tools\r\nhave the potential to significantly raise the productivity of\r\ninstructors in these courses, and give students a far more effective\r\neducational experience than what they currently receive. They can also\r\nguide the development of future MOOCs on programming, and play a role\r\nin making the MOOC model reach its full potential.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms developed in this project draw on ideas from several\r\ndifferent areas of computing. They leverage advances in automated\r\nreasoning about software like automatically finding bugs in\r\nstudent code and suggesting fixes, and exploit statistical learning\r\ntechniques that mine databases of previously-completed assignments and\r\ninfer aggregate statistics about a class. Finally, the research has a\r\ndimension of human computation, for instance seeding logical and\r\nstatistical analysis techniques with data obtained through peer\r\nevaluation. These methods apply to any programming course; however,\r\nthe investigators will evaluate them by deploying them in a specific\r\nMOOC on Python programming that they teach.",
