 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of sensor and software middleware technologies to fill the security and performance limitations present in current biometric recognition systems.   The technologies have the following market-valued features: accurate detection of spoofing attempts in fingerprint, iris and face recognition, and sensor interoperability enhancements for biometric systems.  They will provide significant performance and security benefits when compared to the leading commercial systems currently available in the biometrics market.  The project accomplishes this transfer of research products to the market through the development of robust software, systems and processes.   The outcomes include creation of new high tech jobs in West Virginia?s I-79 technology corridor and in St. Lawrence County, New York, commercial products for the growing biometric authentication market, with the potential to license the products and create a spinoff.  The partnership engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include commercial companies affiliated with the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) at West Virginia University and Clarkson University, including the research and commercialization partner NexID Biometrics, LLC and technology investors, Morpho and Seaway Private Equity Corp.  The potential economic impact is expected to be the range of five to ten million dollars in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the biometric security market space.   The societal impact will address the national security needs for accurate human identification as well as quickly expanding commercial authentication markets.  The project will develop new pathways for the creation of entrepreneurial workforce through student-led project teams.  The activities will benefit from our strong commitment to bringing research and educational opportunities to students from the underrepresented groups.  The project will serve as a catalyst and a unique model for much needed technology-based economic growth in West Virginia and upstate New York.",
