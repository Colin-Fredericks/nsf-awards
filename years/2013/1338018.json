 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop unique Terahertz Electronics Characterization (TEC) System to enable investigations of advanced nanostructured novel THz electronics materials.\r\nThis system is a prerequisite for developing electronic devices and systems operating at terahertz frequencies.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed TEC System will be uniquely suited for characterization of advanced nanostructured THz electronics materials and devices and fundamental THz science studies. This will include studies of electron transport at THz frequencies and in ballistic devices, THz response of hot electrons, non-linear response at THz frequencies, device-circuit interaction, plasmonic crystal physics, near field imaging, THz system parameter extraction, studies of biomolecules, signatures of biological objects investigations of THz and sub-THz integrated circuits, fundamental research on high field subpicosecond transport, THz characterization of carbon-based, and topological insulator electronics (including single layer, few layer, and multiple layer graphene THz devices. \r\nBroader Impacts: The emerging advanced nanostructure electronic THz devices will enable massive new applications in homeland security, biotechnology, medicine, and industrial controls with multi billion market potential. Even beyond these applications, the nation to first develop THz electronics will control the future of electronics industry. The proposed THz electronic characterization system will allow for non-destructive characterization of THz nanostructures under operating conditions (i.e. under voltage bias and/or current flowing). This is the key for validation, understanding, and optimization of novel materials and devices for THz applications and for spectrum expansion for dramatic increase in bandwidth. Our preliminary measurements have already demonstrated potential for subwavelength terahertz imaging, ability to detect minute leakage currents, testing of high-speed ICs under bias, and potential for estimating the junction operating temperature at a nanoscale. Employing slit-periodic antennas and arrays of transistors should improve the device sensitivity by orders of magnitude.",
