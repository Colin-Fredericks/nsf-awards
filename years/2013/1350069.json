This award supports a workshop that will bring most of the Directorate of Geoscience (GEO) REU PI's together to discuss best practices in a changing REU landscape and to discuss common community issues, such as combining resources, creating common evaluation or application tools, and assessing the combined impact of REU-type programs in the Geosciences. Participants will include the leaders of REU Site programs supported by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences, Earth Sciences, Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and Polar Programs.",
