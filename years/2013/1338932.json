The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) as the lead institution, partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). \r\n\r\nAssistive technologies (AT) use computer tools and methods to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities, as well as to enhance the productivity of well-bodied people. ATs can improve work efficiency, identify safety risks, shorten the learning curve or worker training through simulations, improve resource allocation, creativity and communication. In healthcare environments, AT tools can enhance sensory and cognitive capabilities, improve training & delivery, enable remote monitoring, delay physical and cognitive decline in chronic conditions, personalize rehabilitation, predict risks for the elderly who live alone, monitor sleep disorders, design better prosthetics or drugs, design better robotic assistants, smart wheelchairs, therapy games and tools to monitor mental/physiological conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, or heart problems. \r\n\r\nThe center will promote the development of AT research infrastructure in industry, research centers and academia. It will help generate new jobs and new types of products and services. The proposed center will help prepare a future generation of competitive employees-scientists, and will provide new opportunities to engage students early, before graduation, in internship or research projects related to the company's interests. Both UTA and UTD, have a strong track record in training students in AT areas and have ongoing research that ranges from better ways to identify software errors, to analysis of facial expressions to identify arthritic pain, or efficient multimodal database searches.",

Assistive technologies (AT) within the scope of this proposal are computer aided tools and methods to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities, as well as to enhance the productivity of well-bodied people.\n \nMotivation\nATs have become the focus of attention of both academia and industry. The proposed I/UCRC center has the goal to bring together the two of them while performing a dual role. The first role is to support academic AT research that leads to innovation driven by industrial need. The second role is to attract industries interested in the development and commercialization of AT and to stimulate new research to help industries maintain their competitiveness.\n \nSummary of Planning Activities\nDuring the planning period, the center principal investigators identified companies interested in AT research and development. Together with the collaborating site at UTA they organized a planning workshop meeting where many of these companies were invited. A center website (iPerform.uta.edu) and center poster were developed to inform the public of the planning activities and to help new companies become members.  The PIs made the planning activities known in many conferences and meetings they attended, such the Petra conference (www.petrae.org), ICCABS 2014, and PDPTA 2014.\n \nProject Outcomes and Findings\nIndustrial contacts were established through the UTD and UTA respective Industrial Advisory Boards, as well as directly with national and international companies. Following the planning workshop, many individual meetings with companies took place in order to identify opportunities for research, development and commercialization. Following these activities, 14 companies sent commitment letters (six of them to UTD) and a full proposal was then submitted to NSF. The opportunities that were identified were connected to the strengths and track record residing in the two universities, UTA and UTD, which include: NSF-funded research on disabilities, in-place aging, rehabilitation; therapy tools for depression, arthritis, to enable assimilation into changing work environments, algorithm development and optimization, cyberphysical systems, cybersecurity, machine learning, data mining, big data analysis, software engineering, and embedded systems.\n \nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe center will promote innovation in academia that is driven by industrial needs. Research and development will be conducted that improves work efficiency, shortens the learning curve of training, improves resource allocation, creativity and communication, enhances human sensory and cognitive capabilities, designs better therapies, advances research in robotics, big data analytics, cybersecurity, machine learning, user interface design and databases.\nBroader Impacts\nThe planning grant helped identify critical areas of research that can greatly impact the quality of human life, reduce healthcare and productivity costs and enhance industrial and academic innovation in many areas. Example application areas that illustrate the center\u00c6s broader impacts are given below:\n\nManufacturing: can develop tools towards improving work efficiency in the workplace, identifying risks of safety, shortening the learning curve through training simulations, improving resource allocation, smart tools to identify security leaks, computer-aided tools to accelerate the training of new workers, improving both individual and group c..."
