 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Yitzhak Tor from the University of California, San Diego, to explore the interactions between small molecules and large biopolymers and cell surface components, using gold island-based localized plasmon transducers, as part of an International Collaboration in Chemistry.  As a proof-of-concept, this label-free method will be used to assess the affinity and selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics and their derivatives to the ribosomal decoding site RNA, a key recognition event that lowers the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. This system has been selected due to its fundamental significance, as it illustrates the fact that low molecular weight ligands are capable of meddling with a critical function of a large biological machine. The proposed research will shed light on the molecular features that govern the selectivity of the ligands selectivity toward the bacterial RNA, when compared to the human competing targets. Furthermore, advancing the proposed platform technology will facilitate a convenient, label-free exploration of diverse macromolecular recognition events where low molecular weight ligands influence the folding and function of key macromolecules. \r\n\r\nSmall molecules are capable of interfering with the function of critical cellular components, such as the ribosome, where all proteins are synthesized.  To learn about the molecular interactions involved, a new technology based on a specialized optical technique will be advanced, where the biological targets do not need to be modified or altered. In this fashion, information about the interaction of small molecules with diverse biological targets can be accumulated rapidly.  This pursuit will allow graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire training in diverse scientific disciplines, ranging from synthetic techniques to surface chemistry. This project will also be integrated into an outreach program to introduce high school students at the UCSD Preuss School to basic principles of chemistry and biology.  Simple lab experiments and demonstrations will be developed to illustrate the process of modifying surfaces by self-assembling ?designer? molecules and monitoring biorecognition events using straightforward optical instrumentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo facilitate the study of biomolecular interactions that are essential for sustaining life processes, new sensitive sensing devices have to be envisaged, designed and fabricated.  Such tools can advance the understanding of key processes that in many cases involve a ligand (guest) specifically interacting with a receptor (host).  The focus of this international collaboration grant was to construct biorecognition interfaces on gold nano-assemblies (small islands of gold particles), which upon adsorption of a specific molecule can sense the binding to its cognate receptor through a change in the properties of the metallic surface (in technical terms the transducers rely on Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance; LSPR).  Despite being conceptually straightforward, this approach has suffered from several drawbacks, primarily the need to prepare rather complex molecules, which were needed for the assembly of the sensors.  Through this particular grant support we were able to devise new general approaches for the assembly of such sensors and have applied them for the study of several biomolecular recognition events.  Specific sensors have thus been fabricated to study, for example, antibiotics binding to their cellular targets (in technical terms: binding of aminoglycosides to ribosomal RNA) and binding of antibodies to their specific targets.  The outcome of this work has therefore provided practical tools for biosensing and has illuminated the molecular interactions between various bioactive compounds and their cognate cellular targets.  In addition, compounds made for the project have enabled us to learn about factors impacting interactions with mammalian cell surfaces.  On a broader perspective, through these efforts young scholars have been trained in diverse and interdisciplinary fields and their professional growth, networking and preparation for their future independent scientific careers have been facilitated.  The discoveries made through the activities supported by this grant have advanced human knowledge, which, in the long run, will positively impact human health and well-being. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yitzhak Tor"
