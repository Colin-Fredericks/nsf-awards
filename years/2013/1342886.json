Among the topics to be discussed by speakers at this year's meeting are the following: classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry; operator algebras in solid state physics; rigidity for actions of countable groups on von Neumann algebras; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants; applications to geometric group theory; topological dynamics; K-theory and representation theory; quantum groups. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
