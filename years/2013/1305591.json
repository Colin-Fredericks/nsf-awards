 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent advances in atomic structure calculations and experimental techniques, atomic lithium has emerged as a promising system for exploring atomic and nuclear structure at new levels of sensitivity.  The relatively simple atomic structure of lithium provides an experimentally accessible system that can be calculated at a high level of accuracy.  This project provides a comprehensive investigation of the atomic structure of lithium utilizing an optical frequency comb.  The development of optical frequency combs has made it possible to effectively count the optical cycles of light, resulting in absolute optical-frequency calibration. In addition to its optical-frequency measurement capabilities, frequency combs provide a powerful source for direct excitation of atomic transitions.  The intellectual merit of this work is to provide significant improvement in the knowledge of the structure of atomic lithium and to further expand and develop techniques of precision spectroscopy by use of optical frequency combs.   \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work is the development of an undergraduate research program that will provide students with the opportunity to perform cutting-edge research.  The experiments are carried out at Oberlin College, a four-year liberal arts college that has a history of diversity and integration of teaching and research, and are performed solely by undergraduate students and the principal investigator. As a result, the work serves a dual role of advancing scientific discovery while training and teaching undergraduate students.  The nature of the work complements the teaching responsibilities of the principle investigator and allows the integration of research into the classroom and teaching laboratories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of the \"Precision Spectroscopy of High-Lying States of Atomic Lithium\" grant is to provide high-precision data on the atomic structure of lithium and develop novel spectroscopic techniques that utilize optical frequency combs.  Such spectroscopic measurements are crucial tests of our understanding of atomic structure and provide a window into nuclear structure.  Optical frequency combs represent a special type of laser that can be used as an optical-to-radio-frequency synthesizer, allowing one to measure optical frequencies with levels of accuracy exceeding a part in a trillion.  These lasers have resulted in optical frequency measurements becoming one of the most accurate types of measurement in all of science.\n\nThe grant has resulted in the development of a state-of-the art atomic physics laboratory that will enable the study of a number of energy levels of atomic lithium.  The included figure shows some typical spectroscopic data for two of the transitions of interest.  The figure shows the fluorescence resulting from laser light scattered by lithium atoms as the frequency of the laser light is changed.  The frequency of the light where the scattering is greatest is used to determine the atomic structure of the atoms.  The optical frequency comb provides the calibration and stabilization of the laser frequency.\n\nIn addition to the improved spectroscopic data, we have continued to study and refine techniques that utilize the output of the optical frequency combs to directly excite atoms.  We have explored this direct-frequency comb spectroscopy using potassium atoms confined to glass vapor cells.  These techniques will find application in a number of systems, including the study of high-lying levels in lithium.\n\nIn addition to providing significant scientific results, the project has had a broader impact by developing and training new students in experimental physics.  The project served as the subject of the honors theses for three undergraduate students during the funding period and provided research experience for a total of six undergraduate students. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Stalnaker"
