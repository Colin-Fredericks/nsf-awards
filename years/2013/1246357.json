 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nEvidence from the eastern Ross Sea continental shelf indicates that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet advanced and retreated during the last glacial cycle, but it is unclear whether the ice sheet advanced to the shelf edge or just to the middle shelf. These two end-member scenarios offer different interpretations as to why, how, and when the West Antarctic Ice Sheet oscillated. The PI proposes to acquire seismic, multibeam, and core data from Whales Deep, to evaluate the timing and duration of two advances of grounded ice to the outer and middle shelf of the Whales Deep Basin, a West Antarctic Ice Sheet paleo ice stream trough in eastern Ross Sea. Grounding events are represented by seismically resolvable Grounding Zone Wedges. The PI will collect radiocarbon dates on in situ benthic foraminifera from the grounding zone diamict as well as ramped pyrolysis radiocarbon dates on acid insoluble organics from open-marine mud overlying the grounding zone diamict. Using these data the PI will calculate the duration of the two grounding events. Furthermore, the PI will test a numerical model prediction that West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat must have involved melting at the marine terminus of the ice sheet. Pore-water from the grounding zone diamict will be extracted from piston cores to determine salinity and &#948;18O values that should indicate if significant melting occurred at the grounding line.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe data collected will provide constraints on the timing and pattern of Last Glacial Maximum advance and retreat that can be incorporated into interpretations of ice-surface elevation changes. The proposed activities will provide valuable field and research training to undergraduate/graduate students and a Louisiana high-school science teacher. The research will be interactively shared with middle- and high-school science students and with visitors to the LSU Museum of Natural Science Weekend-Science Program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe scientific objectives of this project involved reconstructing details of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) retreat from the maximum extent it obtained during the last glacial maximum (LGM).  To address these objectives, we acquired new marine geological and geophysical data aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer RVIB during the 2015 austral summer. The data were collected from the Whales Deep Basin on the outer and middle continental shelf of eastern Ross Sea because this area was formerly occupied by grounded and floating ice of the WAIS.  Two types of geophysical data that were important to our scientific objectives were collected:  1) reflection seismic data and 2) multibeam swath bathymetry. Reflection seismic data provides a view of the seafloor topography and sub-seafloor stratification.  These data allowed us to identify the location of buried erosional surfaces and subsurface units that were deposited by the WAIS during its post-LGM retreat. Multibeam swath bathymetry data provides a detailed three-dimensional view of the seafloor.  In combination with the seismic reflection data, the detailed three-dimensional images of the seafloor morphology allowed us to map the locations where post-LGM erosional surfaces and deposits are preserved at the seafloor.  Recognizing the map location of these preserved proximal glacial deposits was critical to the project outcomes because they provide unambiguous direct evidence that show the former extents of grounded ice.  Geologic data were acquired at key locations that were selected based on our onboard interpretation of the geophysical data.  The geological data acquired included sediment cores.  The sediment cores are used to confirm the interpretation of geophysical data but also to provide additional details that are used to reconstruct the former extent of ice shelve (floating ice) and the transition to the open-water conditions that exist today on the outer and middle continental shelf of the Whales Deep Basin.  The sediment cores are important for another key reason because they provide material that can be used to constrain the retreat history via radiocarbon dating.\n\nOur team?s synthesis of the new Whales Deep Basin data plus that of previously acquired data demonstrate that in this sector of eastern Ross Sea, the WAIS retreat from its maximum extent was underway by ~14,700 years ago.  Grounded ice remained within 70 kilometers (42 miles) of its former maximum extent for approximately three millennia. The long-duration stillstand in the extent of grounded ice was maintained downstream of a topography bottleneck by accelerated ice-volume discharge and sedimentation at the seaward termination of grounded ice.  The grounding-zone sedimentation created a foredeepened (landward dipping) subglacial topography and the stillstand in the extent of grounded ice ended shortly after ~11,500 years ago with an abrupt 200 kilometer shift (120 miles) to Roosevelt Island, a broad shallow submarine bank that re-buttressed WAIS discharge.  Previously published data indicates that the Roosevelt Island stillstand ended 3200 years ago and that the extent of grounded ice has since shifted landward an additional 500 kilometers (300 miles) to its current configuration.  Our data from the outer and middle continental shelf indicate that during the post-LGM, the WAIS oscillated between long-duration stillstands and abrupt long-distance shifts to a new stable position.  The ice sheet changes described here contributed to post-LGM sea-level rise.  The reconstruction of the post-LGM retreat provides an important geological perspective on the current configuration of the ice sheet as well as to the progression, magnitudes and rates of changes to grounded and floating ice that may occur in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip J Bart"
