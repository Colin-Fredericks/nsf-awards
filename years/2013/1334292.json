 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an era when governments worldwide are too cash-strapped to build or upgrade sorely needed infrastructure, some have experimented with long-term concessions (often referred to as public-private partnerships, or P3s) to private consortia to finance, design, build, operate and maintain infrastructure assets. P3s offer potential solutions to this infrastructure challenge, along with political challenges.  Existing governance theories (typically drawn from economics, sociology, psychology or public administration) provide partial insights for governing shorter-lived, less complex transactions, but are inadequate to guide the necessary legislation, contracts, and management practices for P3 infrastructure projects to thrive and remain sustainable over their typical 30-year concession terms.  This project integrates and expands upon previous work to build a cross disciplinary theoretical framework that will ultimately help design new governance approaches for enhancing the efficiency and speed-of-delivery advantages of P3s.\r\n\r\nEconomists agree that investments in expanded delivery of high quality civil infrastructure assets provide enormous and widely shared public benefits. Such investments can also generate multi-decade, relatively low-risk, inflation-adjusted cash flows, so they offer excellent investment opportunities for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors who could deploy their huge pools of capital into P3 infrastructure projects to stabilize and boost their portfolio investment returns while supporting worthy economic development.  This project will also inform the governance of complex and multi-faceted organizations, such as P3s, with recommendations for both future research and new public policy initiatives.",

This was the stated objective of the project, and we feel it has been significantly advanced.\n\nFor the front-end, project shaping phase of  Public-Private Partnership infrastructure projects, we integrated perspectives from public administration, stakeholder theory, and social network analysis.\n\nFor the design and construction phase of these projects, we integrated theory from sociology on organization design and institutions, with ideas about small group dynamics from sociology, transaction-cost economics and psychology.\n\nFor the design of contracts to deliver high risk, long-term, public-private partnership infrastructure concessions, we brought together legal and financial theories on relational contracting and real options.\n\nBy collecting and organizing these integrated sets of theories across the lifecycle of projects in an upcoming book, we have created a theoretical synthesis that should be a valuable starting point for many new directions of  interdisciplinary research on the globally important problem of delivering infrastructure more effectively and sustainably to citizens around the world. \n\nBeyond its impact on the field of project management for infrastructure delivery, the findings from this research should be applicable to many other industries that are adopting service-based business models in place of asset sales, including  businesses like Uber, AirBNB,  jet engines being sold by the hour,  imaging  services (instead of equipment) being sold to hospitals, and so on.\n\n \n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\nThis project has provided research training for multiple undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs, more than half of them women, and including one African-American woman.\n\nIn addition, we collaborated with colleagues in the  School of Education at Stanford University to develop a high school curriculum for social studies and civics classes that can introduce high school citizens to the complexities of infrastructure project finance, funding and delivery in ways that can make a more informed citizens.
