 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, \"Graduate 10K+,\" an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade.\r\n\r\nCalifornia State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) and Hartnell College have assessed the challenges facing underrepresented and disadvantaged students seeking educational opportunities in computer science. Given the obstacles and the resources available, CSUMB and Hartnell committed to developing a three-year bachelor's degree option coupled with significant student support structures and financial assistance as a way to improve outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe project is incorporating the following features:\r\no\tCollaboration between a 2- and 4- year college, in which students are completing the first 1.5 years of the program primarily at Hartnell and the final 1.5 years primarily at CSUMB; \r\no\tImproving the college-readiness of students through a summer bridge program;\r\no\tOrganizing students into cohorts that are maintained from enrollment through transfer and graduation;\r\no\tProviding ongoing academic support through identification of academic needs and provision of support services;\r\no\tDelivering career development support through workshops and internship placements;\r\no\tProviding scholarship support that eliminates the need for students to seek outside employment.\r\no\tExecuting a detailed evaluation plan with an external evaluator to study the performance of project components.     \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the project has secured a commitment from the Matsui Foundation, a local non-profit organization, to provide significant funding that supports full scholarships for students.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in its implementation of a three-year Bachelor of Science degree program in computer science/information technology (CSIT) to successfully attract, retain, transfer, and graduate students from disadvantaged and underrepresented populations. The project incorporates three critical components: (1) an accelerated three-year time frame, (2) collaboration between a community college and a university, and (3) a cohort-based learning model. \r\n\r\nThe project's broader impacts are felt in the increased access to computer science and success of 150 underrepresented and disadvantaged students, through the combination of an accelerated program, student scholarships, student cohorts, and leveraging computer science support programs. Dissemination of evaluation data and best practices from this project are also providing substantial information to education leaders to duplicate collaborative three or four year pathways that utilize resources of multiple institutions to increase retention and graduation of students in computer science and STEM.",

A publication documenting this model received the best paper recognition at ACM SIGCSE 2018 conference.\n\nThe work completed under this project has directly impacted over 160 students who have participated in the program, as well as had a significant impact on the overall quality of the CS programs at Hartnell and Cal State Monterey Bay by strengthening the community college to university pipeline, attracting new industry partners, and building academic and extra-curricular support programming that is available to all students. It was the catalyst for launching a similar 4-year, cohort-based pathway for incoming CS freshmen at Cal State Monterey Bay that has since included over 100 participants, and is being replicated in Southern California with cohorts starting at El Camino College and at California State University Dominguez Hills in fall 2019.\n\nNotable improvements in key metrics evaluated by the program include:\n\n\nA significant increase in the capacity of the CS program at CSUMB. CSUMB is one of the smallest campuses in the 23-campus CSU system that serves almost 500K students.  However, it produced 1/17 of all CSU CS graduates in Spring 2018.\n\n\nA significant demographic shift in CSUMB CS graduates. Prior to launching its CS cohort programs, in Spring 2013, CSUMB produced 1/34 of all Hispanic CS graduates from across the CSU and 1/30 of all female CS graduates. As of Spring 2017, CSUMB produced 1/13 of all Hispanic CS graduates and 1/11 of female CS graduates in the CSU system.\n\n\n184 students completed CS internships in summer 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Organizations include Adobe, Allstate, Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, BofA, Cisco, Code2040, Driscoll, eBay, Facebook, Google, Intuit, NASA Ames, Nationwide, Salesforce, Uber, VmWare, and Zynga.\n\n\nImproved completion and transfer rates from community college to university. The average 1.5 year Associate degree completion rate and transfer rate for participating students is 83.2% (134 out of 161 cohort students).\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sathya Narayanan"
