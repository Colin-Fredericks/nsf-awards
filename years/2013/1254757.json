 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop large-area, low-cost organic field-effect transistors and organic photovoltaics with unprecedented performance and reproducibility. This goal will be achieved by using single-crystals to design and implement novel materials and device architectures. Results obtained on charge injection and transport will enable engineering of these high performance devices by spray-deposition.\r\nThe intellectual merit inheres in (1) exploring the intrinsic properties of soluble small-molecule organic semiconductors in single-crystal form, (2) incorporating successful candidates in spray-deposited devices, and (3) optimizing their performance by controlling film uniformity and device structure. Nondestructive contact deposition techniques will be used with high mobility semiconductors and with dielectrics promoting reduced operating voltages. Exploring the interplay between processing details and the resulting contact effects, film microstructure and charge transport will provide feedback for developing better devices. The project is transformational in devising a unique platform to answer questions about charge transport in technologically relevant materials, being the first to use single crystals of materials compatible with solution-deposition techniques.\r\nThe broader impacts are aligned with the anticipated importance of organic electronics to our economic progress; project results will advance high-performance devices that spark a new technology. In addition, graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will gain knowledge and skill sets spanning crystal growth, device design, fabrication and characterization. Infrastructure and results will be integrated in a new course and outreach programs at the local science museum. The PI will persuade girls that science careers are exciting and possible.",
