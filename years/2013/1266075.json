 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project is being undertaken by Dr. Leon L. Shaw, University of Connecticut, and Dr. Mahmoud Farag Zawrah, National Research Center of Egypt on the topic of using waste silica fume to produce silicon nitride - silicon carbide (Si3N4/SiC) nanocomposites for use in high temperature applications such as turbine or engine components.  Waste silica fume will be ball milled in order to reduce particle size and to achieve desired mixture of components, with milling time a primary variable for the investigation. Control of interfacial chemistry will involve experiments with and without sintering aids in order to optimize results during sintering.  For each of the resulting samples, mechanical properties of creep strength, fracture toughness, and thermal shock resistance will be measured.\r\n\r\nThe proposal presents a creative mix of basic materials science and engineering to address practical problems.  The research has the potential to provide beneficial outcomes such as the development of high temperature structural materials for gas turbine propulsion systems and for power-producing energy systems.  If successful, this process of preparing nanocomposites would result in an effective waste stream re-use, with significant environmental benefits.  Additionally, the collaboration with Egyptian scientists brings complementary skills, as well as the opportunity for training of both US and Egyptian students.\r\n\r\nThe project is funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research.",
