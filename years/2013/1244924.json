For instance the interaction of large cyclonic and mesoscale storm systems with the atmospheric moisture balance in a changing climate and with a warming ocean are curiously different from the corresponding Arctic case.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to better quantify the contribution of water vapor transport, and especially  the mesoscale drivers of synoptic variability, on the surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets, and also to the annual progression of Southern Ocean  sea-ice. \r\n \r\nTo investigate the role of these mesoscale cyclonic storm systems, a variety of satellite data products, best available reanalysis products and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model predictions will be used to developed scenarios for changes in cyclone frequencies and strength in an intensifying hydrological cycle, and the impacts these may have on Antarctic sea-ice and continental surface mass balances.",

This observational finding confirms numerical model analyses and prior theoretical research. Although these occurrences have been well characterized, determining well-defined reasoning why they take place is less clear.
