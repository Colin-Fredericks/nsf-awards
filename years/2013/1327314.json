 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of both the educational and research components of this CAREER plan is to foster an improved understanding of multi-scale material behavior in the civil engineering community.  The principal objective of the research plan is to link the inherent, aging viscoelastic properties of the nanometric, cement paste phases to macroscale viscoelastic response of portland cement paste.  The research plan will utilize an integrated experimental, analytical, and computational materials science approach to model the inherent aging viscoelastic properties of the nanometric phases of hydrating portland cement.  Subsequently, the aging viscoelastic properties of bulk cement paste will be modeled using composite microstructural finite element models.  The principal objective of the education plan is to develop an ?analogy inventory? for improved education of future civil engineers with analogies as teaching tools of abstract multi-scale materials science concepts.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research and education plan will ultimately transform the way concrete is designed, resulting in safer, more sustainable concrete infrastructure.  The educational component will revamp materials science curricula for future engineers so that they have an improved grasp of the influence of nanoscale properties on macroscale behavior of engineering materials, allowing the findings from multi-scale material research to be rapidly adopted in practice.  The framework developed for the creation of analogy inventories will be applicable to alternative disciplines, ultimately affecting engineering education as a whole.  Additionally, the methodology developed in this project for modeling nanoscale aging viscoelastic properties will be applicable to several other fields of study including biomechanics and polymer science.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is a well-established fact that concrete evolves over time in both properties and behavior.  As the cement within the concrete chemically reacts, the material becomes stronger and stiffer.  However, this evolution also causes dimensional changes in the concrete (shrinkage) and overall displacements in concrete when subject to loading (creep).  Traditional approaches to characterizing creep and shrinkage have relied upon empirical observations and predicted future behavior based on what had been observed in the past.  This research instead examines the fundamental characteristics of the cement paste within concrete during its early age to more fully understand the scientific and engineering mechanisms which lead to the observed behavior.\n\nThe research was conducted at three different scales.  At the macro scale, with specimen dimensions on the order of several to several dozen millimeters, mechanical testing of miniature beams was conducted to observe responses over time.  This research, coupled with both theoretical models and chemical testing of the beams, led to the conclusion that stresses in the cement paste have a significant influence on potential composition and future response of that paste.  In other words, not only does concrete evolve naturally, but the application of loads to that concrete significantly alter that evolution.  The quantification of this affect is an entirely new result. Additional testing at the micro-scale (dimensions in micrometers) and nanoscale (nanometers) confirmed not only the macro-scale behaviors and results from previous research but led to further findings of responses to stress not previously considered.  Stresses tend to accelerate hydration of cement through enhancing dissolution of cement grains within the cement paste.  Models were produced based on the experimental results and show promise that future predictions of concrete behavior can be made based solely on the scientific mechanisms involved and without significant reliance on empirical observation. Such models would be significantly more robust than current approaches, and allow rapid adoption of new concrete mixture formulations and ingredients, such as waste products from other industries.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zachary Grasley"
