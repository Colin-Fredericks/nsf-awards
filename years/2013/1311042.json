 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Elizabeth A. Jensen of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Tohoku Gakuin University in Sendai, Japan.  The project title is \"Distributed Algorithms for Multi-Robot Dispersion and Exploration.\" The host scientist is Dr. Ken Sugawara.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, using a team of robots has become a popular method for exploring both known and unknown environments.  In particular, teams of robots are being used with increasing frequency in areas such as surveillance or search and rescue.  In this research, the primary interest is in scenarios in which there are too few robots to completely cover an environment simultaneously, where communication is limited in range, and where the robots are required to maintain communication with at least one other robot at all times.  These restrictions make the exploration and coordination of the team more complicated, but simplify the robots needed, thus making team of these robots more attainable and easier to maintain or replace.  This project includes the development of one or more distributed algorithms for dispersion of a multi-robot team into an unknown environment.  The performance of the algorithms is being tested in both simulation and experiments with physical robots in a variety of environments, including office building and open cave scenarios. This project will lead to increases in the ability of simple, inexpensive robots to explore large and complex indoor environments, making them more useful in real life situations, such as search and rescue or Mars exploration.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this research will also provide algorithms for multi-robot exploration, disseminated through publications and participation in conferences and workshops, which can be used in courses to teach about distributed systems and robotics.",

We were particularly interested in distributed algorithms, in which each robot would act independently of the other robots&mdash;by which we mean the robots made their decisions of what action to take individually&mdash;though with some additional information provided by the other robots.  Though a distributed algorithm allows for less communication in general, it also requires more attention to the coordination aspect of the robot team. \n\nIn our scenario, fully exploring the environment is crucial, but communicating any points of interest to the human rescue team is also critical.  In an earlier algorithm, the exploration and dispersion into the environment is achieved through the use of wireless signal intensity, but in the given environment, this was infeasible.  Instead, we altered the algorithm to use chemical-based communication to send basic messages and guide the robots through the environment to the unexplored frontiers.\n\nOn the research side of this project, we started with preparing the experiment environment and becoming familiar with the robots and camera software. We modified 10 E-Puck robots to have infrared LEDs on the top and three infrared sensors to detect the colors red, blue, and green below the robot.  We calibrated the cameras to correct for distortion in the lenses, so that we could track the robots and display their locations on the screen accurately.  We also made walls that could be moved within the environment to allow for different configurations in experiments.  With these basics completed, we developed a program to locate multiple robot positions and display them to the screen.  We then modified an earlier iteration of the dispersion algorithm to work without direct robot-to-robot communication (which was a critical component of the earlier version).  We tested the algorithm in physical experiments with modified E-Puck robots on an LED screen with two cameras to track the robots\u00c6 locations and display graphics on the screen below the robots.  Preliminary results are promising, and we continue to collaborate to achieve more definitive results for possible publication.\n\nWith regards to the broader impacts, for the PI this was an excellent opportunity to learn not only about the scientific community and ways of doing research in Japan, but also an opportunity to learn about Japanese culture and language, through a class on traditional Japanese archery, Kyudo, and lab group gatherings where the researchers cooked the meal and discussed Japanese culture.
