The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. \r\n\r\nA year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe crustal rocks beneath the coastal plain of North Carolina and Virginia record the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea creating the Atlantic Ocean.  This breakup started about 230 million years ago and continues today.  The breakup produced a complex sequence of magmatic and tectonic events recorded in the crustal structures and sediments buried under the Atlantic coastal plain.  During June 2015 two land crustal seismic profiles were shot across the coastal plain of North Carolina and Virginia.  These profiles were extensions of offshore marine profiles shot in 2014.\n\n \n\nThe ENAM land seismic experiment consisted of these two crustal scale profiles of approximately 220 km in length each.  Line 2, which was shot first, extends from Camp Lejeune, NC to near Sanford, NC.  800 Texan seismographs deployed along Line 2.  Line 1, which was shot second, extends from north of Kitty Hawk, NC to west of Alberta, VA, also with 800 Texans deployed. \n\n \n\nIn addition, to these two lines a small explosives test was conduct in November 2013 to determine the parameters that would affect the efficiency of shots, i.e., explosive type and charge geometry.  The immediate result of this explosive test was the confirmation that emulsion type blasting agents would produce the best seismic shot.  However, these blasting agents are liquid and have a density lower than that of the fluid in many boreholes.  To solve this problem and the problem of unstable boreholes in the coastal plain, a cartridge was designed to contain the explosive and keep it at a specific position in the borehole.  These cartridges were filled with blasting agent, primed, and pushed down boreholes with the drill stem of the drill.  The borehole was then backfilled to keep the cartridge in position.  This method of loading explosive into boreholes was so successful we have used it on other experiments.\n\n \n\nData from the two main lines across the coastal plain are being interpreted by a number of groups and scientific results should be published soon.  All of these data including the explosive test data have been archived at the IRIS/DMC and can be accessed by anyone.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven H Harder"
