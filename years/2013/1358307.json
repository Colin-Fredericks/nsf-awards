 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to further develop a prototype for a chemical method for making a thin film solar cell material.  The team has developed a deposition process using raw materials composed of highly abundant and non-toxic elements to produce an environmentally-friendly and low-cost solar cell. Prototype development will involve flow-through reactors where several processes happen simultaneously and synergistically. The team will be looking to further understand the heat flow, chemical diffusion, reaction kinetics, surface nucleation, viscosity effects and reaction byproducts of the method.\r\n\r\nIf successfully developed, this technology could facilitate adoption of solar energy production by significantly reducing solar cell production costs. Broad adoption of solar is a key element in the global effort to reduce the negative effects of climate change and this technology could play a prominent role in leveraging solar energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuel sources.",
