 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CC-NIE Networking Infrastructure project overcomes geographical and technological barriers at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) with major upgrades to network infrastructure, connectivity, and the science DMZ. These upgrades support expanded research and teaching capabilities and improve capacity for data-driven research across a variety of STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nNetwork enhancements under construction consist of two fiber optic installation builds, one enabling a protected 10 Gb/s Ethernet connection from the SFA main campus to the Internet2 and the Lonestar Education and Research Network (LEARN) point-of-presence in Houston and the other from the SFA main campus to the remote SFA Observatory and Walter C. Todd Agricultural Research complex. Upgrades in progress increase the capacity of the science DMZ from 1 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s to allow for the rapid exchange of large datasets outside of the university's protective firewall. Installation of a 10 GB/s PerfSONAR node allows SFA to benchmark performance to relevant sites and to monitor network performance. \r\n\r\nApplications include research endeavors in physics and astronomy, agriculture, biology, biotechnology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and statistics, forestry, and geospatial sciences that will directly benefit from the ability to manipulate, manage, and transfer larger data sets. Additionally, the enhanced infrastructure will improve capacity for collaborative research on campus, nationally, and globally, and afford full use of existing networks, such as LEARN, internet2, REDDnet and AmericaView. The networking improvements will also enhance both graduate and undergraduate curricula in these and other STEM disciplines and allow for increased student participation in data-intensive research.",

Todd Agricultural Research Center (ARC) has seen a major improvement in the network in both throughput and reliability.  One of the facilities that have benefited from this upgrade the most has been the SFA Observatory.  This upgrade has made it possible for researchers to remotely access the computers controlling the telescopes and has allowed users from other facilities to utilize the telescopes.   For example, a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy recently completed a thesis involving the remote control of a telescope for use in near-earth asteroid detection. The USGS seismic station, the weather station and all-sky camera located at the SFA Observatory have also benefited from this project.  Network outages were common before the fiber was in place which caused gaps in the reporting of the data collected by the sites.  Now the stations are reporting data and images to researcher and the public in real time without interruptions.  Other facilities at the ARC are now able to use the network for teaching classes and transferring data to and from the main campus.  The DeWitt School of Nursing is now able to utilize cloud base simulations for their students when they are not in the simulation labs giving the students more time to prepare for clinicals.  \n\nWith the addition of the 10 GB/s link to Internet2 we have improved access to cloud services on campus such as Microsoft Office 365 which allows our student the ability to work on projects, share data and collaborate on projects from anywhere.  The students access Microsoft Office 365 services on campus through the Internet2 TR-CPS services which traverse SFASU\u00c6s 10 GB/s link.  We also house depots for the Earth Observation Depot Network (EODN), a distributed content distribution system for remote sensing data which is based on an NSF funded projects, the Data Logistics Toolkit(DLT) NSF#1246282.  These depots have been able to utilize the improved throughput to load and distribute remote sensing data to end users.  Other research projects are starting to take shape.  Our ScienceDMZ, which is a restricted portion of our network which is designed to host research based high performance scientific applications, is starting to grow.  The computing resources from the Columbia Regional Geospatial Service Center have been dedicated to the ScienceDMZ and are being prepared for use on new research projects.\n\nBy connecting all of our outlying facilities we have been able to provide resources that were not previously available for research and instruction.  The ease of which we are able to collect and store data across the network at the facilities now is making research more efficient and hopefully allowing for additional research as time moves forward.  The implementation has been a great success and will be serving our research community for many years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modifie..."
