 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data-driven innovation requires a foundation of infrastructure to support the sharing, access, use, re-use, analysis, and stewardship of digital data. Data infrastructure includes cyber-infrastructure tools for data discovery and analysis (and their underlying technical structures and components -- persistent digital identifiers, shared metadata frameworks, etc.), and social infrastructure in the form of community policy and organizational practice (harmonization of standards, approaches for data access and preservation, etc.). To address the growing global need for data infrastructure, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) was planned and launched in FY13 as an international community-driven organization. RDA's mission is to build the social, organizational, and technical infrastructure needed to reduce barriers to data sharing and exchange, and to accelerate data-driven innovation world-wide. In the wake of precipitous growth, RDA is now working to develop a stable support model for at least a five-year period. The RDA 2 project provides support for U.S. participation and leadership within the RDA, as well as strategic expansion of the U.S. community within RDA (RDA/U.S.). RDA 2 integrates a) strategic efforts and pilots to expand, diversify, and strengthen the RDA/U.S. community, and b) support for U.S. contributions to RDA operations and leadership, including U.S. participation in, and hosting of, RDA Plenaries. RDA/U.S. will be led by a Steering Committee consisting of Fran Berman, RPI (Chair), Beth Plale, IU, (Vice Chair, Technical Programs), Larry Lannom, CNRI, (Vice Chair, Outreach and Development) and Mark Parsons, RPI (Managing Director).\r\n\r\nThe RDA 2 project builds RDA through increasing U.S. engagement and leadership. RDA 2 builds RDA/U.S. through pilots in three strategic areas: Community Engagement and Outreach, Student and Early Career Engagement, and Adoption and Impact Amplification. The pilots are designed to expand and diversify RDA/U.S. data community, increase the impact of RDA deliverables in the U.S., and enhance the benefit of RDA for U.S. institutions, communities, businesses, and individuals. A strong RDA/U.S. can be a vehicle for accelerating U.S. innovation, and positioning the U.S. community for greater competitiveness and leadership. RDA/U.S. can contribute to the data infrastructure needed to make new U.S. policy approaches and initiatives work, and serve as a means of capitalizing",

With the support of National Science Foundation (NSF), the EU Commission, the Australian Government and others, the RDA was launched in 2013 and has grown to be a vibrant and useful organization of nearly 12000 members from 130+ countries all over the world.\n\nNSF funding was seminal with respect to the founding, development, and growth of the RDA and has helped create an organization that benefits data researchers and practitioners throughout the US and globally.  The \"products\" of RDA are infrastructure needed to facilitate the sharing and exchange of data and include semantics, vocabularies, models, machine-actionable templates, community principles and curricula.   Dozens of pieces of useful and used infrastructure have been created by the RDA community.  These include common semantics for agricultural data, a COVID-19 Zotero Library, principles and implementation guidelines to facilitate legal interoperability of research data, and guidelines for citing dynamic data sets in publications, among many others.  RDA infrastructure products are currently being used by the SEAGrid Science and Engineering Gateway, the United Nations, the Climate Change Centre in Austria, and many other projects, organizations, and consortia. \n\nAdditionally, RDA has served as a partner and a gathering place for data-enabled communities and data infrastructure-related organizations.  Its twice-yearly Plenaries attract hundreds of participants from a diverse set of data-related professions, countries, and career levels.  The Plenaries have also become a venue for related organizations to hold side meetings synergistic with the RDA mission, creating an even more diverse community and opportunities for collaboration for RDA members and the broader community.\n\nEach of the RDA regions brings its own projects, priorities, and programs to the international organization.  In addition to serving as a co-founder of the organization, the U.S. region of the RDA has been particularly active in creating student and early career programs and \"adoption\" programs that help projects and organizations embed RDA infrastructure in their local infrastructure environments.
