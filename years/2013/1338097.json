 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an integrated Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) system with diverse functions at the Stillwater Campus of Oklahoma State University (OSU). The main FTIR spectrometer is equipped with state-of-the-art optics and electronics resulting in unprecedented accuracy of FTIR data collection. Integration of an array of components, including tunable nanosecond laser, cryogenic system, infrared microscope, focal plane array detector, and temperature controlled attenuated total reflection cell, makes this instrument a rare and one of the most powerful and versatile FTIR systems for biological research. This multi-functional advanced FT-IR system will significantly impact and enable a broad range of research projects, including but not limited to: develop infrared structural biology for structure-function studies of proteins, investigate principles in receptor activation in biological signaling, explore catalytic mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation for bio-energy, probe structural dynamics of IL-18:IL-18BP complex formation for autoimmune responses, and analyze polymer nanocoatings for biomedical applications. This system will also be used to characterize biopharmaceuticals for vaccine formulations, and investigate cellular responses in endothelial cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels upon sheer stress for bioengineering of artificial heart.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will be housed in the Henry Bellmon Research Center, a recently completed state-of-the- art building dedicated fully to cutting edge multidisciplinary research. The advanced FT-IR system will be used to catalyze the developments and applications of the emerging field of infrared structural biology of proteins that will significantly impact a wide range of research in life sciences, including basic research, bio-energy, and biomedical research. This powerful and versatile instrument will significantly enhance the research not only by a large number of OSU researchers, but also external users, including from California and New York. An annual workshop on Infrared Structural Biology and a new course on \"Infrared Biology: FT-IR Spectroscopy and Imaging\" will be initiated and offered to train postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, including many under-represented minorities. To increase the participation and research experience of under-represented minorities, we have established partnerships with Langston University (85% minority students in a historically black college), Northeastern State University (40% minority students with high percentage of native Americans), and two minority programs in Oklahoma State University-Stillwater campus;the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK- LSAMP) and the Native Americans in Biological Sciences (NABS) Center. Building on the existing strength of the PI, a leader in promoting women in physics, and 6 women and 2 minority team members, continued efforts will be made to encourage, mentor, and train women and minority scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels.",

The main FT-IR spectrometer is a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer (Vertex 80v) that is equipped with state-of-the-art optics and electronics resulting in unprecedented accuracy of FTIR data collection. A laser system was installed and integrated. The laser generates short laser pulses of nanosecond duration at desired colors (tunable in color) to trigger and activate biological functions of photoactive proteins. Synchronization of laser pulses with the main FT-IR spectrometer enables time-resolved FT-IR measurements for probing proteins in action. Time-resolved FT-IR data collection is highly sensitive to vibrations. A large, specially engineered optical table (5? x 12?) (Newport) plays a crucial role in protecting the FT-IR system from floor vibrations and significantly reducing FT-IR data noises caused by vibrations.</p>\n<p>As a multi-user facility, the capability to allow rapid switch from one user?s FT-IR setup into another user?s FT-IR setup is crucial. For this purpose, two additional sample compartments were installed. This allows three parallel experiments: one for time-resolved FT-IR (using laser pulses); one for FT-IR I (ATR sample cell); and one for temperature resolved FT-IR II (fixed sample thickness).</p>\n<p>Another advanced FT-IR technology is infrared spectroscopic imaging. The beauty of FT-IR imaging is its capability to detect spatial <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">chemical distribution</span> at microscopic levels.
