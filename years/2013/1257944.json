 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to study nitrogen (N) cycles in the Brazilian Amazon. The research aims at quantifying N transformation and transport pathways in natural and agricultural settings in the Neotropics. The shift in agriculture combined with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer inputs in tropical regions have the potential to drive profound losses of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, or increased movement of soluble N to rivers and streams. The proposed field research will quantify N2O fluxes and N fate in the vadose zone, groundwater and streams under natural conditions (tropical forest), single cropping of soybeans, and double cropping with soybeans and maize.  Remote sensing will be used to scale up results from the field and model to the Amazon region, and incorporation of research results into a dynamic vegetation model (IBIS) that has been parameterized for the Amazon and will be used to estimate N emissions under different climate and land use management scenarios in the future. The work will test two hypotheses: (1) that increased N fertilization will lead to moderately but not greatly higher N2O emissions compared to natural forest because soils are well-drained and are not expected to go anaerobic long enough for accumulation of N2O, and (2) that N losses to streams will be minimal in N-fertilized plots because of high rates of uptake by maize crop and retention of any residual N leachates in deep, clay soils through anion exchange.\r\n\r\nThe research will aid in understanding effects of changing agricultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions and stream pollution in the Amazon. Partnerships with local Brazilian scientists and training of US and Brazilian students will be important impacts from the research. Public outreach and broad dissemination of results will be achieved through regular presentations to agricultural producers and policy makers in Brazil through established contacts, as well as the support of a US journalist to visit the research field sites, which are locations of long-term ecological and biogeochemical research.",

At the center of this region is Mato Grosso, a Texas-sized state where land use and agricultural practices have shifted from forest to pasture to single-cropped soybeans since the mid-1980s. During the last ten years, more than half of this cropland shifted from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropped soybeans with corn, planted sequentially during the same growing season. This rapid expansion and intensification of agriculture has the potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient runoff to surface waters, as widely observed in fertilizer-intensive soybean- and corn-producing regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Because the climate and soils in tropical regions differ from those in the temperate zone, it is unclear whether the magnitude and controls on greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient runoff from tropical croplands will follow patterns observed in other places. This is important to understand, given that most future expansion of croplands worldwide will occur in the tropics.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>This project quantified emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, as well as the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from native forests and intensifying croplands on a large commercial soybean farm in Mato Grosso. Experimental watersheds ranged from 2-13 km<sup>2</sup>, allowing comparison of runoff and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and stream water across land uses, including 3 watersheds in forest, 3 in single-cropped soybeans, and 3 in double-cropped soybeans and corn. The project also included a controlled nitrogen fertilizer addition experiment in soybean-corn cropland, which compared the fate of nitrogen applied at levels that ranged from no nitrogen to 200 kg N per hectare, and included the current practice of 80 kg N per hectare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Results indicated that the transition from forest to cropland increases water discharge from small watersheds by about four-fold. However, the transition from forest to single-cropping and later double-cropping did not increase the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in groundwater or streams.

Higher rates of nitrogen fertilizer resulted in excess N, which ended up adsorbed in soils at depths to 4 meters or greater. This demonstrated a mechanism that currently prevents nitrogen from moving from crop fields to groundwater and streams. Under current management practices, emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide were similar among forest, single-cropped soybeans, and double-cropped soybeans and corn. Higher rates of nitrogen fertilizer application also resulted in very modest increases of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide from less than 0.3 kg N per hectare (no fertilizer) to 0.8 kg N per hectare (200 kg N per hectare of fertilizer). Fluxes of other nitrogen gases (nitrous oxide and di-nitrogen gas) represented more important pathways of nitrogen fertilizer loss, but these were small compared with the total nitrogen added to the system by nitrogen-fixing soybeans and fertilizers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>These results show that the understanding of nitrous oxide emissions and nitrogen runoff derived from studies in temperate croplands is a poor predictor of patterns observed in intensifying Amazon croplands. Deep soil retention of nitrogen in the form of nitrate is an underappreciated mechanism that buffers ground and surface waters from the negative effects of nitrogen runoff. The magnitude of this adsorption capacity is not known, but will likely determine the time frame over which intensive Amazon cropping can occur without nutrient pollution of surface waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/10/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marcia&nbsp;N&nbsp;Macedo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257944/1257944_10282945_1515594727376_Streamdischagemeasurement--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257944/1257944_10282945_1515594727376_Streamdischagemeasurement--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stream discharge measurement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1257944/1257944_10282945_1515594727376_Streamdischagemeasurement--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stream discharge measurement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Leonardo Maracahipes and Aline Castro make a measurement of discharge in a cropland stream at Tanguro Ranch.
