This course includes both inter-campus collaborative hands-on laboratory and team project experiences. \r\n\r\nThe project is addressing the needs of three very different populations of students: (i) the traditional engineering students attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) main campus; (ii) students enrolled in the pre-engineering program at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) campus in Juneau; and (iii) students attending an Alaska Native serving community campus in rural Alaska. The delivery of an exemplary, financially responsible, engineering education in each of these communities has unique challenges, including cost and availability of an instructor, cost and availability of laboratory facilities, diversity of students' prior knowledge and cultural experiences, and variety of students' learning styles. \r\n\r\nThe project has three goals:\r\nGoal 1: Deliver a hands-on electrical engineering lab course to place-bound pre-engineering and Alaska Native serving community campuses in Alaska synchronously with the identical course delivered face-to-face on the main engineering campus at UAF. \r\nGoal 2: Restructure the lab component of the class to require inter-campus collaboration between the students through data sharing and discussions in the hands-on laboratories and team projects. \r\nGoal 3: Develop expertise in Engineering Education through detailed assessment and evaluation of the engagement and learning of students, both those participating face-to-face and via distance. \r\n\r\nThe team is studying the effectiveness of inter-campus collaboration to improve both retention and academic achievement across three Alaska communities. This is the first hands-on engineering lab course delivered by distance in Alaska; therefore, it is transforming the way engineering education is delivered in the state. \r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE \r\nThe project is directly impacting the availability of engineering curriculum for the geographically dispersed student population in Alaska, especially the Alaska Native communities in rural Alaska. The project is creating a successful \"blueprint\" for development and assessment of distance-delivered laboratory-based courses, particularly for inter-campus collaborations. The effort is transforming the educational experience of the often-isolated, place-bound students in rural communities - through building their social capital and connecting them to a larger learning community. This inter-campus collaboration is generating a deeper discussion of variations and outliers in measurements and providing experiences that are more reflective of the global work environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA state where non-residents in STEM-related jobs account for 16% of the total STEM workforce needs either to provide access to STEM education for its own population or accept the economic drain from the state.  For a state whose population density is about one per square mile (national average is closer to 80) and whose student population is frequently place-bound in remote villages, providing that access presents unique challenges. \n\n \n\nIn this project we transformed a freshman electrical engineering lab course into an interactive hybrid teaching model with inter-campus collaborative hands-on laboratory and team project experiences.  Specifically, we (i) created the online course structure and online instructional materials; (ii) developed a methodology for collaborative labs; (iii) developed strategies to enforce student engagement of the material; (iv) developed appropriate in-class activities that would clarify and reinforce module content; and (v) performed formative and summative assessments of the course material and course structure.\n\n \n\nBy all accounts the transformed class exceeded expectations.  In terms of learning gains, there was approximately 15-20% increase in the number of students achieving an ?A? (greater than 90%) on exams.  Analysis of the written lab reports showed that the students were more reflective and analyzed their data more critically.  We believe that the success was due in large part to the collaborative nature of the in-class activities (see quotes below), hands-on laboratories and team project.    \n\n \n\nI greatly enjoyed the [collaborative] classroom technique.  I think it has brought me closer to my classmates and my professor&hellip; I very strongly support the system of having partners to work with in class.  Often times I would teach my partner how to do the problems and help them understand while [other] times I got help from my partner and they helped me understand.  If it were not for this system I believe I would have spent a lot of wasted time trying to teach myself the class content.  ~Spring 2015\n\n \n\nSometimes I did not understand a concept very well after watching the lecture, but the in-class activities almost always effectively reinforced the lecture content. ~Spring 2015\n\n \n\nOur class time was spent more productively because we already were familiar with the material.
