 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work develops a novel receiver methodology to integrate signal detection and forward\r\nerror correction in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications and various diversity\r\ntransmissions. Moving beyond traditional approaches relying on belief-propagation, this\r\ninvestigation into the rather classic open problem of integrated signal detection and decoding\r\ninvolves novel joint optimization formulations that incorporate binary field parity constraints\r\nimposed by the low-density parity check within maximum likelihood detection frameworks for\r\nunified optimization. This novel framework is general and encompasses a number of practical\r\ntransmission models, including distributed antennas, opportunistic cooperative networking,\r\nand signal retransmission as well as their integrations. This project has broad impacts on\r\nengineering, education, and society. Its success can lead to new research directions, new\r\ntools, and results to help advance other science and engineering fields.\r\n\r\nFocusing on multicarrier MIMO signal reception, the investigators will develop and optimize\r\nintegrated receivers for important wireless network diversities including distributed\r\ntransmissions, cooperative MIMO, and hybrid-ARQ retransmission systems. The new design\r\nmethodology emphasizes integration of multiple constraints from incompatible fields. By\r\nreformulating and relaxing joint detection and decoding problems into convex optimization, the\r\ninvestigators will design high performance receivers that are efficient and are robust to various\r\nforms of uncertainties in channel state information. Such a novel approach to receiver design\r\nintegration represents a fundamental and practical design paradigm that can fully utilize\r\nvarious a priori signaling and code constraints for joint detection and decoding against channel\r\ndistortions and other non-idealities to achieve high performance, efficiency, and reliability. The\r\nresearch findings can contribute practically to improvement of future wireless services and\r\nbroaden their applications in many practical fields where quality, efficiency, and distributivity\r\nconcerns are paramount.",
