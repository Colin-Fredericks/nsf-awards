 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to join the University of Minnesota (MIN) and the Yale University (YU) herbaria to the North American Lichens and Bryophytes: Sensitive Indicators of Environmental Quality and Change Thematic Collections Network (LBCC TCN).  A total of 91,300 lichen and bryophyte specimens will be imaged and georeferenced. Historical records of lichens and bryophytes, along with geographic coordinates of collecting localities, are ideally suited for investigating a variety of questions related to global environmental change. The collections included in this PEN are each important regional repositories of North American specimens, and digitizing them will fill a considerable gap in the TCN's goal of digitizing nearly all lichen and bryophyte specimens in North America and add historically important specimens.\r\n\r\nData resulting from this project will be of immediate use to scientists who study how ecosystems respond to climate change and who use lichens and bryophytes as indicators of air quality. Societal benefits of this work include improved understanding of what causes ecosystem change and how environmental change may affect human health, our economy, and our environment. This project introduces a new generation of students to museum collections by offering internships to high school students of diverse backgrounds and by involving undergraduates and graduate students in project activities. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through iDigBio.org.",

Specimens of mosses, liverworts, and hornworts (collectively called bryophytes) and lichens are ideally suited for investigating a variety of questions related to global environmental change. Living lichens and bryophytes are sensitive to subtle environmental changes of many kinds, both physical and chemical. Because lichen and bryophyte specimens are associated with information about where and when they were collected, these specimens provide a kind of temporal and spatial record of environmental change over more than two centuries. Capturing this temporal and spatial information into digital form, a process called digitization, and then sharing this data online promises to greatly increase the utilization of these specimens and provide a large, highly accessible data set to detect and document global environmental change.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of this project was to partner with the <em>North American Lichens and Bryophytes: Sensitive Indicators of Environmental Quality and Change</em> Thematic Collections Network (TCN) by contributing tens of thousands of digitized North American lichen and bryophyte records to that TCN&rsquo;s data set. To this end, the Yale University Herbarium digitized over 42,000 lichen and bryophyte specimens, capturing images of specimen data labels and recording into a database information about when and where (including geographic coordinates and associated metadata) the specimens were collected. The resulting images and data were shared on the internet through various data sharing websites utilized by scientists, conservationists, educators, and the general public. These websites include the iDigBio portal (portal.iDigBio.org) and the Bryophyte (http://bryophyteportal.org/portal/) and Lichen (http://lichenportal.org/portal/) Consortium portals.</p>\n<p>This results of this project will advance knowledge and understanding across different disciplines.&nbsp;Digitizing Yale&rsquo;s lichen and bryophyte collections filled a considerable gap in the TCN's goal of digitizing all lichen and bryophyte specimens collected in North America.

In addition, the overall project will significantly benefit many other areas of scientific research by helping to make available lichen and bryophyte data from an entire continent in an electronic format that is globally accessible.
