The past several decades have seen numerous significant advances in statistical theory and methodology for the analysis of data from experimental and observational studies.  These developments have had a profound impact on statistical practice.  The conference features presentations by leaders in the development of statistical theory and methods in areas such as censored time-to-event data, missing data, longitudinal data, and causal inference. \r\n\r\nThe conference will serve as a forum for discussion of developments in statistical methodology and theory that have propelled advances in research in the health, biological, epidemiological, social, and economic sciences.  The conference offers a perfect opportunity for junior researchers to gain a valuable perspective on emerging trends and the opportunity to interact with senior and mid-career level leaders responsible for past and present advances.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/events/2013_tsiatis_symposium/",
