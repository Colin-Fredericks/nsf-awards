 "awd_abstract_narration": "A microlab is a form of active learning where students are asked to complete a 5-10 minute conceptual or programming activity during lecture. These labs can be delivered on tablets, laptops or desktops. In a logical microlab, students are asked to solve a conceptual problem by arranging and connecting on-screen icons and submitting their solutions to an automated grading system (the exploration phase of the microlab learning cycle).  Then the instructor helps students discover an algorithm to solve the problem (the invention phase). In the application phase, students are asked to implement this algorithm by dragging and dropping program statements, known as code magnets, to form a method that is then compiled and tested. This approach had been evaluated over the last two years by an independent evaluator and proved to be both educationally effective and popular with students.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration among three universities: Appalachian State University, SUNY Stony Brook, and UNC Greensboro. The goals are (1) expand the development of microlabs as an effective form of active learning and (2) in workshops organized by the collaborative universities, train other faculty at regional universities to use existing microlabs and develop new microlabs. Independent assessment of learning outcomes is continuing for these new activities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit includes further development of the microlab approach and expanded application to new courses in the computer science curriculum. Broader impact involves the development of cost-effective on-site workshops to train other faculty to adopt the microlab approach and develop new microlabs, implementation of a microlab repository for sharing these materials nationwide, and development of a proactive model using small stipends to encourage new contributions to the repository.",

There are three phases: Exploration (students explore a particular problem and see whether they can discover a solution), Invention (using student input the instructor helps develop a formal solution to the problem), and Application (students solve similar problems in the same domain). For several topics, particularly in data structures, microlabs can be organized into a learning cycle, as shown in Image6. The example shown is building a binary tree using the preorder and inorder traversals. The logical microlab (Image 2) is the exploration phase and the code magnet microlab (Image3) is the application phase.  Knowledge retention by students can be measured by asking similar problems with different data on an exam.  Application can be expanded by asking students to write a program to solve a similar problem, such as building a binary tree based on the inorder and postorder traversals.\n\nMicrolabs have been tested in the classroom at seven universities (including two HBCU), three community colleges, and one high school. The success rates during one semester at Appalachian State are typical.  In four sections of an introductory programming course taught by three instructors the success rate for 647 attempted labs was 89.7% correct.

Students commented that Microlabs \"helped me figure out the logic behind the code without having to worry about syntax\", \"reinforce concepts that we are learning\", and \"helps you recognize bugs in other people?s code\".\n\nSince dissemination is critically important, nine workshops have been presented so that other faculty can adopt the microlab approach and help develop new microlabs.  Faculty members were allowed to bring one student with them to the workshop.  A total of 86 faculty members and 48 students attended these workshops from 30 different institutions.  The evaluations of these workshops were highly positive.  Additionally papers have been published and presented at international and national conferences on using microlabs to promote active learning throughout the computer science curriculum.  Microlabs continue to be used at five different universities in the Fall 2016 semester after support recently expired.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lixin Fu"
