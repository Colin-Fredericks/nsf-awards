 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students majoring in the sciences and mathematics.   The project is open to all students who meet academic and financial eligibility requirements and emphasizes supporting students, especially first-generation college students and members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities.  Students are being attracted to the scholarships through family-based recruitment practices, collaboration with local high schools, and partnerships with local nonprofit agencies. Retention and graduation rates are being increased by a summer bridge program, an orientation program, supplemental instruction in key STEM courses, intensive academic advising, and summer research and internship opportunities. Professional success is encouraged through regular group meetings, individualized portfolios, and career services.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education.   Results of this program are being disseminated through professional conferences and higher education publications and shared with partner high schools. Successful support structures built for these students are being incorporated into the college's programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo help them achieve success in a STEM discipline, twelve first-generation college students were offered four-year Goshen College Leaf Scholarships.  In addition, they were provided an orientation program, exposed to community building and leadership programs, provided supplemental instruction in key courses, participated in seminars in learning strategies and career possibilities, and engaged in internships, teaching or lab assistantships, and volunteer activities.  Seven of these first-generation students are members of racial or ethnic minority groups.  Five graduated with STEM majors, one graduated with an Exercise Science major, two will be graduating next year with STEM majors, two remained STEM majors for four years but have not obtained their degrees, and two transferred to other schools.  Although the students in this cohort model had generally weaker college preparation than other students majoring in STEM disciplines (with respect to SAT/ACT Math scores, high school GPA, and participation in AP/IB/Dual Credit courses), retention in STEM and graduation rates are higher than with other STEM students.\n\nTo make possible their initial or continued study of a STEM discipline, an additional nine students received Leaf Scholarships for one or two semesters without the additional benefits (listed previously) provided by this NSF award to the twelve students in the cohort model.  This group of students was stronger than average STEM students and only four are members of racial or ethnic minority groups.   Since we can only look at a one-year impact and seven had already been in college for at least one year, it is perhaps not surprising that one graduated and plans to pursue a career in STEM and the remaining eight students still plan to return next year to continue pursuing their degree and career in a STEM discipline.\n\nGoshen College has been attracting a more racially and ethnically diverse student body over the last ten years (e.g., 26% currently identify as Latinx) and will continue to do so in the next ten years.  Many of the programmatic opportunities provided to the relatively diverse twelve Leaf Scholars that had a positive impact on their retention have been integrated into the educational experience for all Goshen College students.  In this way, the grant will have a lasting effect on future students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Housman"
