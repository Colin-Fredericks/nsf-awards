 "awd_abstract_narration": "Verification is currently a major bottleneck in the design of the\r\nhardware and software systems society depends on. Design errors\r\ncan lead to recalls, software crashes, cyber attacks, and even\r\nthe loss of life.  A fundamental approach for identifying and\r\nfixing design errors is to use formal verification, which checks\r\nwhether a set of system properties holds across all possible\r\nsystem behaviors.  Unfortunately, current algorithms suffer from\r\npoor scalability and cannot be directly applied to modern\r\ndesigns. This drawback is currently addressed with the use of\r\nmanual abstractions that in essence hide irrelevant\r\nimplementation details, thereby reducing the size of formulas to\r\nbe analyzed.  Besides the manual effort involved, another\r\ndisadvantage of this approach is that it is very hard to\r\nguarantee that an abstraction is correct. The goal of the proposed\r\nresearch is to develop efficient methods for algorithmically\r\nbuilding provably correct abstractions, thereby drastically\r\nimproving the scalability of formal verification algorithms.\r\n\r\nOur approach to finding correct abstractions is based on the\r\nfollowing three ideas.  First, building an abstraction that is\r\ncorrect in a small subspace of the search space is easy. Second,\r\none can stitch together abstractions found for subspaces to\r\nproduce an abstraction for the entire subspace explored so far.\r\nThird, abstractions built for explored subspaces may hold in many\r\nsubspaces that have not been visited yet. This re-usability of\r\nabstractions makes our approach extremely powerful in identifying\r\nirrelevant parts of formulas.  From a theoretical point of view,\r\nthe proposed research will lead to a better understanding of\r\nabstractions and to the development of new formal verification\r\nalgorithms. From a practical point of view, it will result in the\r\ncreation of various kinds of tools including SAT-solvers and\r\n model checkers that will boost the scalability of formal\r\nverification.",
