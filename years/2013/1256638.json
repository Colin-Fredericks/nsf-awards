 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a critical need for accurate patient diagnosis in the development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, and in patient treatment.  The high variability of patients selected for dementia clinical trials, including misdiagnosis, has been a significant contributor to the high failure rates of these trials. The diagnostic under development in this grant would provide an important way to reduce misdiagnosis and patient variability. A main objective of Phase II is to expand the glucose metabolism dementia diagnostic developed in Phase I to be capable of analyzing amyloid PET images and structural magnetic resonance images (MRI), and to combine data from one or more of these imaging modalities into an optimal diagnostic and prognostic assessment.  The research will include the development, refinement and testing of: single-modality analysis methods that identify the type of dementia that a patient has, single-modality analysis methods that place the patient along a scale of disease severity,  methods that combine and optimize information from multiple imaging modalities, and automated software to conduct these analyses.  In addition, reports will be further developed and refined with feedback from physicians and pharmaceutical partners to clearly communicate results.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to address a major barrier of patient variability in achieving successful clinical trials, thus increasing the opportunity to find effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias.  More than 6 million persons in the U.S. alone are affected by these dementias, with a societal cost estimated at more than $400 billion.  This population is rapidly growing as the population ages, and the need to effectively identify and treat patients is urgent.  The use of the technology to screen patients for clinical trials and stratify them for analysis is expected to be of immense value to pharmaceutical companies and is an initial commercial opportunity.  Already, the developments of Phase I are in use for projects with two such companies. The ability to accurately diagnose patients will help to address the need to correctly treat these patients.  The project will result in job creation as the initial service model and subsequent product model are implemented.  Finally, by allowing characterization of the subjects in clinical trials, this project will aid in the scientific understanding of the progression of disease and its relationship to symptoms and response to therapy.",

This advance addresses the need for better and earlier identification of disease, for use in treatment development and in clinical diagnosis. This need is urgent, as the Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease population exceeds 5 million persons at a societal cost of over $200 Billion in the U.S. alone, and is projected to affect over 100 million persons worldwide by 2050.&nbsp; Misdiagnosis rates are 20 to nearly 50% in some clinics, and diagnosis in early stages of cognitive impairment is not currently available. Clinical trials have consistently failed, in part due to the inclusion of patients who do not have the target disease, and by the wide variability in patient rates of decline that prevents detection of treatment effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the technical foundation for the diagnostic product, ADMdx has applied multivariate machine learning technology to a comprehensive set of image data obtained through public and private collaborative sources to develop pattern recognition algorithms that can detect and differentiate dementias and stage of disease. These imaging classifiers can work with one or more types of brain scans that a patient may have, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), FDG PET, or amyloid PET (amyloid is a hallmark pathology of AD). The classifiers have been trained to recognize the &ldquo;signature&rdquo; patterns of reduced neuronal function and tissue shrinkage (atrophy) that are associated with different types of dementia, and to measure the accumulation of amyloid. These analyses are used to generate a report summarizing the regional abnormalities found in each scan, and translated to a pattern match with one or more types of dementia as well as a severity level. ADMdx has shown that the numeric value that quantifies severity level on the Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease pathway correlates with subsequent rates of decline in cognitive and functional measures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An example of one of the patterns that differentiates Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease from another type of dementia is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows a pattern of decreases and preservation in regional glucose metabolism (relative to the whole brain level) that are increasingly expressed in an FDG PET scan as patients progress from a cognitively normal state without amyloid pathology to AD dementia. These patterns of loss in neuronal activity and tissue can be difficult to discern visually, but they are detected and discriminated by the machine learning classifiers. ADMdx has demonstrated the ability to detect emerging disease even in persons who are cognitively normal, with any one or a combination of FDG PET, MRI, and amyloid PET imaging. The ability to obtain information regarding amyloid and tau (another hallmark pathology of AD) using only an MRI scan and non-imaging variables provides an efficient, cost-effective approach that can then be augmented with PET scan information. Classifiers were also developed that could provide information regarding neurodegeneration and disease severity using images acquired during the first few minutes following injection of the PET tracer for an amyloid scan, adding to the amyloid burden information obtained from later portions of the scan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the grant objectives, ADMdx also developed PETMAX&trade; software that enables the automated quality control, processing, and analysis of images, and the generation of a diagnostic report. ADMdx also expanded its proprietary PipelineMAX&trade; software platform, which allows rapid, flexible configuration and batch processing of the many complex steps involved in image processing and analysis, with a complete audit trail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ADMdx has commercialized this technology in services provided to pharmaceutical companies that are conducting clinical trials in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other disorders of the brain.
