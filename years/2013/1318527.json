 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida (UF) is awarded a grant to purchase a state-of-the art solid-state semiconductor DNA sequencer for the Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience and a new high bandwidth internet connection to the main UF campus.  Situated some 90 miles from the main campus in Gainesville, the Whitney lab is a leader in utilizing marine biodiversity to address fundamental problems in biomedical science.   The new equipment will allow the nine resident research labs as well as visiting scientists from around the world to utilize their existing strengths in cellular and molecular approaches to understanding neural systems and development.  Researchers at Whitney utilize a variety of different animals found in local waters to exploit their favorable properties (such as the large size, optical properties, and fecundity) to address important issues in sensory biology, the neural control of rhythmic activity, circadian behavior, and embryonic development at cellular resolution.  A number of pioneering molecular techniques of individual cells and total genome sequencing have been initiated by Whitney researchers.  \r\n\r\nThe capacity to perform \"third\" generation sequencing at the interface between marine and terrestrial environments at the Whitney lab allows the ability to study organisms at the molecular level in their natural environment.  As a research facility of UF,  Whitney trains undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students throughout the year, as well as REU students in the summer (for the last 26 years!).  In addition, Whitney has a number of STEM programs for K-12 students in the St. Johns and Flagler county areas and a highly successful ?Evenings at Whitney? adult seminar series in our 260 seat Center for Marine Studies building that brings exciting benefits of scientific research to our local community.  The high bandwith \"Lambda Rail\" internet connection will allow us not only to share our research data with colleagues around the world, but leverages the high performance computing capabilities located at the UF main campus in Gainesville for data analysis.  More information about the Whitney Lab can be found on its website (http://www.whitney.ufl.edu/).",
