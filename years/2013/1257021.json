 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals communicate with each other using specific behaviors that are controlled by the interaction of muscles, hormones, and the central nervous system. However, it is not yet known whether species that exhibit the same patterns of behavior have similar muscular, hormonal, and neural traits (collectively referred to as mechanisms of behavior), or if different combinations of these traits can produce the same behaviors. This project uses a group of 26 lizard species in the genus Anolis to determine the mechanisms that underlie two social behaviors: communication with other lizards through the extension of a throat fan, and copulation. Because these behaviors are simple, but can be directly compared across multiple species, this study allows a clear and comprehensive assessment of the interactions between the neuromuscular traits that control behavior in all vertebrates. This study is comprised of two components, both of which aim to determine the evolutionary relationships between social behaviors and their mechanisms. First, by combining detailed observations of the animals' natural behavior with biochemical assays that measure the neuromuscular traits of the animals, this project will determine if species that live in similar habitats have similar behaviors and their underlying mechanisms, and if species in different habitats exhibit different behaviors and behavioral mechanisms. Next, a laboratory experiment will manipulate rates of social behavior in males of four species by altering their levels of testosterone. This experiment will determine whether hormone-enhanced behaviors are associated with the same combination of neuromuscular traits across species. Overall, this project will provide intensive, hands-on research experiences for 12 undergraduate students, and will form the basis of a program for fifth grade science teachers and their students in urban public schools in San Antonio. These efforts will focus on providing accessible training in the science of behavior and physiology to a diverse community.\r\n\r\nData will be made available:  EthoBank (http://www.indiana.edu/~ethobank/index.html) and lizardbase(http://lizardbase.org/pages/index.html)",

To understand how variation in muscle composition supports a diversity of animal behaviors, we studied the characteristics of two muscles in a group of 30 anole lizard species. These muscles were the ceratohyoid, a jaw muscle that moves lizard throat fans called dewlaps, and the retractor penis magnus, a tail muscle that moves the male copulatory organs called hemipenes. Because both of these muscles are only used to move a specific body part, we could measure the contractions of the muscles by observing the lizards' behaviors in their natural habitats.</p>\n<p>We found that species with larger dewlaps and hemipenes have larger fibers (the cells that compose a muscle) in the muscles that move those structures. Yet surprisingly, we found that the size of the muscle fibers was not related to how frequently the muscle was used or how long the muscle contraction was held. We also found that the metabolic types of muscle fibers were not associated with how these muscles were used in behavior. In addition, we measured proteins called androgen receptors in the muscle fibers to determine if muscles that were more sensitive to testosterone were used in behavior more frequently, and found that lizard species with smaller body sizes had more androgen receptors in their muscles. Finally, we performed an experiment to learn how testosterone influences the behavioral use of these muscles and their physiological characteristics, and learned that testosterone affects different muscle traits in different ways. Over five years, this grant supported the intensive research experiences of 20 diverse undergraduate students. To date, we have published 14 articles in scientific journals based on this work, and given 53 presentations at regional and national scientific conferences.</p>\n<p>Another primary goal of this grant was to use the results of our research to enhance elementary science education in San Antonio, Texas. We developed a weeklong summer workshop for elementary science teachers (Trinity University?s Science Teaching Institute), which was supported by this grant for four years. In this workshop, 54 San Antonio public school teachers gained a more in-depth understanding of the process of science, enhanced teaching skills, and connections to a network of scientists invested in education. To develop connections between scientists and schoolchildren, we also developed a popular blog for children (lizardsandfriends.org), on which we describe the lizards we study and what we learn about them in our research. Researchers from our lab also regularly visited elementary classrooms in San Antonio and near our Caribbean field sites to engage with children directly on topics including lizard diversity and animal behavior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/09/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michele&nbsp;A&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366753514_NOLAdewBlog--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366753514_NOLAdewBlog--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Male anole lizard displaying dewlap\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366753514_NOLAdewBlog--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Male anole lizard displaying dewlap\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Male Anolis carolinensis (green anole) lizard extending his throat fan (dewlap), a behavior controlled by the ceratohyoid muscle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo: Michele Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michele&nbsp;A&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Male anole lizard displaying dewlap</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366844877_IMG_0407--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366844877_IMG_0407--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Anole lizards copulating\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257021/1257021_10258365_1565366844877_IMG_0407--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Anole lizards copulating\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Anolis carolinensis (green anole) lizards copulating.
