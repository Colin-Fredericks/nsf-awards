 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work seeks to enable plug and play use of multiple platforms in the development of multi-robot teams that interact with human teams.  The research will develop a software engineering framework viewed as crucial for the proliferation of intelligent robots. The proposed approach will (i) Develop of a framework that allows quick integration of new robot designs into the robotic team; (ii) Develop a user-friendly human-team interface, (iii) Create methods to perform asset (robot) management, (iv) Software test to check the viability of the proposed solutions, and (v) Experimentally validate the system in real-world settings in consultation with center members.\r\n\r\nRobot teams have the potential for significant societal impact given their design and implementation can be made more efficient and low cost.  Interchangeable use of hardware and software to achieve a wide range of functions is critical to achieving this potential and the associated economic impact that will accompany it.   The proposed software framework for robotics is supported by the Industry Advisory Board and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio significantly through expansion into the area of robotic team system software engineering.  The research will impact and be used in the center?s annual robotics camp and other outreach activities.\r\n",
