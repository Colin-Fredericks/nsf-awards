This is the largest American meeting focused in the area of membrane science and engineering.  Students will have opportunities to present their work, meet other scientists and engineers from around the world with similar interests, and see state-of-the-art presentations from other research groups working in this area.\r\n\r\nThis funding will be used to help disseminate knowledge about state-of-the-art research in membrane science and engineering from around the world to students. This is the premier meeting for students and engineers in the American membrane community, and this technology represents one of the fastest growing separations techniques. It is widely used in the chemical, petrochemical, food processing, food packaging, medical and pharmaceutical industries. The most respected and accomplished membrane scientists and engineers from around the world will participate in this meeting. Students will also have extensive opportunities to network with potential employers and with students and faculty from other research groups with similar interests. Society will benefit from this activity by having better trained, more knowledgeable graduate students prepared to push the frontiers of this unique enabling technology in a wide variety of practical applications.",
