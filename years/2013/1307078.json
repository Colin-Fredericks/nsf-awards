 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program (Division of Chemistry), Professor R. Kenneth Marcus, his collaborators and their students at Clemson University are developing and characterizing capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as stationary phases for rapid processing of biomacromolecules. C-CP materials are amenable to a wide range of column formats (microbore to preparative) and offer advantages for macromolecular separations relative to traditional porous-bead, membrane, and monolithic stationary phases, including low flow resistance, minimization of size-exclusion effects, much higher mass transfer rates, and high mobile phase velocities (not necessarily volume flow rates) and gradient rates without sacrificing chromatographic performance. Proposed studies are directed at exploiting the basic characteristics of C-CP fiber columns to affect highly productive and selective separations in the realm of protein analytics. This work is necessarily interdisciplinary, involving cooperation between analytical and biochemistries, chemical engineering, and textile science researchers. A two-pronged approach will be taken. The first research area will focus on modification of surface chemistries to affect high levels of selectivity. The modifications will be evaluated not only for their chemical selectivity, but also the ligand utilization efficiency, susceptibility to non-specific binding, and robustness in terms of process cycling (including caustic clean in place procedures). In all cases, performance metrics will be directly compared to columns packed with commercially available stationary phases. The second research area looks beyond chromatographic column structures, involving the characterization and optimization of the hydrodynamic aspects of depletion/capture columns and micropipette tip constructs and how they affect performance of in-line and discrete sample protein processing, respectively.\r\n\r\nJust as scientists catalog all the genes in an organism's DNA to study its biological function, they are also developing protein analytics to eventually be able to catalog the varying collections of proteins an organism uses to carry out its functions.  Complete, accurate protein catalogs are critical to the development of more effective pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tools and the advance of molecular medicine.  They rely heavily on efficient separations technology because biological samples are so complex.  This work conducted by Prof. Marcus will advance protein analytics by developing separations technology that can analyze more complex samples more accurately in less time.  The studies involve a collaborative effort between research groups from the Department of Chemistry and the School of Materials Science and Engineering, both of which are affiliated with the Clemson University Center for Advanced Engineering of Fibers and Films (CAEFF).  Collaborations with federal laboratories are also planned.  Successful completion of the work may lead to new commercial ventures in the textile and pharmaceutical industries in South Carolina and elsewhere. CAEFF programs expose graduate students to science and research philosophies across the science/engineering interface. The low cost and simplicity of constructing C-CP fiber columns will allow their use in newly designed undergraduate and graduate laboratory experiments illustrating the basic principles of protein chromatography.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Different from many other areas of separation science, protein chromatography is faced with challenges that extend across volume scales ranging from microliters to kiloliters.  On the lower end of the scale are those separations that are generally followed by some spectrometric determination of identity and quantify, fitting within the realm of science of \"proteomics\" and its related \"omics\" cousins.  On the upper end of the scale are those separations that are part of the downstream processing that is integral to the isolation of protein therapeutics.  In this application, using monoclonal antibodies as the most common targets, active proteins must be isolated from culture \"soups\" where bacteria and mammalian cells are trained to produce the desired proteins.  In this case, the matrix consists of salts, small organic metabolites, genetic material, and hundreds of other host cell proteins.  Clearly, the diversity in volume scales, processing time scales, supporting hardware, and processing costs are tremendous challenges for analytical chemists, biochemists, and chemical engineers, respectively.\n\n     Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are a unique family of materials that this laboratory seeks to intelligently implement across the spectrum of protein chromatography.  C-CP fibers are melt-extruded from commodity polymers including polypropylene, polyester, and nylon 6.  The fibers have a unique physical structure that includes 8 parallel channels along the fiber periphery.  The fibers are typically ~50 &mu;m in diameter, with channel sizes of 5-20 &mu;m.  Columns are packed in such a way that they run parallel down the column, providing thousands of parallel channels of 2-5 &mu;m diameter.  The resulting bed is extremely permeable, allowing very high volume flow rates with very low backpressures in comparison to packed-bed arrangements.  The ease of flow is complemented by extremely high mass transfer rates, allowing separations at linear velocities of up to 100 mm s-1, without sacrifice of resolution.  Studies in this project period demonstrated the capacity to affect rapid analytical-scale separations with coupling to ESI-MS detection.  Detailed fundamental studies of protein loading provided insights into the adsorption processes, and very favorable performance benchmarking with common preparative-scale columns.\n\n     To complement the efforts in characterizing and taking advantage of the physical attributes of C-CP fiber columns, the majority of efforts were directed at understanding and implementing chemical strategies to affect greater chemical selectivity in protein separations.  There is a fair amount of selectivity that can be dialed-in through the choice of the base fiber.  Beyond that, there is a rich tool box of chemistries that can be affected on-column.  In this period, functional ligands were affixed to the fiber supports through adsorption, room temperature coupling, and microwave-assisted grafting.   In the first case, protein A, which is the most common ligand used to isolate IgG-type antibodies, is simply passed through polypropylene columns and captured via adsorption.  High levels of selectivity and throughput were realized, with separations tuned towards both the analytical and preparative scales.  To this end, a new relationship with Merck Co. looks to implement the fibers in at-reactor anti-body characterization.  In an effort to attain greater capacity for anionic protein separations, a novel coupling chemistry was developed to affix polyethyleneimine to polyester surfaces.  Finally, a completely novel family of coupling chemistries was initiated, involving a simple (residential) microwave-assisted grafting to nylon 6 fiber surfaces.  Initial efforts yielded extremely high densities of -COOH and -SO3H surfaces to affect weak and strong cation exchange protein separations.  Other metal-ligand functionalities are also under development.\n\n     While the research accomplished under the grant is anticipated to have many practical outlets, the final, most important, outcome of the project was in the area of human capital development.  NSF funding was acknowledged in publications and conference presentations that were part of four Ph.D. and four M.S. projects.  Two current Ph.D. students have published works supported by this NSF grant.  All of the Ph.D. graduates are employed, one at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, one at Bristol Meyers Squibb, and the other two at contract laboratories serving the pharmaceutical sector. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R.
