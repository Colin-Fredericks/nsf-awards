 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an indispensable tool for determining the structure of molecules.  In this project, supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Yoshitaka Ishii of the University of Illinois at Chicago and his research group will establish a new framework of next-generation NMR spectroscopy for biomoleculces and materials in solids, which is generally called solid-state NMR (SSNMR).  The proposed work would aim to increase the speeds of the data collection 50-6000 fold over a traditional method by integrating advanced methods such as 1H detection, novel isotope labeling, and paramagnetic doping into a non-traditional SSNMR approach using an ultra high magnetic field and very fast magic angle spinning.  The second component of the research involves SSNMR analysis of peptides and proteins during solid-phase peptide synthesis, which reveals the structural changes of the protein during the reactions.  The third component is to examine graphene/graphite based nano materials, in particular, chemical reactions of graphene oxide and graphite oxide and the interactions of H2O with porous grapheme-based systems. \r\n\r\nIshii's research will advance NMR technology applications to a broader range of insoluble proteins and non-crystalline materials, which cannot be analyzed by other tools such as x-ray crystallography. Advances in the Ishii group research will likely have impacts in the many venues of NMR based technology, including nanomaterials analysis and peptide science.  Professor Ishii will integrate his research into his educational activities by establishing a new graduate course on solid-state NMR with hands-on experiments. Professor Ishii will also incorporate a demo of a simple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment into molecular diffusion experiments with NMR field gradient in undergraduate labs in order to discuss the connection of NMR with the MRI technology used for medical diagnostics.  Finally, Professor Ishii will recruit undergraduate researchers through Summer Research Opportunities for Undergraduates Program (SROP) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which emphasizes the diversity in research-based undergraduate education.",
