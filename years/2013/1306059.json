 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrating behavior, engineering and mathematics: Applying modern network theory to social transmission of parasites\r\n\r\nGaps in the understanding of parasite transmission and social networks exist due to 1) lack of experimentation 2) difficulty obtaining accurate measures of social interactions and 3) analytical challenges associated with robust statistical comparisons of networks.  This research involves describing social networks in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) using digital transceiver devices to characterize fine-scale social interactions among individuals belonging to independent subpopulations.  Parasites will be experimentally removed from half the individuals per network and sampled later to measure recolonization of directly transmitted parasites relative to social network properties calculated based on digitally recorded contact rates between members of the tagged populations.  A second experiment will manipulate the network rather than the parasites, through alteration of host ventral plumage color, a trait known to affect physiology and social behavior. \r\n\r\nThere is growing recognition of the importance of individual-level heterogeneity in host behavior in the context of parasite transmission, and this experimental approach is a powerful way to understand relative contributions of social network measure on parasite transmission as well as understanding how features of morphology and physiology influence position in social networks.  Motivated by career goals in undergraduate research and education, the inclusion of University of Colorado-Boulder undergraduate students in this research is a high priority, especially participation by students typically underrepresented in the field.  The research will enhance the University's infrastructure by establishing collaboration between the Applied Math and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology departments.  Outreach associated with this project includes working with citizen scientists through the Swallow Surveillance program.",

Morphological (body size, plumage color) and physiological (testosterone, corticosterone) traits are often predictive of reproductive performance, and researchers make inferences about how behavior operates to shape those relationships. However, it is rare that we understand exactly how morphological and physiological traits translate to reproductive success, as this involves detailed information about individual behavior, and its physiological basis, that can be difficult to obtain. To meet this challenge, I deployed proximity loggers on breeding barn swallows (<em>Hirundo rustica erythrogaster</em>) to test how experimentally manipulating male ventral plumage color affects social network position, reproductive success, and aspects of physiology including testosterone, corticosterone (stress hormone), oxidative stress, gut microbial diversity, and antioxidants. Proximity loggers recorded close proximity interactions for several days both before and after half of the males in the network had their ventral plumage experimentally darkened. Physiological data were collected pre- and post-manipulation for nearly all individuals. I had previously shown in year 1 of the fellowship that ventral color, a known sexual signal in North American barn swallows, correlates with male interactivity with females. Our experimental data show that a male&rsquo;s interactivity with females changed proportionally to his change in plumage color: darkened males experienced an increase in interactions with females &ndash; especially with their social mates. Interestingly, changes in male-male interactions and changes in physiology were not directly related to the phenotype manipulation. I also demonstrated that gut microbial diversity was related to social contact. Male swallows that were more interactive with other males in the contact network had lower gut microbial diversity and females who had more contacts with males had higher diversity. One explanation for this finding involves the positive relationship I observed in males between social interactivity and the stress hormone, corticosterone. High levels of stress have been associated with low gut microbial diversity in studies of lab animals.</p>\n<p>I have published two papers so far from this research, with another in later stage preparation and at least two more in earlier stages of preparation.

I worked closely with a graduate student in the first year of this fellowship and we have co-authored two papers together on this work.
