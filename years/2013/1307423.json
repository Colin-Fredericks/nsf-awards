 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program explores two of the primary noise sources in Advanced LIGO and other gravitational wave interferometers: upconversion noise and coating thermal noise.  Coating thermal noise can be reduced by understanding and minimizing the mechanical loss in the mirror materials.  Traditional high reflectivity coatings are multilayers of dielectric material, usually amorphous metal-oxides, with alternating high and low index.  The materials that comprise the high-index layers are the primary source of mechanical loss; the low-index material is fused silica, which has an anomalously low loss among amorphous dielectric materials. In this research program, the PI seeks to develop a stabilized, high index material with a coefficient of thermal expansion matched to the low index material, so that the loss of the composite coating can be reduced through high temperature annealing.  In addition, crystalline coatings, such as Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs), have been shown to have a mechanical loss about a factor 10 lower than most amorphous dielectric coatings.  The AlGaAs coating could be developed as mirror materials for the 1.5 micron lasers planned for third generation detectors.  However, current samples have been limited to the centimeter scale.  This research program will explore the source of mechanical loss in these crystalline coatings including any issues related to the scaling and application of the coatings for large optics.  Finally, upconversion noise is the coupling of low frequency noise, primarily seismic noise, into the detection band of the interferometer.  Upconversion noise can be difficult to characterize because the noise peak is located at the sum or difference of the frequencies of the coupled mechanisms.  This research program will develop a data analysis tool that will use bicoherence, the higher order form of coherence, to determine the sources  of the upconverted noise.  \r\n\r\nCoating thermal noise is the leading noise source in the central frequency band of Advanced LIGO and is a primary limit to overall detector sensitivity. Reducing coating thermal noise leads to a direct increase in the detector sensitivity and a cubed increase in its expected event rate.  Thus even a small reduction in the noise is important. A significant improvement in coating noise will hasten the day when LIGO will make a direct detection of gravitational waves and launch the era of gravitational wave astronomy.  Beyond the study of gravitational waves, coating thermal noise has now become an important noise source in other areas of physics, including precision optics and in precision experiments that utilize microresonators.  Finally, with the lower noise floor of Advanced LIGO, upconversion is expected to be a much more prominent noise source than in Initial LIGO. The commissioning teams will welcome a tool that can identify these noise peaks with their source.  And since upconversion is a common noise problem within the precision physics community, the development of an effective tool could be useful well beyond the gravitational wave community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research landscape in gravitational wave physics experienced a fundamental shift in the past year when the LIGO-Virgo collaboration announced two separate detections of gravitational waves.  The detections proved that the interferometer design was a success, and they directly corroborated Einstein?s prediction of gravitational waves.  They also launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy.  Following the celebration of this historic milestone came the growing expectations for improving the detector?s sensitivity and increasing the rate of detections.  \n\nCoating thermal noise is the primary noise source in the most sensitive central region of the LIGO spectrum.  It is also the noise source where the method of lowering the noise is least understood.  The field of amorphous thin films has made very slow progress in understanding and reducing dissipation.  Now LIGO is demanding a reduction by a factor 4 within the next few years and by a factor 10 in the next several years.  \n\nHigh temperature annealing of stabilized amorphous coatings has the potential to meet the 4x reduction demanded for the upgrade to Advanced LIGO, known as A+.  High temperature annealing provides enough thermal energy to the coating molecules for them to reorient but not flow.  By slowly removing the heat, there is increased probability that the molecules will reconfigure into a lower energy state.  The higher peak temperatures increase the number of possible final states for the coating, while the slower cool down rates increase the probability that the coating will end up in the lowest attainable state.  As one raises the peak annealing temperature it is often necessary to stabilize the coating against crystallization or damaging thermal stresses.  Stabilization is accomplished by doping the coating with another material that prevents the formation of a crystalline lattice.  In the research funded by this grant, the PI has shown that zirconia can be stabilized by doping with silica.  The coating can then be annealed at 800 C which allows the mechanical loss to be reduced by a factor 4.  A pure silica coating will see an over 2x mechanical loss reduction when annealed at 900 C.  The PI has also measured the loss of a zirconia-doped tantala coating annealed at 800 C, though that analysis is not completed.\n\nThe reduction in mechanical loss indicates a structural change due to annealing.  By measuring the structure as a function of annealing, one might identify the dissipative mechanism. The PI supplies the annealed samples to colleagues from Stanford and the University of Glasgow who measure the distribution of bond lengths around each element using EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) Spectroscopy.  These measurements show that the bond distribution narrows with increased peak temperature, indicating that the coating becomes increasingly uniform.  A new set of measurements are examining the bond distribution as a function of depth in order to characterized the structure at the surface, which is known to have excess loss.\n\nOne can also design coatings from crystalline materials such as Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs).  The advantage of AlGaAs is that the material has a mechanical loss that meets the design criteria for future detectors.  However to form the mirror, the AlGaAs film must be adhered to the substrate.  Using the current application technique the substrate-coating interface has excess dissipation (friction) that generates unacceptable levels of noise.  In research funded by this grant, the PI and collaborators are in the process of refining the substrate surface conditions in order to minimize the interface losses.  Given the current progress, it appears that the interface losses could be solved in the next 6-12 months. An additional complication is that the current largest diameter for an AlGaAs coating is 20 cm.  That limit would have to at least double for AlGaAs coatings to be used in future detectors as currently designed.  That size issue will be explored in the subsequent grant.\n\nThe next generation of LIGO detectors, known as Voyager, is currently designed to have silicon mirror substrates and to operate cryogenically at 123 K.   A strong candidate for the mirror coating is a multilayer of amorphous silicon and silica.  The University of Glasgow is leading the research in a-Silicon coatings.  They are exploring manufacturing techniques to bring the optical absorption and mechanical loss below the design specifications.  The PI has collaborated on this research by measuring the room temperature losses.\n\nFinally, the PI is collaborating with colleagues at Stanford who are developing a conductive coating for use in the next upgrade of the interferometer mirrors.  Currently the mirrors are subject to stray charge from cosmic rays and other sources.  The Stanford group has developed a coating of Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide that appears suitable for the next detector upgrade.  The PI measured the mechanical loss for these coating samples.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven D Penn"
