The 2013 GRC will be an integrated educational forum for discussion of the most recent advances in polymer research across the broad horizon of the field. The conference will consist of nine technical sessions on polymer innovation in biomacromolecules, nanotechnology, catalysis, sustainable polymer chemistry, renewable technologies, and electronic, optical, stimuli-responsive, and biomedical materials. The invited speakers are widely recognized as leaders in their fields and will deliver focused lectures with broad scientific appeal. Special attention is devoted to the development of a diverse program including under-represented groups, international participation, and broad interdisciplinarity.\r\n\r\nA Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will again precede the GRC as in the last two conferences. The 2013 two-day seminar will include only graduate students and post-doctoral associates, who will give oral presentations and posters. All GRS attendees will be invited to remain for the subsequent GRC, where the GRS award speakers will present their talks to the entire audience.  Strong international participation will offer opportunities for global collaborations and discussions of emerging areas.",
