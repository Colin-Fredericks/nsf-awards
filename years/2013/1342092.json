 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an internationally renowned, well-attended conference involving topics of direct interest to the NSF, Universities, DOE, Air Force, and many others. The IEEE Pulsed Power and Plasma Science conference is a combination of the IEEE Pulsed Power Conference (PPC) and the International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS), sponsored by the Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society of the IEEE. The PPC is held every two years, and the ICOPS is held annually; the combined PPPS is held every 6 years. ICOPS has been held annually since 1974. Recent meetings were held in Edinburgh, Scotland (2012), Chicago, IL (2011), Norfolk VA (2010), San Diego CA (2009), Karlsruhe Germany (2008), Albuquerque NM (2007, a joint meeting with Pulsed Power). Recent PPCs were held in Chicago, IL (2011), Washington DC (2009), and Albuquerque, NM (2007, joint with ICOPS). In 2013, PPPS will be held in San Francisco, CA (http://www.ece.unm.edu/ppps2013/) on June 16-21. Projected attendance is approximately 800 participants.\r\n \r\nThe conference will include plenary, oral, and poster sessions on research in pulsed power and plasma science and technology and Prize Addresses by the recipients of the Plasma Science and Applications Committee Award, the Ervin Marx Award, and the Peter Haas Award. Oral sessions will include plenary, invited and contributed papers. Plenary papers are 50 minutes for presentation with 10 minutes for discussion; Invited papers are allotted 25 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions. Contributed papers are allotted 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for discussion. The PPPS Mini-course, organized by John Giuliani of Naval Research Laboratory, is on High Energy Density Physics.\r\n\r\nPlasma technologies are expanding rapidly into new areas including bio-medical areas, high energy density matter, materials processing, in addition to continued growth in traditional areas such as basic physics, lighting, radiation sources, beam physics, inertial and magnetic confinement fusion, environmental sciences, and pulsed power. These areas depend on a strong foundation of basic research featured in the PPPS meeting. The PPPS technical program continues to reflect the dynamic evolution of pulsed power and plasma science through plenary, invited, and oral talks, as well as interactive poster sessions in a diverse set of sessions organized by a diverse group of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for students to attend the IEEE Pulsed Power and Plasma Science conference. It will support student travel grants, particularly underrepresented minorities, promote women in engineering, and help in awards costs. The travel grant will be awarded to those students who will be presenting papers (oral talks and posters) as first authors. If a large number of students will be presenting their work, then a committee consisting of three members of the local organizing committee will choose students on the basis of merit and need.",
