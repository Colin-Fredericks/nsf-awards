 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paine College proposes to implement a project entitled \"Undertanding Barriers to STEM Education for African American Women\". The project will investigate the underlying factors linked to the disproportionate participation of African American women in STEM fields. Specifically, the PI will identify the psychological and contextual barriers that limit their preparation in STEM disciplines using a consolidated longitudinal mixed methods research design. The study will investigate the link between career decisions and self-efficacy and the impact of the learning context on African American women's persistence in STEM. The study will also identify patterns of secondary education preparation in math and science that differentiate STEM and non-STEM African American females. \r\n\r\nThe project will enhance the body of knowledge on ethnic minorities by presenting a rigorous research study beyond anecdotal data that gives a better understanding of the socialization experiences of ethnic minority students, especially African American females. The study can be replicated at other HBCUs and other institutions seeking to circumvent contextual barriers through holistic interventions designed for African American female students. It also could provide new insights into the intersectionality of gender and race.",
