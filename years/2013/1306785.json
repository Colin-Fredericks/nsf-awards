 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Pnictide superconductors, which contain arsenic, one of the pnictogen elements in the periodic table, are scientifically and technically interesting materials.  They are scientifically interesting because they also contain iron, which, until the pnictide superconductors were discovered, was thought to prevent superconductivity.  They are technically interesting because they are one of the very few superconducting materials that have properties that may make them suitable for practical applications.  The most important property for practical applications is the ability for the superconductor to carry enormous amounts of current and for this current to go across grain boundaries in polycrystalline round wires.  The pnictide superconductors have unexpectedly high current transport across grain boundaries and they can be made as round wires, which is the preferred form for practical applications.  This research investigates the factors that control current transport across grain boundaries with the goal of increasing it even further.  Wires made with these pnictide superconductors may help improve the performance and decrease the operating cost of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and they may be used in very-high field magnets that are used to unravel the structure of protein molecules.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This research investigates the role that synthesis and doping play in determining the microstructural and superconducting properties of untextured polycrystals of clean, well-connected pnictide superconductors.  The grains and grain boundaries are modified by changing the dopant ions that induce superconductivity and varying the heating schedules.  The electromagnetic properties of the polycrystalline samples are measured and the grain boundaries are investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The pnictides have the potential to transform high-field magnet technology because their untextured, round-wire form is far preferable to the highly-textured yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) coated conductors that are currently seen as the breakout technology for high-field magnets.  This research is done by a graduate student and undergraduate students.  During the summers there are K-12 teachers (NSF-RET) and summer undergraduate students from other universities (NSF-REU) who do relevant, hands-on research projects.  This work has productive collaborations with research groups in the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBa-122 (BaFe2As2) is a high temperature superconductor that is of fundamental scientific interest because it has superconductivity in an iron-containing material.  It is of potential technological interest because it has electromagnetic properties to be useful as a wire to build high-field magnets, and it may be much less expensive to produce than other high temperature superconductors.  Also, Ba-122 can be made as round wire, which is the wire geometry that magnet designers and builder prefer.  However, the current carrying capacity, Jc, of Ba-122 needs to be increased by a factor of about 5 (at 4.2 K in 10 T field) to be a useful superconductor for high-field magnet applications.  This research focused on understanding what limits Jc at grain boundaries and how to increase Jc.\n\nPure Ba-122 is not superconducting, but becomes superconducting when part of the Ba is replaced by K or when part of the Fe is replaced by Co.  We studied both variations of Ba-122, but invested most of our effort on K-doped material because it has the highest Jc in samples with randomly oriented Ba-122 grains.  We only studied polycrystalline Ba-122 samples with randomly oriented grains the Ba-122 is unaligned in round wires. In addition to just replacing part of the Ba with K, we also replaced some of the K with Na, creating double doping on the Ba atom site.  This double doping did not increases Jc.  In other samples, we replaced part of the Ba with K and part of the Fe with Co.  This double doping increased Jc very slight in some samples compared to the highest Jc K-doped samples. \n\nWe synthesize all of our Ba-122 samples in an inert atmosphere glove box that removes water and oxygen from the Ar atmosphere.  This minimizes reactions between the Ba-122 constituents and oxygen and water in the atmosphere.  We did Atomic Probe Tomography (APT) with Seidman?s group at Northwestern to investigate the composition of the samples, particularly at grain boundaries.  These studies showed that oxygen had segregated to grain boundaries, suggesting oxygen the samples picked up O2 and/or H2O while being synthesized.  Compositional traces showed that the K concentration dipped at the grain boundaries. \n\nWe knew from our own experience that as-synthesized Ba-122 could degrade in contact with air.  Because Ba-122 samples are handled in air, we were interested in what causes the degradation.  We tested our Ba-122 polycrystals and single crystals from collaborators at Ames Lab in different atmospheres. We found that water vapor was the major culprit causing the degradation, and it attacked the grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples faster than the flat surfaces of single crystals. \n\nThe APT studies showed suggested we picked up oxygen from the glove box atmosphere.  We tried to improve the atmosphere in our old glove box,  which was &gt;20 years old, but a combination of problems with the old glove box, including several components wearing out or breaking prevented us from synthesizing high-quality samples.  At the tail end of the research project we purchased a new glove box with funds from another source that reduced the oxygen and water content to extremely low levels (&lt;0.01 ppm O2 and ~0.01 ppm H2O).  We expected samples synthesized in the new glove box would have high Jc than samples made in the old, dirtier glove box, but Jc only increased by about a factor of 1.5.  We did Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy studies with a collaborator at the MagLab on samples made in the new glove box.  They showed very little oxygen at the grain boundaries, so cleaning up the atmosphere significantly decreased the oxygen content.  However, we found C at grain boundaries, which we think was introduced in one of the steps in the synthesis process.  Surprisingly there was excess K on some of the grain boundaries and at triple points, whereas K was deficient at grain boundaries in samples with oxygen at the grain boundaries. \n\nIn the course of this research, we worked with many collaborators providing targets for thin film deposition and bulk samples for a variety of other studies.  We fabricated a 10 mm diameter Ba-122 disc that was used as a trapped-field magnet that trapped &gt; 1 T at 5 K. \n\nWe have not synthesized Ba-122 samples yet with clean enough grain boundaries to answer the fundamental question of whether the current limiting mechanism is extrinsic impurities at grain boundaries or if it is an intrinsic property of misaligned grains.  We made significant progress synthesizing higher-purity samples using the new glove box, and eliminating other possible sources of impurities.  We believe the next step is to modify the synthesis conditions themselves to further improve grain boundaries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric E Hellstrom"
