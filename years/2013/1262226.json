 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThe focus of this research program, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is to explore dynamic component exchange (DCE) in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials.  While many studies suggest that some MOFs are 'inert' to certain solvents and reagents (e.g. acids), it has been discovered that such materials can undergo ligand exchange reactions (i.e. DCE) even under mild conditions.  This discovery was initially made by utilizing aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) to analyze the composition of individual MOF microcrystals.  These studies were the first use of ATOFMS in materials science (including nanomaterials) and are part of a unique collaboration between synthetic inorganic and analytical environmental chemistry at the U.C. San Diego.  This research program will study DCE in detail, to identify which MOFs readily undergo DCE and to understand the mechanism of the DCE process.  This program will also utilize DCE as a methodology for functionalization of MOFs and to determine whether DCE can involve both ligand and metal ion exchange.  Finally, this project will further develop ATOFMS methods to quantify DCE and to broaden the analytical use of this method for nanomaterials.  The preliminary findings to date demonstrate that DCE is an important phenomenon that is more common among MOFs and other nanomaterials than previously recognized.  The discoveries made in this research program will have important implications for the use of MOFs in technological applications.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nNew materials are essential for the advancement of many technological fields including medicine, renewable energy, aerospace engineering, and others.  This research program is investigating a new class of porous materials and how they can be tailored for specific applications.  These new porous materials act as high-tech 'sponges' that can 'soak up' other ions or molecules.  As such, they may find use in fuel cells, batteries, and other important applications.  As part of a broader outreach and educational mission, this proposal will support the Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP), a unique internship program, which sends STEM undergraduate students to Washington D.C. to learn about the interface of science and public policy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n(i)  Intellectual Merit\n\nThis 3-year research program investigated the phenomenon of dynamic component exchange (DCE) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  MOFs are an important class of emerging materials that are constructed from two components:  a metal component and a organic component.  MOFs show promise for use in technologies as wide ranging as drug delivery to energy storage applications.  Despite the many attractive features of MOFs for these applications, the materials can prove difficult to functionalize and tailor for these specific applications.  To overcome this limitation, this program investigated and developed DCE (also referred to as postsynthetic exchange, PSE), a method by which MOFs can be readily modified and tuned.  DCE works by carefully exchanging (i.e. the \u00e6exchange\u00c6 in DCE) either the metal or organic component of the MOF in a manner that does not disturb the underlying structure of the material.  Much like repairing a wooden fence, individual planks can be removed and replaced, without changing the primary structure of the fence &ndash; similarly DCE can remove individual components without disrupting the structure of the MOF.\n\nIn this program, DCE was developed into a mature method to functionalize MOFs.  Indeed, the work from this program and other research groups working in parallel, have proven that DCE is among the most effective methods for tuning the properties of MOFs.  The discoveries and studies in this program were significantly enhanced by utilizing aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) to analyze the composition of MOFs undergoing DCE.  ATOFMS is an advanced analytic method that was also advanced in this program in order to better understand the DCE process.  Ultimately, this research program produced more than a half dozen manuscripts in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, dozens of conference abstracts and presentations, and training for numerous graduate student and postdoctoral researchers.\n\n \n\n(ii)  Broader Impacts\n\nThis research program also continued to expand the Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP).  SPIP supports STEM undergraduates from across the University of California to perform science policy internships in Washington D.C.  These students spent their summer quarter (~10 weeks) learning and practicing the interface between science and public policy.  SPIP fellows participated in a course on science policy taught by leading policy experts on topics such as federal funding of science, how science informs public policy, and the history of science policy in the United States.  Each fellow also participated in a science policy internship at organizations including the American Association of Universities (AAU), the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Smithsonian Institute, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and in Congressional offices.  At the end of the summer, SPIP fellows produced final reports, including work products from their internship.  A total of nine students were supported during this program (three per year), including participants from U.C. San Diego, Davis, Irvine, and Berkeley.  The SPIP program gave these students a unique opportunity to participate in the science policy process that has a profound impact on the direction of research in the United States.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth M Cohen"
