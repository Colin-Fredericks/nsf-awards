 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: Climate models suggest that variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is linked to sea surface temperature changes on inter-annual to multi-decadal time scales that can have far reaching societal impacts. Additionally, climate models continue to project a substantial weakening of the AMOC over the next century that could feed back on the climate system through reduced carbon dioxide uptake in the North Atlantic (2007 Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The specific role of the AMOC in the climate system has been difficult to determine due to a lack of long term measurements of its variability. However, the joint US-UK ocean observing system along 26.5\u00b0N (RAPID-MOCHA) has now provided continuous estimates of the AMOC for nearly a decade that have revealed the nature of its seasonal to inter-annual variability, the only such full-depth, basin-wide measurements currently available. The RAPID-MOCHA program has already provided a critical benchmark for evaluation of forced, data-assimilative, and coupled climate models, and is forming a fundamental building block around which international programs are being developed to monitor the AMOC throughout the Atlantic basin.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The goal of this project is to maintain this measurement system for an additional 6 years, from 2014 to 2020, to quantify the inter-annual variability of the AMOC and its relationship to changes in surface forcing over the North Atlantic. The ocean meridional heat transport (MHT) at 26.5\u00b0N will also be monitored, including the time varying contributions by the overturning and gyre components of the heat transport. The last few years of the time series have shown significant inter-annual time-scale changes with respect to prior years, which are believed to be linked to changes in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing. Ocean heat content and Sea Surface Temperature changes in the mid-latitude North Atlantic also appear to be linked to the recent AMOC changes. The results of the RAPID-MOCHA project thus far have been primarily focused on an accurate determination of the mean AMOC strength and vertical structure, its associated heat transport, and the dynamics of the seasonal cycle and shorter-term variations. The focus going forward will be to document and understand the causes of inter-annual variability and to link AMOC changes observed at 26.5\u00b0N to other AMOC indices and results from developing AMOC measurement programs around the Atlantic basin.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project are to provide the basis for long-term monitoring of the AMOC, so that its relationship to observed climate fluctuations can be understood, and our ability to assess climate model predictions can be improved. This project will continue a successful international collaboration with investigators from the U.K. National Oceanography Centre as part of the U.K. RAPID-WATCH program. The U.S. contribution to this in-situ ocean  observation system includes: (1) Florida Current monitoring using the operational submarine cable, calibrated by regular cruises with expendable temperature dropsondes, shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and hydrographic/lowered-ADCP measurements, and (2) continuous moored time series measurements across the Deep Western Boundary Current and Antilles Current region east of the Bahamas, including hydrographic/lowered-ADCP sections at nine-month intervals in concert with scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA. The Florida Current monitoring is independently supported by NOAA. The U.K. will provide support for the extended array of moorings along 26.5\u00b0N that completes the trans-basin continuous time series observing system.\r\n\r\nThis project is a contribution to the US AMOC under the US CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program to maintain the moored component of element for a six-year period extending from March 2014 to March 2020.",

The updated time series suggests that the AMOC has not reduced further during 2012-2018 but has maintained a weaker circulation state relative to the first years of observations, with indications of possible rebound now beginning (Moat et al., 2020). The reduced AMOC state after 2009 was found to be concurrent with other changes in the North Atlantic such as a broadening of the Gulf Stream, evidenced by a change in the currents observed by satellite altimetry, and by altered patterns of ocean heat content and sea-surface temperature that resemble the pattern of response to a declining AMOC predicted by coupled climate models (Smeed et al., 2018).&nbsp; Recent freshening and cooling of the subpolar North Atlantic has been linked to the reduced AMOC state at 26.5N (Bryden et al., 2020).</p>\n<p>The meridional ocean heat transport (MHT) at 26.5 N continues to show a high correlation with the AMOC strength (r=0.94), and showed a decrease from 1.33 PW for 2004-2008 to 1.17 PW for 2011-2018. (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/mocha/). Most of the reduction in the AMOC (and MHT) can be attributed to changes in the geostrophic (non-Ekman) circulation, linked primarily to an increase in the southward upper ocean transport across the ocean interior. Observations of ocean heat content (OHC) from Argo data show that the North Atlantic OHC reached a decadal peak in about 2007 and has since declined, consistent with the lower recent AMOC and MHT values recorded by the 26.5 N array.</p>\n<p class=\"StyleBodyTextJustified\">Detailed observations of the western boundary circulation at 26.5 N obtained as part of RAPID-MOCHA have been used to study the strength and variability of key current systems and their relationship to the AMOC, including the Antilles Current and Deep Western Boundary Current (Meinen et al., 2019; Bilo and Johns, 2019; Bilo and Johns, 2020). Among other results, the long-term mean DWBC transport is shown to be approximaely 30 Sv, which is about 12 Sv larger than the time-mean southward flow of NADW across 26.5 N derived from the basinwide AMOC array (Bilo and Johns, 2020). The primary cause of this is a localized recirculation cell near the western boundary - referred to as the \"Abaco gyre\" - that is one of several deep cyclonic recirculation cells adjacent to the western boundary between 15-30 N that act to locally enhance the DWBC transport. In addition to revealing the presence of these deep recirculation cells, a basinwide analysis of hydrographic and deep Argo drift data indicates that the DWBC at 26.5 N is fed by two primary pathways, one along the western boundary and one along a zonal interior pathway that feeds into the western boundary near 30?N. The latter is comprised mostly of Labrador Sea Water that follows a large-scale anticyclonic interior pathway from the Grand Banks to the subtropics, including branches on both sides of the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Bilo and Johns, 2019). The results show that at 26.5 N the DWBC carries the entirety of the lower limb AMOC transport, but that its transport is locally enhanced by the aforementioned deep recirculation cells.</p>\n<p>Data and results are available online:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOC data: &nbsp;http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/rapidmoc/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heat transport data: &nbsp;https://mocha.rsmas.miami.edu/mocha/index.html</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;E&nbsp;Johns</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1332978/1332978_10255729_1610143611294_NSFfinalreportFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1332978/1332978_10255729_1610143611294_NSFfinalreportFig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AMOC time series at 26.5N\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1332978/1332978_10255729_1610143611294_NSFfinalreportFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AMOC time series at 26.5N\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
