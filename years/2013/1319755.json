 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will soon enter the manycore era, in which systems will include\r\nhundreds of cores, large multi-level cache structures, sophisticated\r\nnetworks-on-chip, many memory controllers, and huge amounts of main\r\nmemory.  These systems will also embody a rich array of power\r\nmanagement mechanisms and will strive to achieve high performance\r\nunder various power, energy, and thermal constraints.  Unfortunately,\r\nthe uncoordinated power management of a system's components can\r\nproduce oscillating behavior, higher power/energy/temperature, and/or\r\nexcessive performance degradation.  Given their large number of\r\nhardware components and the wide spectrum of available mechanisms,\r\nmanycore systems will have to coordinate the actions of their various\r\npower managers.  Moreover, to decide on a (coordinated) course of\r\naction, these systems will have to comprehensively and rigorously\r\nreason about various performance and power/energy/temperature\r\ntradeoffs.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop global power coordination (GPC) to manage the\r\ncombinatorial explosion of possible power management configurations in\r\nmanycore systems.  GPC will be realized using an engine that analyzes\r\nthe space of possible power state configurations for the entire\r\nsystem. It will then decide which configurations are most appropriate,\r\nand use per-component power managers to actuate the proper settings.\r\nTo optimize the search for good configurations, GPC will consider\r\ngreedy search heuristics that prune the space by relying on novel\r\ntechniques that estimate the benefit of power state changes, group\r\nresources with similar power management hooks, and leverage prior\r\nobserved behavior and a hierarchical organization.\r\n\r\nThis project will broadly impact society in many ways.  First,\r\naddressing the power, energy, and temperature problems of manycore\r\nsystems can greatly impact the datacenters that run our Internet\r\nservices and the high-performance systems that advance our science.\r\nSecond, tackling these problems will address one of the key\r\ntechnological barriers in the computing industry.  Third, the project\r\nwill educate graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, while\r\nbroadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computer\r\nscience.",
