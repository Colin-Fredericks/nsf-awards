 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of South Florida entitled, \"RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site: RET in Functional Materials at the University of South Florida\", under the direction of Venkat R. Bhethanabotla and Dr. Sylvia W. Thomas. The University of South Florida (USF) College of Engineering (COE), in partnership with the school districts of Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties and St. Petersburg College will conduct an eight week summer RET in Functional Materials for 15 teachers per year for 3 years (45 total); 9 local high school teachers, 2 local community college instructors and 4 pre-service teachers. Materials Science is chosen as the focus because of its highly interdisciplinary nature (making it relevant to a large number of subject areas). The pervasive presence of materials in everyday life can provide multiple teaching contexts, and its research emphasis at the University of South Florida is the perfect conduit. USF has made substantial investments in the past 10 years in materials science through the hiring of 20+ materials research faculty, establishment of a shared metrology and clean room facility, an interdisciplinary master's program in materials science and engineering and large scale research computing facilities. The project team further proposes to sustain this collaborative atmosphere among participants through the creation of an educational resource, the Materials College, to be designed and implemented by the participants themselves.  This web-based resource will house the participants' inquiry-based lesson plans within a coherent structure, containing additional content that provides an overview of Materials Science and its relevance to current technologies, describes the fundamental knowledge required by practitioners in the field and highlights applications to the field of core subjects taught in high schools and community colleges. \r\n\r\nThe Materials College activity will provide a framework for the sustained engagement of, and collaboration among, teachers and provide a foundation for building additional partnerships with other school districts, community colleges and Colleges of Education. Web-based dissemination of lesson plans in a focused structure will enhance the professional development of a\r\nbroad range of teachers. The diversity of participants will result in expanded participation of underrepresented groups and women in STEM disciplines. The project team expects that its efforts will result in an increased number of math and science certified teachers and U.S./permanent resident AA and BS degree holders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBetween 2014 and 2019, thirty high school science and math teachers, pre-service STEM teachers, and community college faculty participated in an RET guided by faculty members of the Functional Materials and Manufacturing Institute (FMMI) at the University of South Florida (USF).  The major goal of the program was to provide a quality professional development experience to STEM teachers who would translate their knowledge and experience into motivating lessons for their students.\n\nThe RET included an immersive eight-week summer experience in which participants performed authentic research in the field of functional materials, guided by a faculty mentor and his/her associated graduate students.  Participants summarized their research contributions in a poster, which they presented at an annual RET/REU Research Symposium.  Participants also developed a lesson plan for use in their classrooms, and took a course in the fundamentals of materials science and engineering.  Lesson plans and posters created by the participants are available on our program website:  http://fmri-materials-college.eng.usf.edu/\n\nParticipants:\n\nTwenty-five of the participants were high school STEM teachers, while three were community college faculty and two were preservice teachers.  Over 70% of the participants taught bioscience or chemistry classes at their schools with the remainder almost evenly divided between teaching math, physics or engineering courses.\n\nThe gender and race characteristics of the participants are shown in Figure 1.  The minority category includes Hispanic (23%), African American (10%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (7 %).\n\nResearch Component:\n\nAll participants had results to show when they presented their posters.  At least five of them are co-authors of refereed journal articles or conference presentations and more are expected.  However, the research experience was somewhat stressful for many participants at the beginning ? because they were not used to the open-ended nature of research. It is interesting to note though that, by programs end, many participants found this frustrating experience to be very valuable ? and planned to incorporate more authentic exercises into their classrooms.  To quote some of the participants:\n\nIn school classrooms we always do experiments where we know the expected outcome. In research, an outcome is usually not expected and is in some cases surprising. I want to focus on doing more open ended experiences where students can conduct experiments where outcomes are not expected.\n\nI think being exposed to university level research will boost the research experiences I provide for my students.  I will also incorporate the idea that sometimes research doesn't work and multiple trials are needed to get accurate results.  I think that idea has been missing from my classroom.\n\nLesson Plan Component:\n\nSubsequent academic year surveys indicated that only a few of the participants were able to implement their lesson plans, invariably because, in a high-stakes testing environment, they could not spare the time.  However, most found other ways to translate their RET experience to their students.  For example, one participant was unable to implement her lesson plan in her biology course but she re-tooled her laboratory exercises to include less rote memorization in favor of inquiry-based activities and lessons.  Others were able to carve out one or two activities from their lesson plans and implement them as standalone exercises.\n\nOne participant, a physics teacher, was inspired by the RET program to develop a pre-engineering course at his high school. \n\nAnother created an interdisciplinary project involving physics, chemistry, and biology students.  The group developed an inexpensive colorimeter to test phosphate levels in a nearby river.  Students worked on their own time and came in after school for sample testing. \n\nOther post-program activities include visits to participants? classrooms by their faculty mentors and laboratory tours given to the students of the program participants.  One of the participants, working with the project PI, implemented a Research Experiences for High School Students (REHSS) program, as an add-on to our 2016 RET program. \n\nAs a result of the activities described above, several hundred high school/community college students have been impacted by the RET program in functional materials. \n\nPost-Program Survey Results:\n\nThe aggregated results of post-program surveys of the participants shown in Figure 2 indicate strong satisfaction with the program.\n\nNumerical response items included (1 = low to 10 = high):\n\nI1         Comfort in introducing an engineering topic in your classroom   \n\nI2         Satisfaction with the program orientation      \n\nI3         Satisfaction with the teacher-faculty interaction \n\nI4         Satisfaction with the classroom component (first time participants only)              \n\nI5         Satisfaction with the teacher-teacher interaction \n\nI6         Satisfaction with the lesson plan component         \n\nI7         Satisfaction with the research component\n\nParticipants were asked to comment on various aspects of the program.  They overwhelmingly indicated that the chance to do authentic research was the most valuable aspect of the program and unanimously indicated they would participate in such a program again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Venkat R Bhethanabotla"
