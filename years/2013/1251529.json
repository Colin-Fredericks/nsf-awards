 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the Earth's climate warms over the next century, ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere will be exposed to elevated rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition.  Understanding this complex environmental change lies at the heart of our ability to anticipate the degree to which forests will sequester human-produced carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in a sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystem common over eastern North America.  During the past 18 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem.  However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will attain a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases or whether expected warming will counteract this effect.  The proposed research will quantify the amounts of carbon stored in overstory trees, forest floor and soil over the next decade, allowing this team of scientists to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration.\r\n\r\nUsing NSF support, this team will continue conducting the annual Global Change Teachers Institute.  Through lectures and field-based learning, middle and high school teachers will continue to develop an understanding of the causes and ecological impacts of global environmental change, thereby bringing this information into science curricula.",

These nitrogen-emitting human activities are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere where the added nitrogen can cause an increase in forest growth rate, helping forests remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&nbsp; &nbsp;However it is not known if the growth enhancement caused by elevated nitrogen&nbsp;deposition will be sustained and if increased growth might eventually lead to increased mortality, as faster growing trees compete for resources.&nbsp; To address these questions, ecologists at Michigan Technological University, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Michigan and the University of Idaho, conducted a long-term nitrogen addition experiment in sugar maple dominated forests in Michigan.&nbsp; From 1994 to 2017, forests at four research locations annually received experimental nitrogen additions at a rate of 3 grams of nitrogen per square meter.&nbsp; This is 2.5 to 4 times the natural rate of atmospheric nitrogen input and represents a rate of nitrogen deposition that may occur in some locations in the future.&nbsp; Specific objectives of the research at these study sites, were to:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; determine if a previously documented growth enhancement would continue; 2) determine if forests in warmer, more southern locations would respond to a greater degree than those in cooler, more northern locations; 3) determine if faster growth would lead to increased mortality and greater creation of coarse woody debris (dead trees and logs); and 4) determine if coarse woody debris would decay more slowly in the nitrogen addition treatment, leading to more carbon storage in this material.</p>\n<p><br /> Key findings during the five year study period included:&nbsp; 1) a continuation of growth enhancement (12% increase), with only a slight declines over time in the positive growth response to elevated nitrogen additions; 2) greater responses to nitrogen additions at the northernmost sites; 3) a tree mortality rate for the nitrogen deposition treatment that is slightly greater, but is proportional to the growth enhancement; 4) reduced fungal decomposition in the nitrogen addition treatment of dead trees and logs and soil organic matter derived from dead roots.&nbsp; These results indicate that the treated forests, which received elevated nitrogen additions for 24 years, continued to capture and store more carbon as a result of the extra nitrogen availability.&nbsp; The accumulated carbon was stored in living tree biomass (due to enhanced growth); dead trees and logs (due to proportionally greater mortality and reduced decomposition of dead wood); and the forest floor and soil (due to slower decomposition of dead roots).&nbsp;&nbsp;These results indicate that elevated atmospheric&nbsp;nitrogen deposition has the potential to cause the forests to produce more wood, become stronger carbon sinks, and help offset a portion of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.&nbsp; However, very warm temperatures and soil moisture depletion both caused reduced sugar maple growth, which could counter the growth enhancement from human-caused nitrogen deposition under predicted future climates.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these findings, greater export of dissolved carbon and nitrogen in soil solution occurred where nitrogen was added, which could affect groundwater and streams.&nbsp; Finally, nitrogen additions caused reduced seedling survival for sugar maple but not for all other species present, suggesting elevated nitrogen deposition may&nbsp;change the composition of future forests by altering the relative abilities of the species present to successfully reproduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the project, numerous young students interested in ecological research were trained.&nbsp; At Michigan Tech, fourteen undergraduate students participated, including five who completed independent research projects using funds from NSF?s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.&nbsp; &nbsp;A master of science student, a doctoral student and a high school research intern also were trained.&nbsp; Data from the project is available to the scientific community and the general public through the project?s web site, and archived soil and plant samples were willingly shared with interested scientists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To reach a broader public audience, the project hosted a Global Change Teacher Institute during three of the five years.&nbsp;
