 "awd_abstract_narration": "The implementation project at Jackson State University entitled - Institutional Change through Faculty Advancement in Instruction and Mentoring - builds on two successful previous implementation projects and aims to increase the retention of undergraduate students in the College of Science, Engineering and Technology by helping the faculty and graduate students to improve teaching and mentoring. The project focuses its initial efforts on the Department of Physics, Atmospheric Sciences and Geoscience (PASGS) by piloting faculty development workshops in student-centered pedagogy and delivering professional mentoring. The project also supports the department's efforts to revise the content of entry-level physics courses and their respective labs. \r\n\r\nTo examine the efficacy of faculty development in mentoring and the development of a research methods course, the project supports students and faculty to increase the number of research opportunities on campus during the academic year and with partner institutions year round. This will increase overall undergraduate research participation. The project will expand from one primarily targeting PASGS to one that is institutionalized within the departments in the college. It offers an opportunity to collect data that will guide the faculty on how to successfully address the particular learning and mentoring needs of African American science,technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project has the potential to become a successful model which will be shared with the broader community of colleges and universities that are working to increase the number of minorities entering the scientific and technological workforce.",

Mean (M) levels increased slightly most years, but remained steady overall.

Such an approach may ensure the greatest success of knowledge transference - from instructors to students.\"\n\nA multi-year participant reflected on how instructors decide the best approach for integrating new pedagogical practices: \"It is up to the faculty to implement the suitable approach provided limitations (time, incentive and other) are minimized.\" Several faculty members reiterated that many STEM educators were trained as researchers, are considered \"experts\" in their respective fields, but have not been trained as instructors: \n\n\"Most faculty in STEM disciplines were trained well as researchers but received little to no instruction in teaching strategies and how students learn. The current methods used by most faculty is outdated and don't engage the current students.\"\n\nParticipants agreed that, if instructors participate in this type of PD, their students will exhibit: 1) greater motivation to learn; 2) greater interest in concepts, rendering classes more enjoyable; 3) improved critical thinking skills; and 4) better technology use to support students' studies. \n\n \n\nSuggested Improvements to ICFAIM\n\nThe majority of participants (78%) wanted more PD sessions and year-round PD support and training. Suggested program improvements included: 1) more self-directed learning, with participants organizing the scope of PD instruction; 2) more strategies for increasing student motivation in STEM; 3) more strategies for increasing retention of science majors; 4) guidance on how to integrate technology in the classroom; and 5) gauging faculty members'commitment to change and integrating what is learned on a regular basis as criterion for program participation.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings show that a long-term commitment to faculty PD can change faculty views about STEM teaching, even among those who at first resist altering long-employed approaches to gatekeeper STEM course content material and laboratory experiments. Our findings suggest that, if it is to achieve its goals, STEM faculty PD must be: 1) carefully designed to build on shared standards and knowledge; 2) provided incrementally over time; 3) focused on topics of concern to faculty in addition to presenting new ones; and 4) fairly incentivized. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mehri Fadavi"
