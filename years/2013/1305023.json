 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description: \r\nThis effort involves the creation and implementation of an I-Corps Regional Node in New York (New York City Regional Innovation Node - NYCRIN), which is being led by City University of New York (CUNY) in partnership with New York University (NYU) and Columbia University. The Node is leveraging the existing innovation ecosystem present in New York City (NYC) to create a cooperative center that is connected to the national I-Corps innovation network. NYCRIN is building upon established technology development collaborations that are involved with the fundamental research being conducted at the three partnering institutions. NYCRIN is providing innovators throughout the United States with a structured portal for access to the unique NYC-regional combination of world-class universities, venture capital investment resources, and one of the nation's fastest growing technology start-up environments. \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Significance: \r\nNYCRIN is promoting diversity and outreach activities to Small Business Development Centers throughout New York State. The Node is offering scalable workshops, seminars and counseling sessions to disseminate best practices and the \"Lean\" methods to non-academic audiences, technology entrepreneurs, and community partners. It is further leveraging and supporting a number of unique training activities, for example: 1) a week-long \"sprint\" for developing and iterating technical product ideas in small collaborative teams and 2) events that draw hundreds of students to NYC to build new products collaboratively over a limited time period. The Node also includes a wide range of other universities (public, private, and small private technology colleges) in a four state region; providing them with open-source tools and online access to information - to more broadly disseminate NYCRIN activities and outputs. The Node is further networking with local community colleges that have linkages to workforce development efforts and small businesses.",

NYCRIN has thoroughly embraced the NSF vision of what a regional node can accomplish and is a model for I-Corps Nodes nationally.

The NYCRIN teaching team has significantly influenced the growth and development of the I-Corps program, as well as the creation of the NIN, with its leadership playing a major role in creating and refining the curriculum. NYCRIN has 13 nationally trained instructors; since 2013 it has delivered six national I-Corps cohorts in NYC including over 45 adjuncts and over 45 observers. NYCRIN instructors have served as national core instructors, adjuncts, and observers at all of the other nodes and interacted with and taught nearly half of the total of national I-Corps teams through 2017. NYCRIN instructors have also served as core faculty for national train the trainer sessions at four separate locations.

The largest representation is from the start-up and investment community, affirming its value for NYCRIN I-Corps teams.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Establishment of NSF I-Corps sites in the NYCRIN region</span></em>.&nbsp; NYCRIN has fully embraced its role of partnering with regional schools and creating I-Corps Teams and Sites. NYCRIN has been instrumental in creating and developing most of the I-Corps Sites in its region. NYCRIN aggressively recruited I-Corps teams from its regional schools, several of which have gone on to become I-Corps Sites. NYCRIN has had a tremendous impact on the growth of these Sites: between 2013-2016, NYCRIN Sites formed more than 109 national I-Corps teams - many, if not the majority, of these were recruited and organized in partnership with NYCRIN. The impact on the culture of regional institutions is clear, and positive - numerous new programs now wish to be considered as I-Corps Sites. We will work with these schools to assist them in their development as we have already assisted the existing Site schools.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NYCRIN SBIR Phase 0 Teams were drawn from across the country</span></em>.&nbsp; NYCRIN is proud to say that the Phase 0 program was overall a success. NYCRIN nominated 12 teams to the Spring 2018 cohorts. All were accepted but 1 team backed out due to changes in their schedule. Additionally, 2 NYCRIN teams completed the Mentor cohort in Indianapolis in Spring 2018.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NYCRIN Regional I-Corps</span></em>.&nbsp; Between Spring 2014 and Fall 2017, NYCRIN led 5 full, canonical regional I-Corps cohorts. Approximately half of the teams in these cohorts were existing companies, several of which have SBIR funding. As these are a regional activity, teams / companies may apply from any state in the NYCRIN region. The greatest impact beyond the teams/companies has been with our regional Sites leaders, who comprise the 88 adjuncts and observers of these cohorts. They joined the cohort so they could learn how to deliver their own I-Corps courses. As is NYCRIN's policy, all course materials were provided to these instructors for use at their own institutions.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lessons Learned</span></em>:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Development of I-Corps information packets and Team Executive Summary templates facilitated the recruitment of regional/national I-Corps teams</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Development of the final, curated, annotated I-Corps slide deck so that NYCRIN instructors deliver consistent content</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The NYCRIN region contains numerous ecosystem experts qualified and willing to participate in Level 1 activities</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Adjuncts are willing to travel to NYC to participate</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Pre-kickoff adjunct meetings, accompanied by debriefs after each session, to ensure consistent philosophy and messaging are important</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Development of the NSF I-Corps Observer Guide enabled network school admin and future Site teaching faculty to rapidly learn the I-Corps process</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Consequently, NYCRIN worked with, trained, and supported most of the awarded I-Corps Sites around its region</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; Utilization of network school space for NYCRIN regional I-Corps cohort venues worked very well and the teams were quite satisfied</p>\n<p>- Outreach Best Practices for increasing Diversity of Teams paticipating in I-Corps programs</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Blaho</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305023/1305023_10233265_1559226387097_newNYCRINforwebex--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305023/1305023_10233265_1559226387097_newNYCRINforwebex--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Original NYCRIN Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305023/1305023_10233265_1559226387097_newNYCRINforwebex--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Original NYCRIN Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Original Partners of NYCRIN from NY, NJ, CT, and PA.

NYCRIN has fully embraced its role of partnering with regional schools and creating I-Corps Teams and Sites. NYCRIN has been instrumental in creating and developing most of the I-Corps Sites in its region. NYCRIN aggressively recruited I-Corps teams from its regional schools, several of which have gone on to become I-Corps Sites. NYCRIN has had a tremendous impact on the growth of these Sites: between 2013-2016, NYCRIN Sites formed more than 109 national I-Corps teams - many, if not the majority, of these were recruited and organized in partnership with NYCRIN. The impact on the culture of regional institutions is clear, and positive - numerous new programs now wish to be considered as I-Corps Sites. We will work with these schools to assist them in their development as we have already assisted the existing Site schools.\n\nNYCRIN SBIR Phase 0 Teams were drawn from across the country.  NYCRIN is proud to say that the Phase 0 program was overall a success. NYCRIN nominated 12 teams to the Spring 2018 cohorts. All were accepted but 1 team backed out due to changes in their schedule. Additionally, 2 NYCRIN teams completed the Mentor cohort in Indianapolis in Spring 2018.\n\nNYCRIN Regional I-Corps.  Between Spring 2014 and Fall 2017, NYCRIN led 5 full, canonical regional I-Corps cohorts. Approximately half of the teams in these cohorts were existing companies, several of which have SBIR funding. As these are a regional activity, teams / companies may apply from any state in the NYCRIN region. The greatest impact beyond the teams/companies has been with our regional Sites leaders, who comprise the 88 adjuncts and observers of these cohorts. They joined the cohort so they could learn how to deliver their own I-Corps courses. As is NYCRIN's policy, all course materials were provided to these instructors for use at their own institutions.\n\nLessons Learned:\n\n-  Development of I-Corps information packets and Team Executive Summary templates facilitated the recruitment of regional/national I-Corps teams\n\n-  Development of the final, curated, annotated I-Corps slide deck so that NYCRIN instructors deliver consistent content\n\n-  The NYCRIN region contains numerous ecosystem experts qualified and willing to participate in Level 1 activities\n\n-  Adjuncts are willing to travel to NYC to participate\n\n-  Pre-kickoff adjunct meetings, accompanied by debriefs after each session, to ensure consistent philosophy and messaging are important\n\n-  Development of the NSF I-Corps Observer Guide enabled network school admin and future Site teaching faculty to rapidly learn the I-Corps process\n\n-  Consequently, NYCRIN worked with, trained, and supported most of the awarded I-Corps Sites around its region\n\n-  Utilization of network school space for NYCRIN regional I-Corps cohort venues worked very well and the teams were quite satisfied\n\n- Outreach Best Practices for increasing Diversity of Teams paticipating in I-Corps programs\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Blaho"
