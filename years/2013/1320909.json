 "awd_abstract_narration": "Augmented reality (AR) systems, which are computer systems that enhance the viewing of physical objects in the world with computer data, are currently held back from widespread use for many real-world applications because of the unsolved human-computer interaction problem of how to accurately convey to a person how far away from that person a computer-generated object is intended to appear.  People using AR systems routinely misjudge the depth of AR-presented objects.   This is especially true for AR objects that should appear to be located behind opaque occluding surfaces; in this case AR should produce an \"x-ray vision\" perceptual experience that makes the occluding surface appear to become transparent.  The perceptual phenomena that underlie this problem relate to (a) conflicting depth cues that naturally arise with AR technology, especially incorrect occlusion cues in optical \"x-ray vision\" AR, (b) conflicting findings from techniques that have been developed to measure depth perception within reaching distance, and (c) the role of practice and feedback in training to correct these depth misjudgments.\r\n\r\nThis project will evaluate AR depth representation methods and explain the underlying phenomena, with an emphasis on medical AR tasks and applications.  The project will develop and evaluate a head-worn haploscope to allow researchers to study the depth cues of accommodation and vergence AR.  The project will create and evaluate vergence-based methods for rendering AR information in depth; that is, techniques in which people can control the appearance of computer data inside of a physical object by rotating their eyes as is needed to look at near and far objects.  The researchers on this project will collaborate with experts on the use of AR for medical applications to develop new vergence-based techniques for AR \"x-ray vision\"  in the medical domain.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Vergence-based AR applications have the potential to improve health outcomes for a broad array of medical procedures, and also to improve human capabilities in task domains such as manufacturing and equipment maintenance.  This project will hasten the timeframe for successfully developing and deploying such applications.  Students working on this project will be trained in an interdisciplinary context that rigorously studies the intimate interplay between computer graphics and human perception.  The interdisciplinary and human-centered aspects of the project will help to recruit students who might otherwise be less likely to gravitate to computer science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied augmented reality (AR), a computer display technique that places virtual, computer-generated objects into real world settings.  For example, modern smartphones allow virtual furniture to be placed in a house, and answer questions such as \"will this table fit in this part of my kitchen?\"  This project addressed similar questions that arise from medical AR applications, where the virtual objects come from medical scans and medical equipment, and the goal is for doctors to see the virtual objects within a patient's body.  If this succeeds, the doctor has a kind of x-ray vision, and the human body appears to be transparent.\n\nThe project involved designing and building AR displays, which allowed questions to be asked about how the human visual system reacts to seeing virtual AR objects.  The project also used commercially-available AR displays. A series of experiments was conducted, which measured some of the ways that the human visual system sees AR objects. With x-ray vision, a long-standing problem is how to represent virtual objects so that they appear to be located at the right depth within a human body (or other solid object).  The experiments determined that the angle of an observer's eyes exhibits a constant error under certain common visual conditions, but that this error can be successfully eliminated.  \n\nWhen human observers see a real, solid object, such as a coffee cup, the object appears to have a definite spatial location.  Perhaps it is sitting on a desk.  For AR, another long-standing problem is how to draw a virtual AR object that has a similarly definite spatial location.  Perhaps we wish to put a virtual AR coffee cup next to the real coffee cup, and we want the location of both cups to appear equally solid and real.  For medical AR applications, we want to place virtual medical data and virtual medical instruments in locations that also appear solid and real.  This project developed and experimentally validated new methods for calibrating AR displays, which led to increased accuracy in the perceived location of AR objects. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project was to develop additional knowledge about how the human visual system perceives the location of virtual AR objects, especially within the reaching distances used for most medical procedures.  This kind of knowledge was developed, and was applied to validated methods for placing virtual AR objects in depth and at specific locations. \n\nA broader impact was for AR medical applications to have improved depth and location accuracy.  During the time period of this project, commercial AR technology advanced significantly.  Out of many AR displays, the Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap One have had the largest impact.  These devices, and the instructions given to AR application developers, suggest that findings from this project, as well as related projects within the community of applied perceptual AR research, have positively influenced the design of this generation of AR devices.  It is likely that these devices display more accurately-perceived virtual AR objects than what would otherwise have been the case. \n\nAnother important broader impact has been the education of the students who were supported by this project. Nine graduate students were supported, all of whom studied computer science.  Four have pursued PhD degrees (one has graduated), and six MS degrees (five have graduated).  The graduated students are working at Google, Radiance Technologies, Green Mountain Technology, and Torch Technology.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
