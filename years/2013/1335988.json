To foster the continued expansion\r\nof research at TAMIU and to better provide educational/research opportunities for their students,\r\nthis proposal requests funding for equipment that will: 1) contribute to the limited understanding\r\nof the mechanism by which cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) translocate cell membranes; 2)\r\nincrease knowledge of which key spider silk peptides are associated with specific mechanical\r\nproperties; 3) elucidate the mechanisms of carbohydrates receptors responsible for malignant\r\nbehavior of cancerous cells 4) provide training and access a research methodology to a large\r\nnumber of predominantly Hispanic students, who are historically underrepresented in math and\r\nscience professions; 5) augment the education experience of several existing biology courses\r\nand enable the creation of an additional elective chemistry course on polymers; 6) foster\r\nintramural and extramural collaborations, and 7) increase TAMIU?s competitiveness for extramural\r\nresearch funding and publications.",
