The STORM system will immediately\r\nenable 28 research topics or areas proposed by 21 faculty members, most of whom are leaders of their\r\nown groups/labs, in 8 departments including Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Physics,\r\nBiology, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Physiology/Pharmacology/Neuroscience, and Microbiology/\r\nImmunology. The research activities enabled by N-STORM and performed in this project will\r\nenhance the spatiotemporal resolution of STORM, clarify a number of biomedical hypotheses and\r\nphenomena established by other means, and result in insightful novel biomedical knowledge. They will\r\npromote teaching, training, and learning and improve basic science research, disease diagnostic\r\nassessment, and therapeutics development. The results will be broadly disseminated and applied in the\r\nfields of nanoscopy, cell biology, neurobiology, and medicine to enhance scientific, technological and\r\nclinical understanding.",
