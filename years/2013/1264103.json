They will address the mitigation of membrane biofouling, due to rejected chemicals and microbes, by impregnating the solutions with nanoparticles. With the rapid growth and development of populations around the world, and the inherent need for clean water, it is imperative to treat brackish- and sea-water sources. The two leading desalination technologies are thermal and membrane technologies, specifically reverse osmosis (RO).  Nanofiltration (NF) is used for the removal of other substances from water source, and also commonly used for the desalination of water. While both RO and NF can produce potable water, RO removes a large majority of solutes, which leaves the permeate water void of essential nutrients (e.g. calcium, magnesium ions) and placing the nutrient levels below that of the required World Health Organization standards. Thus nutrients must be added (i.e. reminerailization) to bring the water back to the standard levels for drinking water.  NF methods, on the other hand, remove fewer solutes, and may avoid the need to remineralize the water. Thus, it is a more desirable technology for developing nations.  This collaborative research will address this process and will elucidate the mitigation of biofouling, through comprehensive experimental analyses and testing. Most of the research and development in the area of biofouling prevention has focused on pretreatment of the feed water, improved cleaning solutions and cleaning procedures.  The international team will develop biofouling-resistant (BRN) nanocomposite membranes, loaded with copper or silver nanoparticles, from synthesis to macro scale production.  Dr Abu-Dalo and Dr. El-Zanati will characterize the water conditions, Dr. Craver and Dr. Escobar will develop and characterize the proposed membranes, Dr. Harris will fabricate them, and Dr. Dalo and Dr. El-Zanati will test the membranes, and conduct the analysis, in harsh brackish water environments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Biofouling is an important problem in water treatment when using membranes. The PIs plan to develop novel bio-fouling resistant membranes (BRM) loaded with copper and silver ions, and to study the mechanisms of bio-fouling as well as those that cause defects in polymer composite membranes.  They will test harsh seawaters and study the membrane performance. The US and international PIs have complementary experiences in membrane development or testing, and water quality testing and analysis.  There is a mechanism to move from the lab to larger scale testing but there are a few important questions that need to be resolved first before heading to scale-up. The PIs will develop initial results and collaborative interactions to enable them to submit a full proposal.  This represents a \"high risk-high reward\" project. \r\n   \r\nBroader impacts:  This activity is to develop copper and silver doped membranes to test on variety of seawaters in Egypt and Jordan.  The results from this work could have global impact and relevance. The proposed BRM will aid in wastewater clean-up in the US, as well as being used to treat brackish water and seawater, globally. The project will fund 3 graduate students from the U.S. to spend up to 2 months in Egypt and Jordan conducting research. The activity can create opportunities for international collaborations in several areas such as research on membrane technologies, desalination and water/wastewater treatment. The research has potential for far outreach and to develop new information in bio-fouling mechanisms and membrane defect mechanisms. It is likely that this project will lead to the preparation and submission of full joint research proposals to NSF, journal publications, and development of preliminary data for a patentable membrane that could have significant long-term impact on water supply and the membrane industry. The scientists, all women, developed this proposal at a NSF sponsored meeting that was intended to foster collaboration amongst women faculty in the sciences and engineering.",
