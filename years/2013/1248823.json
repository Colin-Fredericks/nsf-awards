 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will resolve key technical challenges associated with the commercialization of an innovative die-less sheet metal forming process, Double Sided Incremental Forming (DSIF). DSIF locally deforms a peripherally clamped sheet metal component using a small hemispherical ended tool on either side of the sheet, each moving along a pre-determined tool path. Current toolpath generation methodologies do not take into account the mechanics of sheet deformation during the forming process, resulting in unacceptably high forming time and unsatisfactory geometry accuracy. This research will create new automated toolpath design methodologies which account for the deformation mechanics of the sheet metal during DSIF to achieve part accuracies of 500 \u00ecm or less while maintaining a user defined throughput. Additionally, a new DSIF forming center will be designed that can form large components using high strength alloys, where high machine stiffness and forming force are required. This work will provide a significant scientific and technological foundation towards commercializing DSIF for rapid prototyping and low volume production of sheet metal parts.\r\n\r\nThe broader/ commercial potential of this project is to significantly reduce the cost of rapid prototyping and low volume fabrication of quality sheet metal components by eliminating the need for expensive die sets. The inclusion of deformation mechanics into DSIF toolpath planning will establish a strong connection between the toolpath and the final geometry and stresses of the formed product in DSIF. Consequently, the iterative experimental procedure for optimum toolpath generation will be replaced by a structured, scientific and more robust toolpath generation methodology. The advantages of DSIF as compared to conventional forming include absence of expensive shape specific tooling (up to $1M each), higher formability (4 times higher) and reduced forming forces (30% lower). Greater formability in DSIF will allow light-weighting and enhanced fuel efficiency, leading to further energy savings. The cost of storing legacy die sets will be eliminated by DSIF, since only part models in the electronic format will be needed for re-fabrication of parts.",
