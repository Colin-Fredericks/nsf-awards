 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research analyzes how domestic violence claims move from NGO sites to civil courts in New Delhi, India. The hypothesis guiding the study is that the way domestic violence claims are presented by women and institutional actors is more important to case outcomes than the specific content of claims. This is because the content of domestic violence cases in the Indian legal system tends to vary relatively little. Consequently, it is expected that case presentation will largely determine whether women's grievances are recognized.  The project will analyze how different forms of evidence are presented under the law, both when cases are initially heard in the NGO site and when they are disputed in civil court. The study will focus on the form and content of evidentiary presentations. Specifically, it will investigate how women's voices in the initial complaint are translated into written evidence of abuse by the NGO. It will then explore how women and their written claims travel into the courtroom, where they are evaluated alongside other evidence, such as competing testimonies, and media such as home snapshots. The research examines how claims are subjected to moral evaluation during the trial and what is at stake in using one evidentiary genre, versus another, in establishing obligations between kin. The project will consist of ten months of ethnographic fieldwork.  \r\n\r\nBy examining how claims are presented, and ultimately, assessed under the law, the project will contribute to a better understanding of legal services provisions generally, as well as specifically in the research site.",

Women avail these laws - a combination of civil and criminal remedies- in the court system, but prior to court, many women have their cases heard and documented at non-legal sites such as NGOs and police stations. Thus there are a multiplicity of sites where women&rsquo;s claims can be heard and negotiated, and in many cases, domestic matters are handled at the local, neighborhood level before filing official legal paperwork. This ethnographic project was carried out for eighteen months in New Delhi, India. The aim of the project was to explore the trajectory of domestic claims from informal to formal sites of the law. The project focused on the following three questions: 1) how did women share their private suffering with institutional and other non-familial actors? 2) how were women&rsquo;s expressions and complaints mediated into case material, for a potential case in court? and 3) how did women&rsquo;s stories and voices feature in the court, itself? The project used a number of research strategies: 1) observations and field notes of interactions between women and staff at two different NGO sites in Delhi; 2) longitudinal tracking of cases that traveled from sites such NGOs and shelters, to courtrooms; 3) observation of court scenes; 4) the construction of a research archive of legal documents from the Delhi District Court and the Delhi High Court; and 5) an archive of digital recordings of Indian television programs and newspaper clippings addressing domestic violence laws.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit: </em></strong>First, the project expanded upon previous anthropological work on gender and expressive traditions in India. It did this by documenting women&rsquo;s complaints not only in rural settings or women&rsquo;s spaces but also in the public realm by examining women&rsquo;s engagement with institutions such as NGOs and courts. Secondly the project contributed to work in legal studies on the fragmentation of the Indian state into a number of entities for administering law and justice &ndash; it explored the intricate continuities and impasses between informal settings and the court of law. Settings analyzed included places such as neighbourhoods, village councils, political groups, NGOs, and police. Thirdly, the project challenged the scholarly notion of the law as a total patriarchal authority. Instead it focused on legal measures that bring women&rsquo;s complaints to the fore, at the same time as these complaints are managed and evaluated. Thus it paints a picture of the law as containing different regions, impulses, as well contradictions. Finally, the project made a significant contribution to studies of gender and South Asian domesticity by investigating how domestic disputes become a matter of public and official concern.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts: </em></strong>1. Integration of research and education: The project is being written up into a manuscript-length dissertation and a series of journal articles for publication. The research will also give rise to several undergraduate courses, for example, courses on law and the social world, gender violence and law in South Asia, and institutional ethnography. 2. Participation of underrepresented groups: The project explored the circumstances of women from lower-income and marginalized groups, and how these women navigate the legal system. 3.
