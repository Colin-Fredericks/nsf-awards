This crucial subproject is designed to provide fundamental insights required for the design of electron transfer pathways generally as well as the engineering and evolution of a specific photosynthetic hydrogen-producing pathway.  The project will develop and apply methods that enable the evolution of a fusion protein that docks at photosystem I on a thylakoid membrane.  The fusion protein will also be engineered and evolved to efficiently transfer electrons from the photosystem to an [FeFe] hydrogenase.  The specific aims include (i)development of a high-throughput in vitro screen for hydrogen production driven by photosynthesis; (ii)engineering of a ferredoxin-hydrogenase fusion enzyme that produces hydrogen by coupling to photosystem I and (iii) the characterization of the productivity and oxygen sensitivity of the engineered photosynthetic hydrogen production system. \r\nThe broader impacts are significant both for training and technological applications.  It will teach collaboration, teamwork and communication skills to a diverse group of students including minorities.  The broader application of the principles revealed by this program could reshape the energy and chemical industries and help to provide a sustainable global socio-economic system.",

The final technology will allow us to use land unsuitable for raising crops to sustainably produce hydrogen as a fuel and an important raw material for making chemicals, especially nitrogen fertilizer. This technology would help maintain U.S. energy independence without significantly worsening global warming while also avoiding the need for the scarce and expensive metals used in alternative technologies.

In the native organism, a complex of proteins called photosystem II uses sunlight to split water, and a partnering complex called photosystem I (PSI) absorbs more light to boost the energy of the released electrons. PSI then sends these boosted electrons to other parts of the organism where CO&shy;<sub>2</sub> is captured and used to make biochemicals, proteins, and other cellular components.

This enzyme combines the electrons with protons (also derived from water splitting) to make the hydrogen. Of course, water also contains an oxygen atom and, during water splitting, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is released as a necessary by-product of photosynthesis. The oxygen causes problems since it can steal electrons from the photosystems and the electron carriers. This essentially forms a short circuit that lowers energy efficiency.&nbsp; In addition, the oxygen can severely damage the [FeFe]-hydrogenase, killing its ability to make hydrogen.
