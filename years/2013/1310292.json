 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nIn the past 15 years, research into nanoreinforced polymers has exploded, providing numerous examples of property enhancements ranging from altered thermal, mechanical, electrical, diffusion, optical and other properties. The amount of experimental data and simulation data, compounded with the data on the individual constituent phase materials is staggering. At the same time, while some mechanistic principles underlying property changes have been slowly uncovered, our ability to both deeply understand the underlying principles and to design new nanostructured polymers with desired properties from known processing steps is severely limited by the lack of integration of the information. To determine the type of property changes that have been observed requires manual searching of online journal databases, full reading of the articles, and manual accumulation and then synthesis of the information. This approach ensures that many relevant papers and articles are overlooked and allows only rudimentary synthesis of data and understanding of the processing-structure-property relationships. The birth of the materials genome concept provides a new paradigm for developing understanding of materials and designing new material concepts. In this research project, we tackle this challenge in the domain of polymer nanocomposites. While the materials genome approach has had some success in the metals field, the polymers area is considerably less developed and no resources exist for nanocomposite systems. Yet with the infinite design space available to polymer nanocomposites, it is a prime system for a new data driven approach. The Intellectual Merit of the work is application of materials genome concepts to the complex material system of polymer nanocomposites, with the goal of uncovering the processing-structure-property relationships. The overarching framework is to consider the material response as a function of processing conditions, constituents, interactions and morphology. Specific accomplishments include 1) development of a data resource (NanoMine) for housing and exchange of polymer nanocomposite data, 2) development of reduced descriptor sets to characterize data and quantify structure, and development of new data mining methods to enable discovery of underlying material physics, 3) integration of simulation tools to augment experimental data and enable exploration of design concepts. The Broader Impacts of the work are the NanoMine data resource itself, the new data-driven approach for materials understanding and discovery, and through use of these tools the ability to make deeper connections between processing, resulting material morphology and properties. The creation of an open-source, freely accessible data resource will provide not only a fast and easy source of information, but will also link researchers together in new ways. The data driven approach applied to this one system of nanocomposites, will provide strategies that can be extended to other material systems, greatly extending its influence. We will also integrate research and education through interdisciplinary graduate education including a special project based course. We will include undergraduates in our research program. This cadre of graduate and undergraduate students will have an interdisciplinary approach to materials discovery. We will also reach out to the broader community through NU and RPI High School outreach days (such as Design Your Future Day and Career Day for Girls) and teach them about Materials Design and data driven research.\r\n\r\nNon-technicalAbstract\r\n\r\nDevelopment of nanoparticle reinforced polymers in the past 15 years has created new materials with extraordinary properties - such as conducting yet transparent plastics, tennis balls that retain their bounce longer, and stiffer, stronger structural plastics for cars and airplanes. Yet the development of these advanced new materials has been very slow due to lack of integrated information, both experimental data and simulation tools. Currently, understanding the state of the field requires manual searching of online journal databases, full reading of the articles, and manual accumulation and then synthesis of the information. No resources yet exist for assembling the data, nor do tools exist to allow assembled data to be effectively mined for correlations, much less to enable rapid design of new materials. In this research, we will develop a data resource (NanoMine) for housing and exchange of polymer nanocomposite data and development of new data mining methods to enable discovery of underlying material physics. We will integrate of simulation tools to augment experimental data and enable exploration of design concepts.  The creation of an open-source, freely accessible data resource will provide a fast and easy source of information, and will enable both fundamental new understanding of materials as well as much more efficient material design. The data driven approach applied to this one system of nanocomposites, will provide strategies that can be extended to other material systems, greatly extending its influence. We will also integrate research and education in several ways from K-12 through to practicing engineers.",

The current production website (<a href=\"http://puma.mech.northwestern.edu:8000/\">http://nanomine.northwestern.edu</a>) contains three major components: a <strong>database, a suite of analysis tools, </strong>and <strong>simulation capabilities</strong><strong> (</strong>as shown in Figures 1 and 2).<strong> </strong>In addition to the production site for public access, a development site is hosted to serve the developers from different institutions to design and test visualization techniques, an intuitive searching interface, user management, job scheduling, and improved web application and database integration. The current system contains data from over 1000 samples gathered from over 180 papers and over 30 samples curated directly from collaborating contributors; five statistical learning tools for microstructure and polymer data preprocessing are available to users; and three simulation and modeling packages to predict viscoelastic and dielectric properties are housed on the website.</p>\n<p>The current <strong>database</strong> implementation is a beta web interface system using the Material Data Curator System (MDCS, ver. 1.3) developed at National Institute of Science and Standards (NIST) as the base infrastructure for nanocomposite material data curation, exploration and analysis (Figure 3). This system provides the backbone of cyberinfrastructure including a model-view-controller web framework, structured and flexible data format, and handy data exchange protocols. We added features to the original MDCS in order to best accommodate polymer nanocomposite materials data with a detailed, hierarchical, re-usable data schema that describes metadata, materials characteristics, processing conditions, composite properties, and microstructure of nanocomposite samples. The most recent version of the schema is able to handle various forms of data reported from literature, including 1, 2 and 3-D data for materials properties, generalized processing steps for synthesis of nanocomposites, and images and metadata of microstructure of experimental samples. All data is fully annotated in the developed schema and thus available for data mining, search, and visualization tools. Continuous data curation continues and as the website goes public more data will be self-curated by the community. A special issue of a journal is in the planning stage to encourage data archival in tandem with paper publication.</p>\n<p>In addition to the database, NanoMine also provides <strong>analysis tools</strong> for quantitative investigation of curated data to assist with material selection and property prediction (Figure 4). We have implemented three tools related to microstructure analysis as open, web-based modules and are continuing to develop and publish new methodology for mining and analysis of data. We have also published a tool for polymer data-preprocessing which computes the polymer master curve Prony Series using an optimization method. A user can upload master curve data files and obtain the Prony Series coefficients with corresponding relaxation times, which can be downloaded for post-processing or further use. A user can make use of the microstructure analysis tools to process images, extract geometric descriptors, and reconstruct a 2D input into a statistically equivalent 3D microstructure. A typical workflow involves: 1) a grayscale micrograph input is converted to binary image consisting of polymer and particle phases using dynamic local threshold algorithms; 2) the dispersion, geometry and other microstructure characteristics can be quantified into statistical descriptors, which can be used further in data mining approaches; 3) a pixel moving method is used to create statistically equivalent 3D microstructures which exhibit the same microstructure characteristics as the original images. The final reconstructed 3D morphology can then be used in the third component of NanoMine for deterministic analysis and modeling.</p>\n<p>The third component of NanoMine consists of physics-based <strong>simulation tools</strong> to predict viscoelastic or dielectric nanocomposite properties based on explicit microstructure and interphase models. The user can supply these input models, or the microstructure can be derived using the tools in the second component; the interphase properties can be derived from surface and mixing energies using linked software developed separately from this project. In the ideal complete workflow, a user will start from a defined set of molecular constituents to derive energetic terms that represent constituent interactions. Interphase properties and microstructure dispersion will then be predicted from interfacial energies under statistical correlations. At the final step, the FEA model uses input from microstructure and material properties (polymer, particle, and the interphase) to simulate continuum composite response.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we will continue to build on the current version of NanoMine to add more data, analysis tools and prediction/design tools. The long term goal is a user friendly, living, open data resource to assist users in archiving important data, finding relevant data for their projects, and providing useful analysis and design tools. The resources will advance development of nanocomposites for applications due to accelerated understanding, property prediction and top down material design.
