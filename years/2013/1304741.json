 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser-driven collisions of electrons and atoms--so-called \"recollisions\"-- are a key process in ultrastrong lasers. Understanding their role in various laser field configurations is potentially very rewarding for tracking the motion of giant molecules by taking their snapshots in real time. A mechanism which accounts for the rich physics in these strong laser fields is urgently needed. In particular, the impact of recolliding electrons \"hitching rides\" on special orbits on their way to and from the atom will be researched using mechanical models.        \r\n\r\nMechanical treatments of atoms are the perfect physics education and training tool because they allow many atomic properties to be understood pictorially and with comparatively little effort. In addition to graduate student training,  undergraduate research projects on classical dynamics will be a component of this research program, as will advising mathematics and science teachers at high schools and technical colleges on pedagogical aspects of atoms. This research is often viewed as a valuable source for applications by mathematicians, and a source of new insights by chemists and therefore serves to strengthen the research infrastructure.",
