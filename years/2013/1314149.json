Abundant time will be permitted for informal interactions among attendees, and everyone can present either a poster or invited talk.  The 2013 meeting creates an associated Gordon Research Seminar immediately preceding the GRC, designed to foster interactions among younger scientists, who are mentored by two established investigators that provide valuable feedback on oral and poster communications.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that strong recruitment of young minds is vital to the field, speakers in the 2013 conference will include postdoctoral researchers and early-career investigators, as well as internationally-renowned senior scientists, also broadening participation by fostering gender and ethnic diversity at the podium.  Meeting results will be disseminated through primary-journal articles, as well as reviews and lay-public magazine articles. The proceedings will have broad societal impact due to their relevance to biomedicine and industrial microbiology.",
