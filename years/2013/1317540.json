 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, \"Graduate 10K+,\" an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade. The aim of this particular project is to significantly increase 1st and 2nd year retention rates and graduation rates in engineering and computer science at Syracuse University. Towards this end the project is re-forming the undergraduate experience into one with a more welcoming climate, promoting strong faculty-student interactions and best practices in engineering education. In particular, the project team is focusing on a multi-pronged approach to improving the quality of instruction and academic advising through a synergistic series of activities including: a well-supported faculty development program in best practices in engineering education; the complete re-design of the first semester gateway engineering course with help from Bucknell University faculty;  implementation of innovative pedagogy in target 1st and 2nd year classes; guidance for faculty in their advising practice and establishment of a framework for continuous quality improvement in academic advising; and extension of previously tested first year academic support and community building programs into the second year. \r\n\r\nThis project has the capacity to transform engineering and computer science education at Syracuse University, and to serve as a model for other STEM departments on campus and at other universities. It is designed to meet the national need to graduate more engineers and computer scientists who will help to fuel the American economy, as well as contribute creative solutions to technological challenges. The emphasis on improving the climate is expected to have a positive impact on all students, but most especially on students from underrepresented groups and women. Furthermore, in the process of creating institutional change, the individual faculty members are gaining lifelong teaching and advising skills that can carry through their practice at Syracuse University or wherever they may be faculty in the future.",

This has led to substantial increases in retention and graduation rates in engineering and computer science since the start of the project. Since 2013, the 2-year retention rate has increased by 18 percentage points and the six-year graduation rate has increased by 14.5 percentage points. This translates into nearly 50 more engineering and computer science graduates per cohort who can enter the workforce and meet the national demand for highly skilled STEM workers. &nbsp;Faculty participation in these efforts has been robust, with over 75% of ECS faculty engaging in professional development opportunities offered through the project, including workshops, seminars, book clubs, course redesign programs, and mini-grant programs. At least 32 undergraduate courses in the college have been redesigned or significantly revised over the past four years to incorporate more hands-on and active learning as a direct result of this work. This includes all gateway courses in ECS, defined as 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> year courses that are required by multiple majors, and the first semester Introduction to Engineering course that is taught in discipline-specific sections. Additionally academic support has also been added for these courses in the form of peer-led team learning (PLTL) Academic Excellence Workshops (AEW), which have been correlated with increased retention and graduation rates. This support has been institutionalized and will continue beyond the end of the project. Retention and graduation rates have also been bolstered by systemic changes to academic advising in ECS, which have helped to create a more supportive climate and enhanced relationships between students and faculty and students and professional staff. This was accomplished through the development of a comprehensive and holistic advising model, which was implemented in Fall 2018 with the support of institutional funding to hire professional advising staff in career services and student success. Undergraduate students in ECS are each assigned a team of three advisors &ndash; a faculty academic advisor in their major, a success advisor, and a career advisor &ndash; and this team stays with them from matriculation through graduation. Students overwhelmingly report that they establish meaningful and supportive relationships with their advising team, which enhances their desire to persist in their major. Retention rates have increased sharply since the new advising model was implemented and so has overall student success, as evidence by steep declines in academic probation rates. We expect that these strategies will have long-term impacts in our college because they have transformed the way that many of our faculty teach and advise students. Our findings suggest that well-resourced faculty development programs, incentives and support for faculty to improve their teaching, and holistic undergraduate advising all have a positive impact on the climate for student persistence and success in engineering and computer science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hasenwinkel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
