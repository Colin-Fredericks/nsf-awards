 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterial pathogens of plants can pose a serious agricultural threat by causing substantial losses in food productivity.  One goal of research into plant immune systems is to understand how plants naturally recognize and defend themselves against pathogenic bacteria, with the possibility of introducing effective disease resistance pathways into susceptible plants.  Although certain bacteria-recognition systems have been extensively characterized in plants, not all plants have the components necessary to sense all microbial pathogens; certain bacteria have evolved to stay \"below the radar\" of at least some of the plant's surveillance mechanisms.  Having recently discovered that a little-studied feature of the pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the \"Type 6 Secretion System\" (T6SS), activates plant defenses, the project will use biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate how the plant detects the T6SS on the bacterium, and how the plant responds once it has perceived the T6SS.  These studies will elucidate a previously unknown protection strategy used by plants to defend themselves against bacteria.  Since many bacteria have a T6SS, introducing a T6SS-specific recognition system could conceivably enhance the resistance of plants to bacterial diseases, with fewer of the adverse ecological and health effects associated with the chemical pesticides typically used to control bacterial infection in the field.  \r\n\r\nThe project fully integrates research and education, in that the experiments will be performed primarily by undergraduate students, with one post-doctoral fellow providing continuity.  Through independent research and investigative semester-long projects in courses taught by the PI, more than 40 undergraduates will have the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research on the plant immune system.  This project uses the paradigm of plant disease resistance to inculcate critical thinking skills and foster independence in experimental design that will benefit students, whether or not they pursue a career in research.",

One goal of research into the plant?s immune system is to better understand how plants naturally defend themselves against bacteria, with the possibility of introducing those disease resistance pathways into susceptible plants.  Although certain bacteria-recognition systems have been extensively characterized in plants, not all plants have the components necessary to sense these well-studied microbial harbingers, and certain bacteria have evolved to stay \"below the radar\" of at least some of the plant?s surveillance mechanisms.  This project explored how a recently discovered bacterial feature, the \"Type 6 Secretion System\" (T6SS), both subverts and activates plant defenses.  We studied this process in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil bacterium that infects a wide variety of host plants and causes \"plant cancer\" (tumor formation) by injecting part of its own DNA into the host plant.  \n\n \n\nIn our experiments, we asked two sets of questions: What specific features of the T6SS are responsible for manipulating the host plant?s defenses?  What defense pathways in the host plant are impacted by the bacterium?s T6SS? To address the first question, we used mutant bacteria lacking one or more proteins that the bacteria normally secrete through the T6SS.  We found that one of these secreted proteins was particularly important in promoting tumor formation, while a second secreted protein appeared to trigger host defenses.  To address the second question, we monitored specific plant defense genes and asked which ones were turned up or down by the bacterium and its T6SS.

The role of these pathways in response to Agrobacterium tumefaciens is complex and poorly understood in comparison to the well-characterized defenses that plants mount against other bacterial pathogens.  Our data are, to our knowledge, the first to identify impacts of a bacterial T6SS on these host plant pathways.\n\n \n\nThe project fully integrated research and education, in that the experiments were performed primarily by undergraduate students, with one post-doctoral fellow providing continuity.
