 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lincoln's Excellence Academic Program in the Sciences (LEAPS) Scholars Program is supporting two cohorts of academically talented students in attaining baccalaureate degrees in biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics, environmental science, or biochemistry and molecular biology at Lincoln University. In addition to scholarship aid, the project is providing support through a living-and-learning community, coordinated supplemental instruction, and mentoring to assist students with research and internship opportunities while at Lincoln and with transitions to post-baccalaureate employment and/or graduate programs.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in its thoughtful analysis of the challenges faced by Lincoln students in pursuit of STEM degrees and the well-planned response that combines recruitment and financial and academic support. The broader impacts include diversification of the STEM workforce through increased graduation from this Historically Black University, as well as providing a model for similar institutions in the region and beyond.",
