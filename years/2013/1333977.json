 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a microstructure-mediated design methodology that provides a seamless integration of design optimization, predictive materials modeling, processing and surface engineering, to enable accelerated discovery and development of new materials.  Through the synergy of experts in engineering design, mechanics, and materials science, a descriptor-based computational microstructure design framework and a combined theoretical, computational, and experimental approach to design new microstructural systems with tailored system properties.  Using emerging nanodielectric polymer systems as a testbed, final proof of concept will reside in design of filler morphology, interphase properties, and chemistry combinations for achieving specific mechanical and dielectric properties for a wide range of engineering applications. The computational microstructure design framework will create a shift from discovery-based materials development to systematic and computer-assisted materials design. This research will also make significant strides in predicting interphase behavior based on interaction of material constituents. \r\n\r\nThe results of this research could have important societal impact through innovations of new nanodielectric polymers used in electrical transmission and storage systems across a wide range of industries such as utility, energy, consumer electronics, and manufacturing.  Since this research provides a general methodology for designing microstructural material systems, the techniques will transcend to broader applications and benefit a wide range of domestic and military applications.  To disseminate the results to a broader community, a workshop on \"Design of Emerging Microstructural Material Systems\" will be organized.  Research will be integrated with education and students will have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary materials system design projects that offer innovation and leadership experiences.",

The addition of nanoscale (~15-50nm) spherical nanoparticles has been found to significantly increase the dielectric breakdown strength of polymers and can also be used to tailor the dielectric constant and loss (related to the capacitance and loss of energy during electrical transmission).\n\nIntellectual Merit: This award has led to progress in developing a design methodology for faster development of nanodielectric materials.   There were two key components to the project: 1. careful and detailed experimental work that created a unique data set of quantified processing, filler organization, and property values, and 2.  models and design tools that used the data set for validation and development.  While not ready for commercial use, significant progress and understanding resulted from the project.  In addition, the data set and tools have been integrated into a new materials data resource NanoMine (open source) that is being built for the broader nanocomposites community to share data, metadata and tools for nanocomposite characterization and prediction.  \n\nBroader Impacts: The project partically supported two graduate students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and several more at Northwestern University who were educated in a highly interdisciplinary research group with broad research group meetings twice a month.  The students learned to not only collaborate across disciplines, but across universities.  \n\nThere were several publications that resulted from this work direclty, and several more that were impacted by it periferally.  In addition, there were over 20 public presentations of the work around the world that educated a host of scientists and engineers on not only the design approaches, but the fundamental understanding of dielectrics that resulted.  The audiences were from both industry and academia, and thus the new understanding is available to industry as they develop new nanodielectric products.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda Schadler"
