 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Sherrill is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Computational Science and Data-enabled Science and Engineering Program to develop computational methods, algorithms and software for studying non-covalent interactions.  Non-covalent interactions are central to protein folding, drug docking, crystal packing, and solvation.  Recent experiments provide detailed data on organic model systems meant to isolate and quantify individual non-covalent interactions in solution, yet they remain hard to understand without the aid of theory.  This project seeks to unravel the various factors influencing non-covalent interactions in these experimental organic systems. The Sherrill group is \r\n(1)  Developing faster algorithms for density functional theory (DFT) geometry optimization and frequency analysis, using density fitting techniques.\r\n(2)  Expanding the available set of benchmark-quality non-covalent interaction energies from a few hundred to several thousand, using test cases taken directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).  This data is critical for validating and parameterizing theoretical models of non-covalent interactions.\r\n(3) Identifying synergistic approximations in coupled-cluster theory to accelerate the computations in Goal (2), using combinations of density-fitting, natural orbitals, and rank-reduction techniques.\r\n(4)  Performing detailed studies of experimental model complexes of CH/pi and pi-pi interactions to better understand these interactions, how they operate in solution, and how they might be more effectively modeled.\r\n\r\nThe Sherrill group develops and uses computational methods to better understand non-bonded interactions between molecules.  Such interactions control how drugs find their targets and how molecular crystals form.  Hence, this research provides knowledge useful for advances in rational drug design and crystal engineering.  This project provides improved theoretical and computational methods for modeling such non-bonded interactions through (a) improved computer algorithms to compute interactions more quickly, and (b) generation of a large database of high-quality benchmark data that can be used to test and improve new theoretical models of non-bonded contacts.  The benchmark data will be made publicly available through a web portal.  The software developed will be freely released under an open-source license.  This project provides training for students not only in how to use molecular modeling software, but also in how to write molecular modeling software.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project developed improved theoretical models for molecules based on high-accuracy quantum mechanics.  Much of our effort was focused on coupled-cluster theory, in particular a method called coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)].  This method is called the \"gold standard\" of quantum chemistry because it is very accurate.  Unfortunately, it is also very slow, and computations using this method can take a long time to complete, even on a fast computer (for larger molecules, CCSD(T) computations aren't even possible at all).  We found some ways to speed up CCSD(T) computations without adding much error.  In particular, the density-fitting (DF) and frozen natural orbital (FNO) approximations work well with CCSD(T), and they work well together.  We derived the appropritate equations, implemented the new methods as efficient computer programs, and used the programs for some interesting chemical applications.  All our software developed under this project is released to the public as free, open-source software at www.psicode.org.  We hope this software will help other scientists in their own projects.\n\nWe used our DF-FNO CCSD(T) program to compute, for the first time, a very accurate value for the lattice energy of crystalline benzene that includes contributions from trimers of benzene molecules.  The size of this \"three-body\" contribution to the lattice energy has been in debate for some time.  Our values are able to resolve the debate and show which approximate methods were reliable for this value, and which ones failed.  This work shows that accurate lattice energies of organic crystals are now within reach of computational models.  This is of great importance because drug molecules might be made in one crystalline form, but they might convert to a different crystalline form over time that might render them useless as drugs.  Being able to compute accurate crystal lattice energies could help scientists investigate whether this could be a problem for particular drugs.\n\nUsing very accurate CCSD(T) computations, we were able to test some more approximate theoretical methods.  We developed an improvement to the very popular -D correction for London dispersion forces in density functional theory (DFT).  This correction is available through our Psi4 software.\n\nWe developed new theoretical methods and new software for symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), which allows us to compute the attraction between two molecules.  Our big innovations were: (a) we extended SAPT to provide the interactions between different parts of molecules, so we can analyze interactions in more detail.  This would be of special importance to understanding how individual contacts lead to good binding between drug molecules and proteins.  (b) We found a way to perform SAPT on interactions within a single molecule (this was not possible with the original SAPT theory).\n\nWe used these tools to get a better understanding of the crystal packing of molecules relevant for organic electronics, and for various prototypes of intermolecular interactions.\n\nBeyond the straight scientific accomplishments of this award, we contributed to the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in theoretical chemistry, supermolecular chemistry, computer programming, and computational science.  We also developed a lot of polished software (with documentation) for use by the general scientific community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles D Sherrill"
