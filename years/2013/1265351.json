 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to apply emerging technologies (e.g. dynamic spectrum sharing) to address the wireless spectrum shortage problem, there is a critical need to understand global RF spectrum usage trends. To accomplish this, a three-pronged approach is being pursued:  1) deployment of geographically dispersed, temporally coordinated RF spectrum observatories in multiple U.S. locations, and through international collaboration, in Finland. The spectrum observatories use a common platform generating a single RF spectrum measurement dataset. 2) Development of empirically validated, statistical models of spectrum utilization for different wireless application types based on this dataset. 3) Use of \"big data\" analytical techniques to mine the dataset to discover temporal and spectral correlations not obvious using traditional approaches. As the models and relationships are refined, they will enable temporal and spectral occupancy predictions to support spectrum sharing for various circumstances and wireless applications.\r\n\r\nThe generation of a high-resolution, multi-location, multi-national spectrum usage dataset using a common, consistent measurement and storage approach is unique and allows direct, unambiguous comparisons of spectrum usage across geographies and demographics. The statistical models of spectrum utilization and the identified similarities and differences between regions and wireless services are unique and inform dynamic spectrum sharing research and related regulatory action with \"real-world\" data. Importantly, this is the first time that \"big data\" analytic approaches are being systematically applied to RF utilization data providing new insights motivating novel dynamic spectrum sharing approaches and improved spectrum efficiency.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Global RF Spectrum Opportunity Assessment project was a great success in that it enable researchers from five organization (two U.S. - Virginia Tech and Illinois Institute of Technology and two Finnish Universities - University of Oulu and Turku University of Applied Science and a Finnish Research Institute - VTT) to collaboratively build the infrastructure to make and store global spectrum measurements and perform associated analyses and visualization work on their measurements.  In this process a great deal of data was gathered in Turku, Finland, London, England, and in the U.S., Blacksburg, VA and Chicago, IL.  This data was in turn analyzed using various well-established and in some cases relatively new techniques.  As a component of this analysis work, comparisons were made between the spectrum data and information about the environment in which the spectrum data was taken.  Happily, initiatives such as the City's Open Data Initiative in Chicago enabled this comparison work to be done with relative ease and with a high level of timing granularity. \n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy achievement from the physical infrastructure perspective was the implementation of five nearly identical spectrum observation stations.  These were located in four fixed locations (2 in Chicago, 1 in Blacksburg, VA and 1 in Turku, Finland) and one mobile, \"backpack\" unit that was used in several locations in Finland.  These stations provided the spectrum measurements that were the basis for the various spectrum comparisons made between the four plus physical sites where spectrum measurement efforts were undertaken.  The data was collected and ultimately stored in a large data storage facility located at Illinois Institute of Technology. This facility is in turn connected to the campus Internet backhaul with a 10 GHz link to enable high speed sharing of data with interested parties in industry, government and academia.\n\nSeveral new visualization approaches were also developed and utilized through this program including the creation of the International Spectrum Observation Center (ISOC).  This Center is physically composed of six 55 inch flat screen monitors supported by a high performance computing and networking infrastructure that allows for example the simultaneous streaming of six separate real-time spectrum measurement data streams.  The screens can also display public Internet broadcast news feeds, historic spectrum data in various formats (waterfall charts, Power Spectral Density, etc.).  The system also provides a \"Zoom\" capability to allow a monitor to display up to 6 GHz worth of data or to \"zoom in\" on a few Kilohertz of spectral measurement information.  Finally, the screens can be joined to provide one large image of the spectrum being observed as shown in the second of the attached images.  The two attached Images shows the ISOC in action in two different modalities.  \n\nBeyond the technical achievements of the group, the opportunity to share weekly Skype interactions supplemented by conference meetings and yearly in-person WiFiUS interactions at the Faculty and student level across the five organization was a very positive aspect of the program.  This promoted cultural exchanges of various forms between the groups.  Gaining an enhanced understanding of the related spectrum policy dynamics in the U.S. and Europe and comparing those with the efforts at the ITU-R was another particularly gratifying aspect to the research program.\n\nOverall, this program was a significant success from the scientific, infrastructure development, and the personal develop and enhanced cultural understanding perspectives.  It is hoped that this program will be continued and that others will have similar opportunities in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis A Roberson"
