 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary history of land plants over the last 500 million years is characterized by periodic bursts of diversification following major climatic shifts, specific geologic events, or the evolution of specific characters. Speciation is then so rapid that the relationships among descendants are hard to identify, and large sets of data are needed to resolve the family tree. The moss lineage Hypnanae underwent an explosive radiation following its origin 165 mya. Today, it comprises about 5,000 species, but their grouping into evolutionary units is obscure. Inferences from extensive sets of genes sampled using a gene enrichment strategy combined with gene expression data will provide a robust framework to further our understanding of this diverse, and ecologically important lineage.\r\n\r\nThis study focuses on untangling the relationships among species that arose from an explosive diversification, on identifying the geologic or climatic shifts that triggered these events, and on understanding the significance of morphological innovations allowing adaptations to diverse habitats. The target group of mosses is more diverse than conifers, dominates some communities, and plays critical ecological roles throughout the world. Resolving the patterns and processes underlying the rise of a diverse lineage offers an opportunity to understand how these organisms may respond to rapid global change.",

The &ldquo;Hypnanae&rdquo; compose, with about 5000 species, the most diverse major lineage of mosses. However, their grouping into evolutionary units has been obscured by rapid bursts of speciation. The evolution of this group is characterized by an explosive radiation shortly after its origin some 165 million years ago, and multiple shifts in habitats, followed by the loss of typically complex traits. Today, the Hypnanae comprise about 5,000 species distributed across all major ecosystems where they often regulate local nutrient flow. Although highly diverse and of ecological significance, their grouping into evolutionary units has been a recalcitrant problem in evolutionary biology. This study, led by a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut, the Chicago Botanic Garden, and Duke University focused on resolving the evolutionary history of mosses, identifying the closest living relatives of the hyperdiverse Hypnanae and untangling the relationships among species complexes that arose from an explosive diversification. The team sampled all protein coding genes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and over 800 protein coding nuclear genes for about 400 species of mosses, compiling the largest dataset for any lineage of land plant to date. Furthermore, the project generated thousands of additional nuclear gene sequenced that were expressed in close to a hundred species. These genomic data revealed novel signatures of whole genome duplications that occurred throughout the evolution of mosses, and thereby strengthened the view that the mosses, although of ancient origin, undergo processes of diversification similar to those observed in flowering plants. The team advanced knowledge of the evolution of mosses by reconstructing the relationships based on an extensive set of genetic markers from all cellular genomes. In particular, it proposed novel relationships among orders of mosses, identified the closest relative of the Hypnanae, and reconstructed the first robust evolutionary history for this diverse and cosmopolitan group of mosses.
