 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, provide important tests of cosmology, and serve as rich astrophysical laboratories for events such as mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outbursts.  As tracers of the evolution of structure, clusters of galaxies represent an important cosmological tool, and this project aims to directly measure the pressure profile in the intracluster medium of clusters to advance our understanding of cluster physics.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to map the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy clusters at 90 GHz with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) with a combination of unprecedented mapping speed, resolution, and sky coverage.  Using the MUSTANG-1.5 instrument, the investigators will image a statistically significant set of X-ray and SZE selected sample of massive clusters in three seasons and will observationally determine the scatter in cluster-mass/SZE observable scaling relations due to cluster mergers, AGN feedback, and other astrophysical processes.\r\n\r\nEducationally, the principal investigator will also provide valuable research experiences to undergraduate and high school students by bringing them into the research program to assist, and even run, remote observing sessions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe MUSTANG instrument on the Green Bank Telescope has ended this work with exceptionally positive results.   During the first two years of the award, we were observing with only a small fraction of the detectors filling the MUSTANG focal plane.  Thanks to some additional funding from the NSF, in the spring of 2016, we were able to install a complete set of detectors.  We were also able to complete the development of a new state-of-the-art detector multiplexing system called a microwave MUX.  This system, first run on MUSTANG, is now a leading contender for future CMB-S4 technology.  It is very unlikely this work have worked out so well without NSF support.\n\n \n\nWe installed the fully-functioning receiver on the GBT in the fall of 2016.  The integration went very well and we quickly set about doing test observations.   The attached image is of the Orion Filament.  The image on the left was taken with our old MUSTANG instrument with 14 hours of integration.  The picture on the right was taken with the new instrument in only 40 minutes.  We were very excited by the result which confirmed that the 3 milllimeter emission was much higher than expected, possibly pointing to anomalous dust emission in the fillement.\n\n \n\nWe have been very successful getting time on the GBT to observe with MUSTANG.  The season has not seen the best weather, but we have still been able to build up a significant amount of time on selected clusters observations.  The software pipeline is a work in progress which now involves many more detectors over a larger field of view.  Based on the map noise we are currently achieving, we expect to be getting results from our cluster maps soon.\n\n \n\nWe will continue to apply for time for fall observations with MUSTANG.  With our new results in hand, we will be able to make a strong case for a significant amount of time to work our way through our list of high-profile clusters.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark J Devlin"
