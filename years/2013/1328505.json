 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groundwater withdrawals in the western US are a critical component of the water resources strategy for the region. Recharge estimation methods include water balance accounting, groundwater modeling, remote sensing, observational methods and environmental tracer analysis.  This project will assemble a team of investigators to synthesize current understanding of recharge in the West and how it may respond to climate change in the coming decades.  The synthesis will build on previous work that quantified major aquifer systems within the United States under the USGS-Regional-Aquifer-System-Analysis program.  The synthesis will (1) draw upon geographically targeted process-based studies of recharge controls and their sensitivity to climatic forcing in various parts of the region; (2) take advantage of recently available dynamically downscaled climate-change projections; (3) meld process-exploring results from high-resolution water balance studies and modeling analyses.   These approaches will be used to develop enhanced estimates of groundwater recharge (with estimated uncertainties) and a detailed list of research needs will be developed for more robust estimates of groundwater recharge across the region.  This project is cooperative with the USGS John Wesley Powell Center Science Board.  \r\n\r\nThis project will significantly advance regional knowledge of the controls on groundwater recharge and the impact this has on regional water sustainability for the US southwest.  By synthesizing the state of knowledge as well as the best methods of analysis and reanalysis, the project will define new methods (and better estimates) of regional scale groundwater recharge.  The project will also significantly impact water resource and water management strategy for the southwest by providing an improved basis for long timescale analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nClimate change is expected to alter the precipitation and temperature regimes of the Western United States.  While significant attention has been paid to how surface water resources such as the Colorado River, Rio Grande and Columbia might respond to these changes less has been paid to the response of ground water resources.  This absence of understanding led to the development of the John Wesley Powell Center group that this NSF project supported.  The products of our group fall in the realm of improved scientific understanding and increased human capital to address the challenges inherent in understanding the impact of climate change on ground water recharge.  In terms of understanding we have shown that the regions of the West that are currently the driest and already subject to significant groundwater over draft (e.g. the southern Central Valley, the southern Basin and Range and the southern High Plains) are likely to see the largest creases in recharge.  These decreases will exacerbate resource constraints and conflicts in this part of the Western United States.  Our groups results have also shown that simple extrapolation from changes in precipitation are not possible for understanding climate impacts on groundwater recharge.  Changes in temperature and the importance of land surface properties serve an intermediate role that can change the magnitude and direction of recharge processes.  On the human capital side the group of hydrologists and atmospheric scientists involved in this project has developed an improved understanding of how climate and recharge interact.  This knowledge will enable them to better investigate the hydrologic processes governing groundwater recharge response to climate and improve future projections of climate impact.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Meixner"
