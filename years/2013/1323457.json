The general goal for NEMB 2013 is to bring together\r\nleading experts in biology, medicine, nanomaterials, and engineering so as to review experimental methods, synthetic methods, results, models, computations, analyses and innovative methodologies for quantifying and treating medical disorders using engineering approaches. These are emerging areas that are of greatest importance not only for mechanics and materials but also for engineering and science in general, and for the development of new technologies in particular.\r\n\r\nThe combination of engineering and biology with a strong focus in medicine will be a hallmark of the planned event. We will actively involve a large community of participants, and provide an exciting forum to exemplify the intellectual merit of mechanics of materials\r\nin the solution of pressing problems in biology and medicine. Specific research areas to be covered include manufacturing and materials for nanomedicine, biology and nanoengineering, nanotechnology and public health, bioinspired materials and structures, and the application of mechanics principles to detect and treat cancer. Key intellectual questions include multiscale coupling of mechanical systems, linking chemical to continuum mechanical concepts, or the mechanics of adhesion and in the context of nanoparticles for cancer treatment, such as cell uptake. These are emerging areas of mechanics that will receive considerable attention through this event. This award will specifically enable support for student participants, student awards (oral and poster presentations), and networking opportunities for young researchers.",
