 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to develop and apply modern free probability theory (FPT) to advance understanding of applied problems that traditionally are thought to be too difficult to tackle. The difficulty with quantum many-body systems (QMBS) research is two-fold: 1. The spectra of the sum of local interactions is not easily obtained from the spectra of the summands and 2. The exponential growth with the number of particles of the Hilbert space makes exact diagonalization feeble for any serious study of matter.\r\n \r\nThe nature of the work will be both analytical and computational. The techniques are either entirely unknown to natural scientists or that their potential applicability is obscured by formal presentations.  The purpose of this work is to apply an alternative methodology in probability to new physical problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n  This project began as a project in applied free probability and then transitioned to a project on high performance computing.  We will mention highlights of the broad research.\n   Applied free probability is a discipline of random matrix theory which among many applications extends classical signal vs noise theory to the matrix case.  In a paper on \"Infinite Random Matrix Theory,\" we show how four parameters may be used to very flexibly describe and approximate, a very large class of distributions, in \"Beyond Universality.\" we show how to go the next steps on an important problem in the asymptotics of singular values.\n  We now turn to the general development of the Julia computing language which has made a huge impact on science, big data, machine learning, in academia, and industry.  With over 3,000,000 downloads and 2,500 packages, the Julia ecosystem is inspiring new textbooks, new approaches to science, and new technologies.  Still the \"new kid on the block,\" the Julia language is widely acknowledged for having solved the \"two language problem\", textbooks are springing up at major institutions such as Stanford university and UCLA, and interest at supercomputing centers.  This work funded many of the explorations at the MIT Julia Lab and at MIT?s Lincoln Laboratory.\n    One of the major achievements is showing how abstractions are truly important not only in computer science but in computational science as well.
