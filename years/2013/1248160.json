 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will focus on development of novel biopolymers obtained by covalently attaching peptide side chains to hyaluronic acid (HA) backbone polymer chains through carefully controlled chemistry.  The resulting material can be used for soft tissue augmentation, protection, and rejuvenation.  The work will rely on a combined experimental and molecular modeling approach.    In this novel approach, the synthesized polypeptide-HA polymer is an in-situ gelling biomaterial that self-assembles into a physical gel inside the body driven by hydrophobic attractions between the peptide side chains. Molecular modeling will guide the synthesis of polypeptide-HA polymers that form gels with desired mechanical and osmotic properties. The physical crosslinks in the gel can be reversibly broken down by high shear forces in the injection needle, allowing use of a narrow gauge injection needle that reduces patient pain and allows for formation of stiffer, more resilient gels. The innovative biopolymer is likely to outperform currently used biomaterials because of in-situ gelling, better control of and accessibility to a wider range of gel properties and the side chains can be used to carry molecules with biological functionality. \r\n \r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a new material that can meet requirements for an ideal HA-containing dermal filler.  These requirements include a material that is pain-free and easy-to-inject into the body, in vivo survivability for at least one year, absence of immunogenic or allergic reactions, enhanced water retention, tunable mechanical properties, attachment of functional molecules, and low cost. Such a material will significantly enhance capabilities for soft tissue augmentation over existing HA-based materials and will be in large demand.  The properties of the novel biopolymer can be tuned for other important and growing biomedical applications such as viscosupplementation for arthritic joints and ocular antioxidant protection. The proposed combined experimental and molecular modeling approach will also provide a unique fundamental understanding of the interplay between molecular characteristics (composition and architecture) and macroscopic properties (mechanical and transport properties) of gels and solutions comprised of these molecules. The proposed molecular simulation guided material design approach is a state-of-the-art technology that can be extended for development of other complex materials.",

Salt Lake City, UT\n\nHyaluronic acid (HA) polymers were modified by grafting of low molecular polymers (oligomers) of leucine (a hydrophobic peptide), forming PLeu-g-HA block copolymers.  These biopolymers are formed from entirely from materials found naturally in the body and are believed to be highly biocompatible.  The polymers were demonstrated to form gels in aqueous solution due to the aggregation of the hydrophobic PLeu side chains.  Molecular simulations were performed in order to better understand network formation by the biopolymer and to guide optimization of the properties of the gel.  Simulations and rheological characterization of synthesized materials demonstrated that the relationship between the structure of PLeu-g-HA (e.g., the frequency and length of the side chains and HA molecular weight) and the properties of the resulting gel are complex.  A competition between collapse of the polymer chain/phase separation and formation of improved gels was observed with increasing leucine content.  In addition, it was demonstrated that Vitamin A (tretinoin) could be attached to the PLeu, allowing for the synthesis of Vitamin A-PLeu-g-HA polymers.  These polymers have potential application in soft tissue augmentation (e.g, for treating facial disfigurement due to accidents or disease), viscosupplementation for those who suffer from osteoarthritis, treatment of skin ailments, transdermal drug delivery, and cosmetics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Grant Smith"
