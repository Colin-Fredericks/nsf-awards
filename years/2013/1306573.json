 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brownian dynamics (BD) is a computational method for macromolecular simulation with a myriad of applications in multiple areas including biology and chemical engineering.  Currently, many BD simulations ignore the effect of the long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between particles in a fluid.  This choice is made to reduce the computational cost of these simulations, although it is now appreciated that HI is responsible for much of the dynamic behavior of macromolecules that we observe in reality.  This project will develop matrix-free algorithms and software to enable the modeling of hydrodynamic interactions in large-scale BD simulations.\r\n \r\nFurther, although BD has been a staple technique, it is not able to accurately model HI in high volume fraction systems, such as the crowded environment inside biological cells.  A solution is to use Stokesian dynamics (SD).  A drawback of SD is its high computational cost, but this cost can also be reduced for large systems using a matrix-free approach.  New matrix-free free approaches for SD will be developed that are more efficient than those currently available, and that are also applicable to BD.\r\n \r\nThe high computational cost of HI is due to the construction and manipulation of a large hydrodynamic mobility or diffusion matrix.  This project's approach is to replace this mobility matrix by an operator applied with a FFT-based particle-mesh Ewald summation, thereby asymptotically reducing the computational complexity and storage requirements compared to commonly used methods.  Since the mobility matrix is no longer available, this approach requires the use of matrix-free algorithms for computing Brownian displacements.\r\n \r\nThe algorithms will be implemented in a high-performance software library for multicore nodes and GPUs.  The library can be used by other researchers to add fast HI capabilities and also SD functionality to their existing BD codes.  Data analysis tools to handle long and large trajectory output files will also be developed.  The software tools will be demonstrated on large-scale biological simulations to study the mechanisms behind diffusion in the E. coli nucleoid.\r\n \r\nBD simulation is the main tool used in biology for studying intra-cellular transport and the diffusive mechanisms that lie behind almost all cellular processes.  This work will pave the way for other researchers to perform much more realistic BD simulations at large scales.  Furthermore, the algorithms developed here may be applied to a wide range of other particle simulation methods in mechanical and chemical engineering and materials science where Brownian particles interact through long-range forces.  The results of this work will be disseminated to both the application and computational science communities.  Software implementing the new algorithms will be released in library form under an open-source license, and educational materials on particle simulations, accessible to computer science and mathematics students, will be made freely available on the Web.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addressed the development and application of \"Brownian dynamics\" and \"Stokesian dynamics\" methods to simulate the interactions between macromolecules in the interior of biological cells.  The long-range, hydrodynamic interactions can be described by a dense covariance matrix, but very large simulations involving hundreds of thousands of macromolecules imply using very large matrices, making traditional approaches for these large simulations infeasible.  Our approach has been to develop new, efficient methods for simulating hydrodynamic interactions that do not involve explicitly representing or operating on dense matrices.\n\nOur first main outcome is a new method for iteratively generating random samples of Brownian displacements that are correlated according to the covariance matrix.  Although such iterative methods are already known, they cannot be preconditioned to improve their convergence rate, as any such transformations change the problem being solved.  However, we found a way to transform the original problem such that the new problem also generates a properly correlated random vector (although not the same one as the original problem, but this is not necessary).  The transformed problem is much better conditioned, and thus leads to faster convergence and faster overall simulations.\n\nOur second main outcome is a new approximation to dense hydrodynamic covariance matrices that retain the important property of positive definiteness.  These approximations are based on hierarchically decomposing the matrix and exploiting the approximate low-rank structure of its off-diagonal blocks.  However, when replacing off-diagonal blocks by low-rank approximations, the overall approximation may no longer be positive definite.  We developed two new algorithms for constructing such approximation that retain positive definiteness.  These types of approximations could enable large-scale calculations by representing certain types of dense matrices as efficiently as possible, and thus reduce the amount of computation required when computing with them.\n\nOur third main outcome is the application of Brownian and Stokesian dynamics methods to a model biological cell where we investigated the effect that confinement within a cellular membrane may have on intracellular dynamics.  From these simulations, several findings suggest mechanisms that take place in actual living cells. One finding is that model proteins near the membrane tend to diffuse along the membrane; this may give additional time for signal transduction across the membrane to occur. We also observed more strongly correlated motions near the membrane than in the cell's interior, potentially facilitating interactions between proteins there. Finally, we find that deep in the interior of the model cell, the confining effects of the finite size of a cell on the dynamics can be neglected, which helps validate simulations that do not account for the cell wall.\n\nOur fourth main outcome is simulations of proteins and DNA in the nucleoid of a bacterial cell.  Proteins called transcription factors must diffuse through the nucleoid to find their binding sites on DNA.  By constructing a coarse-grained model of DNA with physiologically accurate concentrations, we find that DNA is densely packed, is not rigid but highly mobile, and the dynamics of DNA dictates to a great extent the protein motion.  These simulations suggest that protein motion in the nucleoid can be categorized as gated diffusion, where DNA confines the protein in a cage, but the protein can move between cages when hindering DNA strands move out of the way.  The internal motions of DNA appear to be governed by strong internal forces arising from being crowded into the small space of the nucleoid. Our simulation data also suggest that DNA internal motion help transcription factors find their DNA binding sites faster.\n\nBroader impacts of this project include open source StokesDT software that has been released so that other researchers can perform large-scale Brownian hydrodynamic simulations in their own applications.  The preconditioning transformation that was developed is broadly applicable to any application where sampling Gaussian random vectors is needed.  Similarly, the positive-definiteness preserving matrix approximations are also applicable to many types of dense positive definite matrices.  This project has also mentored Masters students, PhD students, and postdoctoral associates in computational science, preparing them for research careers.  New teaching materials based on this research have also been developed and used in graduate level courses and invited tutorials on high performance computing and scientific computing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edmond Chow"
