 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide an ideal set up for realizing some of the most pristine pseudogap states currently known from theoretical studies. Those states could be fundamentally different from the poorly understood pseudogap state of high-temperature superconductors, while exhibiting a similar phenomenology due to significant quantum fluctuations.  This project focuses on the theoretical investigation of unconventional superfluid and insulating states of ultracold fermions in optical lattices. The idea is to identify and characterize those states in resonantly paired fermions and systematically explore the phase diagram of pair-density-wave and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states in realistic lattice potentials. One of our main goals is to unveil the minimal microscopic ingredients required for the existence of those states so that they can be realized in experiments. The research will mostly rely on the unique combination of numerical methods that the two PIs have advanced in their recent work: exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo simulations (M.R.), and order-parameter-dependent free energy minimization (P.N.).\r\n\r\nThis project will incorporate a broad outreach effort taking advantage of the location of George Mason and Georgetown Universities. Opportunities such as science fairs and public lectures will be used to attract high school and undergraduate students from Northern Virginia to pursue higher education and careers in science and engineering, as well as participate in the funded research projects. This grant will further facilitate the building of advanced research programs in atomic and condensed matter theory at George Mason and Georgetown Universities. Graduate students at both universities will receive training in high performance computing, and will gain experience performing highly parallel calculations in high performance computing centers within the US. We will encourage the participation of members of underrepresented groups in Physics and the results of this research will be reported in the joint conferences of the National Society of Black Physicists and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists.",

It has great potential for technological applications, but remains poorly understood. Ultracold gases in optical lattices have emerged as nearly ideal analog simulators for the simplified, but still too difficult to solve, models used to describe high-temperature superconductors. Challenges, such as the need for very low temperatures, have precluded advances in this direction. Under this award, we introduced and studied a model that realizes an insulator to superconductor transition similar to the one observed in high-temperature superconductors. This model is free of the so called \"sign problem\" and hence can be studied using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By modifying the nature of the superconducting order parameter from d-wave to s-wave, the insulating to superconducting transition (as well as the phases around it) can be observed at temperatures already accessible in experiments. We explored the lowest energy excitations in the insulating phase close to the transition finding that they have a bosonic character, like the one found in the pseudo-gap phase of the cuprates. Hence, this model opens a new route to exploring pseudo-gap physics with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Ultracold gases have also allowed the experimental study of nonequilibrium phenomena in strongly correlated systems. This is something that is also much more challenging in condensed matter setups as, there, extremely fast probes are needed to observe transient behavior. Under this award we studied quantum dynamics in two different setups. The first one was a so-called quantum quench of two noninteracting Fermi seas when a finite interaction strength and suppressed quantum tunneling drive the dynamics. We unveiled and characterized collapse and revival phenomena in the momentum distribution function of the Fermi seas. Similar phenomena has been observed in the past with Bose-Einstein condensates. Our work should motivate the experimental exploration of collapse and revival phenomena in Fermi seas.
