 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sustainable Futures North project addresses the question of whether synergies can be found among the related goals of food security, water security, energy security, and resource development in the North American Arctic. Historically, development in one or more of these areas has presented trade-offs in others; for example, petroleum exploration and development is often associated with negative impacts on traditional subsistence species and practices. Similarly, residents of the Bristol Bay region of Alaska are currently embroiled in a debate over the risks and benefits of developing of a copper and gold mine, which would ostensibly provide jobs and economic development opportunities, at the headwaters of a watershed that supports the world's largest sockeye salmon run. With an eye toward eliciting best practices for community development and resource management that target synergies rather than trade-offs, the research team plans to combine integrated regional assessments of water, food, and energy systems in three regions of the North: Bristol Bay (Alaska), Baffin Island (Canada), and Kotzebue Sound (Alaska), where people and communities share a variety of challenges relating to climate change, socioeconomic change, and industrial development. The research methods that make up the project's interdisciplinary toolkit include key informant interviews, integration and analysis of secondary datasets, climate change downscaling, engineering best practice and gap analysis, and rural-urban network analysis. The research team will link these qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore cause-and-effect relationships between development activities and societal and environmental changes, and will integrate social and ecological datasets with climate change scenarios to project future community responses to climatic and environmental change. The findings of this research will inform a collaborative education and outreach program designed to build capacity through workforce development, STEM internships, and post-secondary curricula and programs in environmental management and engineering.",

Over five years, SFN has advanced the science of food, water, and energy security in the North. SFN also made novel contributions in the area of environmental migration, exploring why people stay or leave during times of rapid change. In total, SFN produced multiple scholarly advances on these areas of research, including 14 peer review publications, 3 academic theses, and 3 report/book chapters, all of which are in highly respected publications.

He toured water systems and performed expert interviews in 13 Alaska villages with imperiled source water and/or failing wastewater systems, and published extensively on the social and engineered dimensions of water insecurity in Alaska. His papers were published in a variety of respected venues, including: Journal of Environmental Management; Weather, Climate, and Society; and Human Ecology. His experience and research also informed the judgment criteria for a State of Alaska competition for innovative rural water systems design. He received an interdisciplinary PhD from UAF in 2015.

Collectively, the six short films have been viewed nearly 30,000 times on Youtube. The films also aired regularly on public television in Alaska from 2016-2019. SFN also produced fact sheets on food security that have been used by policymakers in the US and Canada. Additionally, the podcast <em>Rural Routes </em>produced a feature in collaboration with SFN on northern home engineering in 2016<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Philip%20Loring/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/DXIZGETM/Sustainable%20Futures%20North%20outcomes%20report%20and%20addendum.docx#_ftn3\">[3]</a>.</p>\n<p>Another example of successful outreach is the session on Arctic Science our team held at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
