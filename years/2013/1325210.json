 "awd_abstract_narration": "Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes to support technical services on R/V Pelican, a 116 foot, general purpose research vessel operated by the consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support for basic services only; they will provide one technician on each seagoing research project. In addition, the technical services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget included with this report is for the first year of a 4-year continuing grant.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Pelican had no days for NSF. All other vessels in the Academic Fleet submitted proposals in 2012 for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant. For LUMCON, however, there was no award made in 2012. In order to keep all vessels on the same schedule with regards to the length of the technical services continuing grants, this award is proposed as the first year of a four-year continuing grant.\r\n\r\nThe Program received the proposal on 1/18/2013. As required, the proposal provided information regarding 2012 operations as well as outlining plans and a proposed budget for 2013.  Research vessels in the Academic Fleet provide support for researchers from a variety of federal and state agencies, as well as some private sponsors. All users (or the appropriate funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel equally, via a day-rate, with each paying a share of the costs based on fractional usage of the vessel. The rates are negotiated annually with the NSF Program Manager.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

The R/V <em>Pelican </em>is operated by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as a member of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and receives funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The R/V <em>Pelican </em>was designed and outfitted to conduct a variety of oceanographic research missions such as trawling, sediment sampling using box cores, thirty-foot piston cores, and an 8-core multicore, as well as shallow seismic surveys, measuring ocean currents, collecting continuous weather and sea surface data, water column profiles down to over 10,000ft deep, plankton sampling, and deploying weather buoys and other types of moorings. These operations depend on highly skilled and experienced Technical staff which receives funding in part by this NSF grant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The R/V <em>Pelican</em> completed an average of 187 days at sea per year supporting sea-going science with a total of 1,124 days spent researching the Gulf of Mexico during the period of 2012-2017. The cruises were conducted with a broad diversity of scientific researchers from all across the USA as well as some from other countries. The R/V <em>Pelican</em> is routinely called the &ldquo;Biggest little boat in the fleet&rdquo; because its equipment and instrumentation matches the capabilities of some of the larger vessels in the UNOLS fleet. This is matched by the crew and technical staff&rsquo;s can-do attitude as they say &ldquo;The Peli-Can do dat!&rdquo; in response to the many challenging and innovative requests that are encountered during operations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this six-year period, the R/V <em>Pelican</em> has conducted a number of fascinating cruises the highlights of which include studying the Orca Basin Brine pool which is like a large salt water lake on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico where salinities are 6-7 times greater than the salinities in the rest of the ocean. Also, the R/V <em>Pelican </em>conducts recurring cruises to survey the size of the Gulf of Mexico&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dead Zone&rdquo; of low oxygen that occurs every summer and impacts fisheries all across the Gulf States. Another interesting subject that the R/V <em>Pelican</em> routinely studies are the multitude of nature oil and methane seeps in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, many of which naturally release large quantities of oil and gas throughout the year. These seeps are surprisingly very productive habitats and host to a diversity of fishing and invertebrates whose food web is based on bacteria that feed on oil and gas. These cruises are most interesting when conducted with Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) which have cameras that can transmit real-time imagery to the surface which are shown live on the R/V <em>Pelican</em>&rsquo;s big screen TV in the galley.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to scientific research, the R/V <em>Pelican</em> has been host to many groups of students of a variety of ages from many States across the USA. Students often describe these cruises as some of the most memorable of their lives and energize them for their future careers in marine sciences and oceanography. Experience aboard a research vessel often teaches the students many lessons they would not otherwise receive in the classroom alone. One of the most fulfilling experiences for the R/V <em>Pelican</em>&rsquo;s crew and technical staff is to be able to impart some of their experience and skills to the new generation of scientists through these educational cruises. The R/V <em>Pelican</em> also engages in outreach to the community with open-house events locally in Cocodrie, LA as well as New Orleans, Baton Rouge, along with plans for more locations in the
