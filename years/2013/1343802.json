 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grand challenges of geoscience require working across traditional disciplinary\r\nboundaries. Scientists are being called upon to find, access, and use diverse and voluminous\r\ndata types that are described with semantics. The BCube project has put together a strong\r\nteam of geoscientists, cyberinfrastructure experts and social scientists to address these\r\ninteroperability challenges using a maturing Brokering Framework for discovery, access, semantics,\r\nweb crawling, workflows and enhanced user services. The first three have been explored for\r\ngeoscience and are mature enough to provide near term engagement of geoscientists in a test\r\nbed environment. Crawling, workflow and services will be developed during the project. The\r\ngeoscientists, (including early career scientists) from the domains of hydrology, oceans, polar, \r\nweather, will compile community needs and assess broker capabilities in an increasing complex series of user scenarios.\r\nTo address the cultural barriers, BCube includes social science and education in the project team. BCube engages five major\r\nrepositories (DataOne, OOI, USGS, NCAR/RAL, NSIDC) to test and demonstrate interconnections\r\nwith the Broker Framework, with extension to international repositories in the second year.\r\n\r\nThe broker discovery and access modules have two important and unique characteristics: a design\r\nthat builds interoperability without putting a burden upon either users or providers and an\r\ninterfaced web crawling capability to find new data, models and services. New capabilities\r\nalso come as the Broker translates cyberinfrastructure research in areas such as semantics\r\nand workflow into a user-oriented capability for cross-discipline geoscience research. An\r\nagile development process will support rapid adaptations to changing user needs. Since not\r\nall needs can be anticipated, the Broker will also have APIs for scientists to write modules\r\nfor their own applications. BCube will look at the cultural issues in cross-discipline research\r\nto improve acceptance and use of the broker. Both the technical and cultural broker attributes\r\nwill be exercised through user scenarios that start with individual geoscience research issues\r\nand move to more complex cross-discipline research studies. This will develop reference cases\r\nfor metrics, monitoring and validating progress as the Broker Framework evolves and matures.\r\n\r\nTo address the grand challenges facing society, geoscientists need a sustainable and evolvable\r\ncyberinfrastructure supporting cross-discipline research with powerful interoperability. Success\r\nin addressing the project?s six diverse domains will demonstrate this and engender advancements\r\nin the broader geosciences. The Broker module for web 2.0 will support use of crowd sourcing\r\nand citizen science. BCube?s education analyses and early career scientists will consider\r\nthe best way to reach a new generation. Expansion to international data access will be demonstrated\r\nthrough collaboration with the BCube?s international repository partners and a special interest\r\ngroup of the international Research Data Alliance.",
