 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine emerging patterns of economic migration that leave populations trapped in liminal settlement between their sending communities and desired destinations for undefined periods of time. The project will center on ethnographic engagement with the rapidly expanding population of migrants in North Africa. Through a focus on migrants' lived experiences, migrant-citizen interactions in the public sphere of labor and the placement of \"illegal\" subjects within national discourse, the researcher will examine interconnections between new forms of transnational migration, identity construction and social stratification. The research will be conducted in a heavily migrant-populated suburb of a capital city. The researcher will employ a range of qualitative methodologies, including: biographical questionnaires, semi-structured interviewing, \"go-along\" interviewing, oral history collection and ongoing participant observation as a volunteer caseworker at a migrant aid organization. \r\n\r\nThe project will advance anthropological understandings of citizenship and \"illegality\" by exploring the racial, social and economic constructions of political identity. Findings from this research will be important to scholars and policymakers, who examine North Africa as a final stopping point for African migrants. In addition to training a graduate student, funding this project will contribute valuable information to those working towards policy reform to ensure that international human rights conventions are upheld throughout the E.U. and its periphery.",
