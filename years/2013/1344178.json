 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is co-funded by the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research and the Software and Hardware Foundations Program of the Division of Computing and Communications Foundations, with additional contributions from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\n\r\n\tThe aim of this project is to lay the foundations for new research directions in \"materials that compute\".  To achieve this goal the work will focus on developing integrated sensing, computing and responsive systems by using non-linear oscillating chemical reactions to perform spatio-temporal processing and recognition tasks. The specific materials that will be considered for these tasks are polymer gels undergoing the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction; these materials are flexible and stimuli-responsive and encompass distinct oscillating domains. The temporal coherence of the BZ reactions in these gels will be harnessed to perform associative processing between sets of stored or learned patterns and input stimuli in the form of patterns of light, pressure, or chemistry. The effective resonance between the input patterns and the oscillators will be used as the basic computation paradigm. In effect, the aim of the studies will be to \"let the physics do the computing\". Hence, the research will enable the design of systems where the behavior of dynamic attractors will make possible rapid convergence to the solution. Consequently, these materials systems will respond to their environment in programmable ways. The development of these new materials systems -- which are capable of autonomously sensing, communicating, and responding to environmental changes -- will provide an opportunity for new interactions between the materials and computer science communities. \r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\n\r\n\tThe overarching goal of this work is to transform computing platforms away from desktops or even hand-held mobile appliances fabricated from a large collection of heterogeneous parts to a computational \"fabric\" built with new material systems and implementing new computational paradigms. The ideal computing material would be lightweight and mechanically compliant, and would sense and respond to human touch and motion in order to perform a level of computing that will enrich the lives of its users. Furthermore, the material would perform these \"sense, compute and respond\" functions in a relatively autonomous manner, enabling it to operate without connections to an external power supply. This work seeks to achieve these objectives by investigating the co-evolution of energy-transducing, soft materials, such as oscillating chemical gels, and modes of computation, such as non-Boolean associative processing, which can exploit these materials characteristics. The impact of this work will be to nucleate a new field of \"materials that compute\"; that is, systems where the computer and the material are one and the same entity. The ability to create smart materials that can sense the environment, process information and react to complex stimuli should enable new systems that will interface with humans to provide tactile, temperature, and photonic inputs to smart clothing, robotic manipulators and possibly prosthetic limbs.",
