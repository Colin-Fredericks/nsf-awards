By presenting and discussion problems \r\nas well as  recent advances in these areas we hope to  facilitate further interactions.\r\n\r\nAnother goal of the workshop is to provide an informal setting where graduate students and younger researchers from  US \r\ncan learn about new trends and interact with one another as well as with prominent senior\r\nmathematicians.  There will be three tutorials on recent developments\r\nin Model Theory given by experts and aimed mostly at young researchers. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is expecting participation from a large number of\r\ngraduate student and recent Ph.D.s.\r\nBesides providing an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas and discuss open problems, another\r\nequally important goal of the workshop is to foster interaction among\r\ngraduate students and recent Ph.D  by providing a setting\r\ncontacts with junior and senior researchers are naturally and easily made.\r\n\r\nMore information about the workshop can be found on its webpage\r\nhttp://logica.dmi.unisa.it/Ravello/",
