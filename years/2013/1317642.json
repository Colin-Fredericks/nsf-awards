 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STEP project is engaged in scaling up successful pilot programs in the University of California at Riverside's College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The Program is known as Student Learning Communities and Research Engagement (SL-CARE).  The STEP project consists of three early interventions: 1) first-year learning communities, 2) first-year laboratory research experiences, and 3) a second-year career exploration and mentoring program. This award is building on 5-year pilots of 1 and 2.  Data from the piloted learning communities indicates that this intervention has very high potential for improving retention and graduation of undergraduate students.  Hence, learning communities are the main thrust of this STEP project. They are being expanded to include 80 percent of incoming first-year undergraduates in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, thereby doubling participation from 500 to 1,000 students. The second intervention dimension is focused on expanding another successful pilot program to transform traditional introductory laboratories to discovery-based research laboratories. A third intervention component is a new one, focused on guiding STEM majors in their second year of study into exploring possible STEM careers, with active participation by peer, alumni, and professional STEM mentors. Overall, the goal of this STEP project is to improve graduation rates of STEM majors from 24% to more than 50% in 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe University of California Riverside is the most ethnically-diverse campus in the University of California system, and is consistently ranked in the top ten most diverse Tier 1 research universities in the United States according to the 2011 edition of US News and World Report on Colleges.  The majority of the students in this project are from non-white families.  The undergraduate ethnicity of the University's students in 2011 was 40% Asian & Asian American, 29% Chicano and Latino, 17% White, 8% African American, 2% International, and 4% unknown. This context clearly informs the project's potential to exercise broader impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreasing the number and diversity of students graduating with STEM degrees is of national importance, as creative problem solving requires a well-educated workforce in the sciences and technology.  To that end, the goal of this project was to increase success outcomes at UCR for students majoring in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences (CNAS).  The approach taken was to expand a first year academic learning community model, a goal that was achieved by the end of the project with 70% of incoming freshmen accommodated in the learning communities, despite large increases in students enrolling in the college over the time period.  \n\n \n\nThe Freshmen Scholars Learning Communities (LC) were designed to encompass a constellation of activities in an effort to meet the needs of UCR\u2019s highly diverse student body.  The Learning Community program is structured such that incoming students are placed in cohorts of 24, and co-enrolled in the lecture, lab and discussion sections for two math and/or science classes each quarter for their first year.  The most difficult course each quarter employed a supplemental instructor to provide additional tutoring.  Each fall, the students also enroll in a course with weekly meetings with both faculty and academic advisors.  The curriculum led by the academic advisors helps students learn to navigate the university, discover resources, and plan their academic path.  The faculty directed portion of the course complements the advisor-led content, and frequently integrates research and scientific career related activities over the course. Participating faculty are encouraged to develop mentoring connections with their students.  Students in the program also have access to upper classmen employed as peer mentors.  Thus, the program encourages students to develop connections with each other, with more senior students in their majors, with academic advisors, and with faculty. In addition to the research exposure that may come from the faculty seminar, students in the LC have additional opportunities for research experiences.  First, LC students can opt to enroll in lab course sections that provide more authentic research experiences than the traditional lab course, such as the Dynamic Genome course that is an alternate to the Introductory Biology lab.  Second, those completing the program can apply for positions in the CNAS RISE summer research program, which provides a stipend for 10-week engagement in faculty mentored research and professional development.  Finally, as sophomores, the students can engage in a full day science career exposure and alumni networking program. \n\n \n\nSeveral outcomes were measured in order to gauge the effectiveness of the program interventions.  Importantly, the project achieved its goals, tripling the number of learning community participants over the time period.  Key outcomes for participants such as four year and six graduation rates, retention, as well as the sense of belonging in CNAS, improved among LC participants.  While the impact of the programming was positive for all subgroups, it showed lesser impact upon first generation students.  Notably, regression analyses suggested that early research exposure is an important determinant of student success, independent of other variables.  \n\n \n\nDeveloping data-informed best practices to improve retention and graduation rates of students in science majors is critically important for universities.  Analysis of this project is contributing to the shared literature on first year student experience programs. Because UCR is a highly diverse research institution, large numbers of students from a variety of demographics participated, allowing more robust statistical analyses across subgroups, widening the impact of the study. Overall, the practices and data developed from this project provide important guides to inform future efforts to improve student success outcomes at UCR as well as at other institutions. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Constance I Nugent"
