ILAR seeks to identify practices that provide for excellence in the welfare of animals used for these purposes, recognizing their moral value while achieving high-quality science. ILAR also evaluates and encourages the use, development, and validation of non-animal alternatives. By engaging the expertise residing in the laboratory animal science, veterinary, and broader biological research communities, ILAR formulates and disseminates guidelines and standards for humane and scientifically sound animal care and use and provides independent and objective advice on developments and key research opportunities in laboratory animal science and medicine to the U.S. federal government, the international biological research community, and the public.
