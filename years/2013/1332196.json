 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to investigate projects in three areas, related by the theme of the complex Monge-Ampere equation.  The first project will build on the PI's work with Tosatti which gave an analogue of Yau's Theorem for compact Hermitian manifolds.  The PI proposes to generalize these estimates and apply them to obtain new results on the Bott-Chern space of a complex manifold.  The second project deals with the Kahler-Ricci flow - which can be regarded as the parabolic complex Monge-Ampere equation - on algebraic varieties.  As part of a program to understand the analytic minimal model program, the PI and Song investigated the Kahler-Ricci flow on algebraic varieties and gave necessary conditions under which the flow contracts an exceptional divisor.  The PI proposes to extend these results to deal with more general singularities and also to study the behavior of the curvature tensor along the Kahler-Ricci flow.  The final project concerns the Calabi-Yau equation on symplectic manifolds.  Donaldson conjectured that the complex Monge-Ampere equation solved by Yau has an analogue for symplectic 4-manifolds with compatible almost complex structures.\r\nHe gave applications of his conjecture to symplectic topology. Special cases of Donaldson's conjecture were established by the PI and his co-authors.  The PI will undertake an analysis of the structure of the blow-up set for the Calabi-Yau equation, with the ultimate goal of proving Donaldson's conjecture.\r\n\r\nAn important problem in mathematics, and physics, is to understand the interaction between geometry and differential equations.  This proposal concerns a well-known and centuries-old mathematical object called the Monge-Ampere equation.  This equation arises naturally in the study of geometry and is closely related to Einstein's equations in physics.  A main goal of this project is to find applications of the Monge-Ampere equation to more general and commonly occuring geometric objects where it was not previously known that a connection exists.  By finding new relationships between this classical differential equation and geometry, the PI aims to further our understanding of what kind of geometric structures can exist.  In addition, the Monge-Ampere equation is deeply related to geometry via an associated heat flow.  It is expected that this heat flow will help us understand some old and difficult problems concerning solutions to algebraic equations.  Indeed, the solutions of algebraic equations define geometric objects, and the heat flow deforms these objects and can extract information from them.  The PI will investigate the precise behavior of the Monge-Ampere heat flow on such geometric objects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe laws of physics are written in the language of differential equations. These are equations involving rates of change of quantities relative to space or time.  This project investigated a particular equation known as the Monge-Ampere equation.  This equation is connected to many physical problems and has a rich mathematical theory.  Historically, it arose in the study of optimal transport: how to move collections of objects from one place to another in the most efficient way.  More recently, the Monge-Ampere equation has played a key role in the modern theory of particle physics known as String Theory.  Indeed, one of the central equations of space-time in this physical theory can be solved using a Monge-Ampere equation in the setting of what is known as complex geometry.\n\nA geometric space is called complex if it has a special structure (called a complex structure) which generalizes the notion of a rotation through 90 degrees.  These structures are plentiful - they always exist on two-dimensional spaces, for example &ndash; and they give rise to a rich and fairly rigid mathematical theory.\n\nThis project concerns the Monge-Ampere equation on complex geometric spaces.  Yau solved this equation on complex geometric spaces known as Kahler manifolds, and this is precisely the setting that arises in the basic models of string theory.  Moreover, Yau\u00c6s results had many applications to the study of geometry and algebra.  A major outcome of this project is to extend and generalize Yau\u00c6s results.  In a joint work with Valentino Tosatti, the PI showed the existence of solutions to a family of Monge-Ampere type equations on general complex spaces (not necessarily Kahler).  There are possible applications to the study of algebraic spaces (those arising as solutions to algebraic equations) and there is also a connection to a physical theory known as the Strominger system.\n\nAnother major outcome of this project is in the understanding of parabolic Monge-Ampere equations: these are equations where there is, in addition, a dependence on time.  A major problem in mathematics is to classify all possible geometries, within some constraints.  Hamilton and Perelman showed that a parabolic flow, called the Ricci flow, could be used to classify all possible geometries on closed three-dimensional spaces.  The Ricci flow is a kind of heat flow for geometric spaces, and it works by deforming the space to find the \"best\" geometry. The PI, together with his collaborators Tosatti and Yang, studied the Ricci flow on complex spaces.  It turns out that this flow is precisely an equation of parabolic Monge-Ampere type.  A major success of this project was to understand how, under the Ricci flow, Kahler spaces carry out a transition known as a collapse.  This is when the dimension of the space jumps down in a limiting process.  The PI and his collaborators proved new results showing the precise behavior of this geometric collapsing.\n\nThe PI and Tosatti also investigated a relatively new parabolic flow called the Chern-Ricci flow.  This flow is analogous, but different from, the Ricci flow.   It makes sense on general, non-Kahler, complex spaces.  It is also a flow of parabolic Monge-Ampere type.  The PI and his collaborators proved new results showing how this flow deforms complex spaces to reveal their natural geometric structures. \n\nIn terms of broader impact of this project:  the PI was active in the education and training of graduate students and junior mathematicians.  The PI gave a summer mini-course on the Ricci flow on Kahler spaces at the Park City Mathematical Institute in the summer of 2013.  The PI is mentoring a graduate student at Northwestern University.  In addition, he organizes learning seminars for students and postdoctoral scholars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Weinkove"
