 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is part of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime, characteristic cross-lake fetch and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this sub-group will focus on \"short-fetch\" events in which prevailing low-level winds are oriented at large angles relative to Lake Ontario's long axis.  These investigators will seek to advance process-oriented understanding of atmospheric boundary-layer circulations over adjacent complex land cover, factors controlling the location and downwind persistence/spatial extent of lake-effect circulations and associated bands of heavy snowfall, as well as those precipitation events associated with smaller bodies of water as are found in the Finger Lakes region.  Observational assets to be deployed during OWLeS will include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other surface measurement systems.  The intellectual merit of this sub-group's activities is centered upon determination of (1) how upwind land-surface and atmospheric factors determine the three-dimensional structure of the short-fetch convective LeS PBL that develop over a relatively-warm, open water surface; (2) how organized, initially convective cloud and precipitation structures under short-fetch conditions persist far downstream over land, long after leaving the buoyancy source (i.e., the ice-free waters of Lake Ontario); and (3) factors controlling the development of, and interactions between, complex atmospheric stratifications embodying a internal planetary boundary layer and residual layers resulting from airmass advection over multiple mesoscale bodies of water and intervening land.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of OWLeS will include improved physical understanding and model-based representations of conditions that impact populations and associated major transportation corridors along the shores of the Great Lakes region, as well as extensive opportunities for enhanced classroom and hands-on field project based educational opportunities for a large number of students who will be actively engaged in field campaign planning, instrument preparation, data collection and analysis.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntense Lake-effect Snowstorms result when cold air blows across the Great Lakes.  While these storms most frequently impact communities directly on the shore of the Great Lakes, they can also drop significant amounts of snow well over 100 miles inland.  This project focused on discovering how to forecast which Lake-effect Snowstorms will have these inland impacts and how far inland they will extend.  Numerous storms from the winter of 2013/14 were observed by the OWLeS team using weather satellites, Doppler weather radar, instrumented aircraft, weather balloons and a variety of other sensors.  The same storms were also studied using one of the high-resolution numerical models used by operational weather forecasters.  The combination of observations and model results revealed that significant Lake-effect snowfalls extended far inland of the lake shore only during those periods when winds from the north or west were bringing in colder air.  Once the coldest air arrives, heavy snow is confined to the immediate vicinity of the shore. Thus, significant inland snowfall from Lake-effect Snowstorms starts with the passage of a cold front and lasts until the coldest air arrives.  After that, inland snowfall is limited to flurries, although heavy snow continues near the shore.  Rules to predict the inland extend of heavy snow from the rate at which cold air is blowing into a region were developed and shared with the National Weather Service and other operational weather forecasters.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George Young"
