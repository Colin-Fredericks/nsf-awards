The ACM-BCB is expected to be a premier forum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The conference will host three keynote sessions, research sessions, session-specific invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, panel discussion, and poster sessions.  Special activities such as a doctoral consortium and student poster session will be specifically targeted for the students. The ACM-BCB conference has been successful in building a bioinformatics and computational biology community through the newly established ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SIGBioinformatics). The proposed grant will broaden the participation graduate students and help develop the next generation of researchers and educators in the computer science, biological science, biomedical science and other related areas.",
