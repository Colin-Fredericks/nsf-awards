 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this EAGER project is to investigate a new and potentially general approach of using light to alter the properties of various photoresponsive polymers. This approach is based on photo-induced proton transfer. The photo-induced proton transfer will be realized using novel photoacids recently developed by the PI. He will attempt to demonstrate polymers that reversibly alter their mechanical, geometrical, electronic, optical, and/or magnetic properties, and release functional molecules upon photo-irradiation.\r\n\r\nPhoto-induced proton transfer in polymers can alter electronic structures, induce ionic interactions, catalyze chemical reactions, and thus alter the properties of the resulting materials. The proposed project utilizes a new type of photoacid that works as as a bridge between photon and proton so that many polymer properties can be controlled with light. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will attempt to provide a general approach to develop various polymers that respond to light in a variety of different ways. If successful, the resulting polymers could have useful mechanical, electronic, optical and biomedical properties. Therefore, successful implementation of this project could have a broader impact in both scientific and industrial communities.  Graduate students involved in this project will receive interdisciplinary training in polymer science, photochemistry, and materials science.",

In this project, photo-induced proton transfer is investigated as a general approach toward a variety of photoresponsive materials. A novel type of molecule, metastable-state photoacid, was developed to convert a input of light to an output of a proton, which can protonate polymers. Our research showed that protonation can affect the electron structure of a polymer as well as interactions between the polymers. Combining the metastable-state photoacids with some well-designed polymers, materials that reversibly alter their mechanical, electric, and optic properties upon irradiation have been developed. Materials that can kill bacteria and controllably release fragrance under visible light have also been demonstrated. Eleven research articles have been published.
