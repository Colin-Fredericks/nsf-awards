 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop tunable terahertz metamaterials to create a new class of compact electromagnetic devices for rapid real-time sensing and detection. This will be accomplished though integration of micro-capacitive actuators with broadside coupled split ring resonators enabling mechanical tuning of the interlayer coupling and associated electromagnetic response.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is that it provides a novel approach to realize active and dynamic metamaterials. Strongly coupled metamaterial resonators provide a unique and, as yet unrealized, route to create tunable and adaptive electromagnetic composites. The transformative aspect of this project is the implementation of lateral displacement of coupled resonators using microelectromechanical systems technology. Fundamental interactions between split ring resonators in the strong coupling limit will be investigated as a function of lateral and interlayer spacing. This will enable optimization of the precision voltage-controlled response such that new metamaterial designs and fabrication methodologies can be used to implement real-time frequency tuning from terahertz to mid-infrared wavelengths. The chemical sensing capability of such metamaterials will be investigated given theoretical indications of enhanced sensitivity and selectivity afforded by the mechanically tuning.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research includes interdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, fostering development at the boundaries of research disciplines where exciting scientific and technological advances occur. Further, this project will serve as an excellent vehicle to recruit and women and minority scientists, and lead to the development of contemporary courses spanning from biology to physics, photonics, and engineering.",
