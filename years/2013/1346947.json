 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instrumental climate records indicate that drought patterns in western North America are sensitive to Pacific Ocean variability and to interactions between the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, and the North American monsoon. A deeper understanding of the past behavior of these modes is needed to improve predictions of future drought and pluvial cycles. This proposed research would: 1) provide proof of concept for the use of delta-Deuterium records in lake systems where single phase carbonates are not available for delta-18 Oxygen analyses and 2) add to a growing a network of quantitative paleoclimate data sets that would add a critical spatial and temporal perspective to our understanding of aridity patterns in western North America and associated synoptic climate teleconnections.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop lake sediment organic matter del-D records from two closed-basin lakes at centennial scale from two drought-sensitive lakes in the western US for the last 2,000 years. The first, Castor Lake, is a well-studied system in Washington State that has been instrumented for a decade with lake level sensors, water temperature loggers, sediment traps, a weather station, and annual ground, lake and stream sampling for water chemistry and stable isotopes. A decadal scale record of oxygen isotopes has been published from Castor Lake, and offers an opportunity for comparison with Algal del-D. The second lake, Graham Lake, is also a drought-sensitive system located in New Mexico, a region of great interest for drought studies. The team has visited this system, verified that it meets the criteria for their proposed work and plans to recover a series of overlapping cores for this study.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are that if this new del-D technique is successful in these lakes without single phase carbonates, the resulting network of paleodrought datasets from the western US would provide important new information on the timing, duration and magnitude of wet/dry cycles and combined with ongoing research, identify spatial patterns of aridity in North America during late Holocene.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInstrumental climate records indicate that drought patterns in western North America are sensitive to Pacific Ocean variability and to interactions between ENSO, the NAM, and the North American monsoon.  A deeper understanding of the past behavior of these modes is therefore needed to improve predictions of future drought and pluvial cycles.  In the past we have needed isotope records from two lakes with contrasting hydrology to produce a record of drought history.  This is because we have been limited to making stable isotopes measurements on calcium carbonate precipitated from the lake\u00c6s water column.  This has required that we compare the isotopic record from a lake that is hydrologically-open and has a short residence-time to an isotope record from a lake that is hydrologically-closed, has a long residence-time, and is heavily impacted by evaporation and by implication the isotopic enrichment of oxygen-18 and deuterium.  The goal of this project was to measure the deuterium composition on leaf waxes that are archived in lake sediments, but which originally came from terrestrial sources as a means of obtaining the isotopic composition of precipitation and to compare this with organic matter grown in the lake and thus representing the isotopic composition of the lake water after evaporation.  Castor Lake, Washington was selected as one of the sites because of the wealth of published data on this drought sensitive lake including a detailed and well-dated isotope record from precipitated calcium carbonate.  A second lake, Fish Lake, Utah, located in the drought sensitive Southwestern US was also selected for this study.\n\n \n\nTotal lipids were extracted from freeze dried sediments from Castor Lake and Fish Lake with a Dionex ASE-350 using 9:1 dichloromethane:methanol solvent.  The aliphatic fraction was then separated from the total lipid extracts with a silica gel column by elution with 4 ml of hexane.  The identification of highly branched isoprenoids (HBI\u00c6s) and n-alkanes was performed using gas chromatography.  Saturated compounds were isolated from the aliphatic fraction using silver-impregnated silica column chromatography.  We targeted mid (e.g. C21, C23) and long-chain (e.g. C27, C29, C31) n-alkanes, which are derived from algal lipids and terrestrial leaf waxes, respectively.  The abundance and concentrations of these compounds were confirmed and evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\n \n\nExciting new results from Castor Lake indicate the presence of highly branched isoprenoids (HBI\u00c6s) in the sediments.  We focused on the isotopic composition of HBI\u00c6s and terrestrial leaf waxes (long chain n-alkanes) preserved in the sediments to reconstruct the isotopic composition of both the initial precipitation and the lake water as modified by evaporation.  Preliminary results indicate that 1) changes in leaf wax dH reflect synoptic scale precipitation patterns and 2) the relative difference between dH of leaf waxes and HBI\u00c6s capture changes in evaporative stress through time.\n\n \n\nWe targeted sediments contained in Fish Lake, a large tectonic basin resting on the Fish Lake plateau, south central Utah to capture a long record of drought in the desert Southwest.  In this study, we targeted mid (e.g. C21, C23) and long-chain (e.g. C27, C29, C31) n-alkanes, which are derived from algal lipids and terrestrial leaf waxes, respectively.  The abundance and concentrations of these compounds were confirmed and evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Total ion chromatographs confirm that both mid and long chain n-alkanes are present and in high abundance through the Holocene.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark B Abbott"
