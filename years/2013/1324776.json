 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to begin the exploration of the feasibility, phase-transition conditions and growth mechanism of a new allotrope of carbon diamond nanowires.  Through this exploration, the team will try to establish an understanding of the basic science underlying and a synthetic process for reproducible growth of diamond nanowires.  The objective will be met through iterative cycles of synthesis, materials characterization, and device effect demonstration.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is in proving the existence and feasibility of synthesizing a new form of carbon - diamond nanowires, in understanding their synthesis that apparently could take place so-far only at an extraordinarily low temperature and pressure, both of which being greatly lower than the corresponding conditions known as required for the diamond-graphite phase-transitions. Successful completion of this Early-Concept study could help door to further advances in the broad carbon-electronic revolution exemplified by C60, carbon nanotube, and graphene, only this time on the diamond (SP3-bond) side of the family. It could help enrich the classical phase-transition theory with the effects of nano-scale capillary pressure and the surface charges in the nano-regime. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research project are expected in two primary areas; 1) The advancement of fundamental science in the nano-scale regime of the diamond-graphite phase-transitions, 2) international collaboration between USA, Korea, Australia, and Domenico Republic, with many students participating and contributing to the common goal of bringing to existence of yet another new form of carbon nanostructures diamond nanowires.",

The project was exploratory in nature and high-risk.  The growth mechanisms of the diamond and graphite nanowires were not understood at all at the start, which now are better understood.  It is expected that this exploration will eventually lead to advances that may expand the frontier of carbon electronics, by introducing new members to the amazingly versatile Carbon family as did the discoveries for C60, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. The studies have also impacted on various institutional resources via collaborations between researchers in other institutions and internationals. Such institutions include AFRL, Seoul National University in Korea, and IEMN in France. Those collaborations are expected to continue ..."
