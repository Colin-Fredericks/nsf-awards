The budget will be used to support US student  (undergraduate and graduate) participants and presenters. The conference will bring  together researchers and educators focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space, electronic, magnetic, sensor, and photonic devices and systems. The requested support will be used to provide partial travel stipends for student participants at the conference, specifically student presenters in an organized session in the form of registration fees.",
