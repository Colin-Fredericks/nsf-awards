Some of the budget will also be used to partially support meeting registrations for the six of the youngest invited speakers. The meeting will take place in San Francisco from April 3 to 5, 2013. It is the first in its series at the MRS and  is designed to foster the emerging field of 2D-layered materials, focusing on materials different from graphene such as BN, MoS2, WS2, MoO3, BC2N, MoSe2, WSe2. The program includes invited presentations by active, international experts in the field as well as regular contributions, to enable dissemination of the current ideas and to foster critical discussion on the diverse applications.",
