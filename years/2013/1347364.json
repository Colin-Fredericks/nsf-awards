 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main impediment to a wide adoption of outsourcing storage and computing  services is the need to keep the client's data private. Clients may directly own the data, or it can belong to  third parties such as customers of  the client in which case there may be a contractual or legal obligation to keep this data private. The data may be outsourced to external services due to it enormity or due to the complexity of the computations to be performed on the data. This project investigates how to design secure and private database services so they can be integrated  within a larger design of secure systems. The broad impact of this work is new methods to ensure the private manipulations of large data sets in an efficient and easy to integrate manner, which is of vital importance to enable utilization of cloud services. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigators study mechanisms that allow one to privately outsource large amounts of data to the cloud and privately execute various computations over this data. The data may change over time which will require the design of efficient methods to update the data while maintaining its privacy which do not increase dramatically with the size of the database. The project focuses on the composability of the security guarantees provided, so as to ensure that the overall privacy and security guarantees of a service can be deduced from the properties of its components.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVerSum\n\nVerSum allows lightweight clients to outsource expensive computationsover large and frequently changing data structures, such as the Bitcoin or Namecoin blockchains, or a Certificate Transparency log.  VerSum clients ensure that the output is correct by comparing the outputs from multiple servers.  The assumption is that at least one server is honest, and crucially, when servers disagree, VerSum uses an efficient conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a mistake and thus obtain the correct output.\n\n\nVerSum's contribution lies in achieving low server-side overhead for both\nincremental re-computation and conflict resolution,  Experimental results\nwith an implementation of VerSum show that VerSum can be used for a\nvariety of computations, that it can support many clients, and that it\ncan easily keep up with Bitcoin's rate of new blocks with transactions.\n\nCryptanalysis of Multiple Correlated Inatnces\n\nInstances of computational problems often do not exist in isolation. Rather, multiple and correlated instances of the same problem arise naturally in the real world. For example, in coding theory, the objective is to recover from as many possible errors as possible: to this end, one may well take advantage of the fact that a typical hard-drive contains error-correcting encodings of multiple files that are within small edit-distance from each other.\n\nWe  showed that access to multiple instances of one-way functions based solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), whose solutions are correlated via a natural generating process, radically changes the complexity of inverting the one-way functions, from intractable to expected polynomial time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shafrira Goldwasser"
