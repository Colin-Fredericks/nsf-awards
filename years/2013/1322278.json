 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how activity-trace information can be used to enhance social transparency in online peer-production communities, in order to support learning and knowledge sharing. Specifically, we examine whether capturing and broadcasting the actions that individuals take on electronic artifacts can support process learning about how to do a task. We conduct a series of design experiments to explore how peer access to various types of activity-trace data affects knowledge sharing.  Our goal is to identify how transparent environments can be designed to capture knowledge as a side effect of peer production activity. \r\n \r\nSocial technology is radically changing the nature of work. Organizations now recognize the value of social technology for increasing access to a broad range of participants but struggle with how to incorporate this technology into work environments. This project examines how \"social transparency\" -- visibility of others' actions on shared artifacts -- can be used to improve coordination and knowledge sharing in virtual organizations. Results will inform the design of online work environments that support professional skill development alongside collaborative peer-production activities. The project will also inform educational technology design and policy, by analyzing, predicting and explaining learning in an online community. To enhance the project's broader impact, the research team will foster dialogue with the technical community entrusted with designing online peer-production environments, to ensure that these systems support effective learning and knowledge exchange.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nOnline product communities are becoming a primary engine of economic value creation for all manner of digital artifacts.  These communities cut across organizational, expertise, cultural, and other boundaries, and function at a scale that is not commonly studied in computer-supported cooperative work.  In this project we generated empirical results, design principles, and tool prototypes that will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these communities. \nOur specific objectives for this project were to (1) complete a multi-method study of the way social information and detailed activity traces impact key decisions in a transparent development environment, (2) conduct studies of how activity traces and identity visibility impact how work is done in online environments, and (3) develop and begin deployment of the Scientific Software Network Map.  \nWe have several important results from our multi-method study of the use of social information and activity traces in a transparent development environment.  We found that for decisions about use and contribution, developers made inferences about (1) project dynamics, (2) personal utility, and (3) community evaluation.  While these three types of inferences were present in both types of decisions, the factors the developers looked at and the attributes they were inferring differed.  In our study of the acceptance of code contributions in GitHub, we found that activity traces reflective both of social and technical factors were powerful and significant predictors whether a given request would be accepted.  The number of comments on a contribution was a very powerful predictor that the request would be rejected, unless there was a prior social connection between the requester and the community, in which case the number of comments had little effect.  The work shows the substantial promise of activity traces to unravel the complex social and technical workings of socio-technical ecosystems.  \n\n \nOur work in transparent development environments is a major advance in understanding how workers in such information-rich environments make sense of the information available and use it to make key decisions.
