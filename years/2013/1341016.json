The workshop would be held preceding the October, 2013 meeting of ASTC in Albuquerque, NM.  \r\n\r\nThere has been little research performed on the unique components of STEM giant screen films related to the role of immersion, presence, and effect on cognition.  This workshop would begin with an online forum where invited participants would develop a list of questions, organize prior research, and identify relevant readings.  During the workshop day at ASTC, participants would engage in roundtable exercises to develop the research program strategies (methods, collaborative communities, etc.) for the prioritized questions.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop outcomes include development of future research proposals and collaborative communities that will address the questions related to the impact of giant screen films and the role of immersion and presence on learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe workshop, Setting the Agenda for Giant Screen Research Workshop was held October 18, 2013, in Albuquerque, NM.  The goal of the Workshop was to begin to redress the lack of giant screen (GS) research by generating a research agenda and the community infrastructure needed to develop and implement long-term research efforts; and serving as a platform to engage and stimulate action towards GS research.  Invited participant thought leaders included GS filmmakers, marketers, exhibitors and distributors; immersive practitioners, and academic researchers.  In a series of three breakout discussions, participants were asked to identify key research issues, define potential research questions and develop a list of constraints and barriers in promoting a research agenda. \n\n Intellectual Merit: Outcomes\n\nThe proposal stated that the intellectual merit of this workshop would lie in its advancing knowledge through the implementation of a long-term research program on the impact of GS films, and the creation of a community of collaborative and diverse group of researchers.  In the three breakouts, participants developed a list of the broad areas and topics that should be used to drive GS research.  Participants commented that any research agenda should consider who this research is for (e.g., filmmakers, distributors, theaters, exhibitors, funders), what research can be most easily undertaken (what do we really want to do), and ensure the sharing of data and evidence among GS stakeholders.  Results pointed to five main categories of interest for a research agenda: audiences, impact (measures and outcomes), learning, technology (GS attributes and characteristics), and industry. \n\n Using these categories, participants identified potential research questions, including how the audience perceives GS films, viewer expectations, the cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral change impacts of the films, best practices for GS films (e.g., content, message, structure, aesthetics etc.), an examination of the characteristics of the medium (e.g., format, scale, engagement, immersion, presence), learning from GS films, and economic and business aspects of the industry.   Participants then identified funding, leadership, participation, methodology and industry buy-in as barriers and constraints to the implementation of a research agenda.\n\nThe workshop included a range of thought leaders from both within and outside the GS community which established connections to support future research.   This small-scale engagement across industry and research disciplines has generated research efforts post-workshop, and demonstrated the viability of collaboration and engagement as a model for future collaborative efforts in promoting GS research.\n\nBroader Impacts: Outcomes\n\n The original proposal aimed for broader impacts through a series of programmatic actions that would build from the breakout discussions: cross-discipline interactions between academics, the giant screen industry, STEM and non-STEM learning programs; giant screen films that are more effective in communicating content; better justification for the inclusion of giant screen films in informal education; and the promotion of research in such areas as technology development, visualization, and cognition.\n\n \n\nAs note previously, the Workshop participants included a range of stakeholders from both within and outside the GS community.  With the support of the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), Workshop results and discussions were hosted through the Museum Screens Community of Practice (http://www.astc.org/profdev/communities/currentCOPs.htm); the site now serves as a collaborative space for questions relating to giant screen, and links GS industry with GS exhibitors and educators in informal science.  The Workshop is also included in the CAISE Research to Practice website (http://informalscience.org/research/research-agendas), as well as disseminated through the GSCA webpages. ..."
