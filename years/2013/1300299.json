 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Oleg V. Ozerov of Texas A&M University Main Campus to explore the potential of a new reaction recently discovered in the investigator's laboratory: dehydrogenative borylation of terminal alkynes (DHBTA). DHBTA is catalyzed by select iridium pincer complexes and converts terminal alkynes directly into alkynylboronates under mild conditions and with excellent selectivity.  Alkynylboronates are very attractive building blocks in organic chemistry that can be used as either sources of the alkynyl group in coupling reactions or as alkynes in various addition and cycloaddition reactions.  The latter set of reactions leads to the formation of new compounds with otherwise difficult to access carbon-boron bonds that can be used for further elaboration into more complex molecules.  This research combines efforts in the design of new pincer ligands and their metal complexes, exploration of the mechanism and scope of DHBTA, and demonstration of the utility of alkynylboronates in alkyne-alkyne coupling to enynes and in Pauson-Khand synthesis of borylated cyclopentenones.  Prof. Ozerov and his research group broaden the impact of their research activities via collaborations with researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions and outside of the US, through involvement of undergraduate students in research at Texas A&M, as well as through outreach to local high schools.\r\n \r\nThe molecular assembly of high-value organic chemicals in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries often relies on catalysis by transition metal compounds.  This research represents a new approach to using well-defined, molecular transition metal complexes to catalyze the formation of compounds with carbon-boron bonds.  Organic compounds containing carbon-boron bonds are extremely versatile as building blocks in the synthesis of complex organic structures.  This project provides new fundamental knowledge about the design and operation of successful transition metal catalysts on the molecular level, explores select uses of the newly accessible building blocks in synthesis, and provides training to a diverse array of students in state-of-the-art chemistry of transition metals and, most importantly, in the art of critical thinking and solving scientific problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEfficient utilization of available chemical feedstocks is a critical component of sustainable development from a chemical point of view.  Homogeneous catalysis that utilizes transition metal complexes is an indispensable tool in accomplishing higher efficiency.  This project focused on the studies of catalytic formation of carbon-boron bonds from easily available carbon-hydrogen bonds, especially as pertains to substrates containing terminal carbon-carbon triple bonds, or alkynes.  Compounds containing carbon-boron bonds, such as the various organoboronates, are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, enabling well-established elaboration of the carbon-boron bond into other organic functionalities and thus higher-value products.  The work on this project identified the first effective catalysts for the conversion of terminal alkynes to the alkynylboronate products.  These catalysts are iridium organometallic complexes supported by ligands containing a central basic nitrogen atom.  The project explored the scope of the reaction and selected applications of alkynylboronates in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules.  Special attention was devoted to the elucidation of the mechanism of the reaction, with the help of computational methods.  In the course of the exploration of complexes possessing metal-boron interaction, we also discovered a highly active catalyst for the borylation of aromatic C-H bonds that appears to operate by a mechanism that is different from the existing iridium catalysts for aromatic C-H borylation.  In the most recent development, we have been able to show that incorporation of a boryl functionality into the supporting ligand for iridium can lead to novel selectivity for the activation of C-H bonds in pyridines.  \n\nThe work on this project has especially benefited from collaborations with researchers in the US and abroad.  These collaborations augment that accomplishments possible under NSF-funded research and create a network for contacts, exchange of ideas, and broadening participation.  Our collaborations have included researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions.  The training of highly qualified personnel has been one of the major outcome of this project.   Seven graduate students who have contributed to the project have obtained PhD degrees and found employment in US chemical companies or at US facilities of international companies.  All five undergraduates who have contributed to this project have either moved on to graduate school or are applying to graduate programs this year.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oleg V Ozerov"
