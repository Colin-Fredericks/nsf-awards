 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Natalie Schilling, Ms. Amelia Tseng will investigate the interrelationship of language, identity, and dialect development among first- and second- generation Latinos in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area through quantitative sociolinguistic analysis of the variable patterning of dialect features found to be associated with Latino speakers in other U.S. locations, and qualitative analysis of how speakers use these features to convey particular social and identity meanings in ongoing conversation. The project is of vital importance in that it (1) enhances our knowledge of how a growing and diverse Latino population uses language to shape new identities in the U.S. context; (2) increases our understanding of emergent language varieties as legitimate language systems with important cultural associations rather than 'imperfect' learner English; and (3) in the long run helps ameliorate linguistic discrimination against Latinos and other minority groups. In addition, although Latino English has been studied to an extent in other U.S. locations, it is understudied in the nation's capital, despite its growing Latino population.\r\n\r\nData will be collected using conversational interviews and participant self-recordings in varied social contexts. Dialect features will be investigated in terms of possible correlation with social factors (for example, immigrant generation, gender, education, orientation to Latino identity), and how and where they occur in discourse. For example, a lower, backed /ae/ pronunciation is variably associated with Latino English (e.g. 'can' does not raise to \"kay-un,\" but may approach \"con\"). Pilot studies suggest that this feature is used with higher frequency when speakers talk about Latino culture, but with lower frequency when they wish to sound authoritative.  This indicates that although Latinos in D.C. may be internalizing derogatory attitudes toward Latino English(es), they nonetheless retain a positive sense of their unique cultural and linguistic heritage. By shedding light on dialect development and identity construction in an immigration context, the results of this study will help to demonstrate the linguistic validity and social importance of Latino English, and, by extension, the cultural legitimacy of all groups of people, whether 'native' to the U.S., immigrant, majority, or minority.",

Specific objectives were 1) to investigate the patterning of pronunciation variation in the English of Washington, D.C.-area Latinos, with a specific focus on one vowel that has been shown to be of importance in other varieties of Latino English, /ae/, as in words like &ldquo;ban&rdquo; and &ldquo;bat&rdquo;, and 2) to consider how variation in /ae/ is used to make social meanings pertaining to group and individual identity, as well as to accomplish interactional goals such as showing affiliation with or distance from particular topics of discussion, and stances taken toward these topics. These questions were investigated using an integrated quantitative and qualitative approach to provide a fuller picture of the linguistic, social, and interactional considerations that influence language variation and identity construction. Findings showed that a variant of /ae/ that is characteristic of other Latino English dialects (i.e. the pronunciation of words like &ldquo;band&rdquo; as similar to &ldquo;bond&rdquo;) was present in the majority of speakers interviewed and carried social and interactional meanings for some.
