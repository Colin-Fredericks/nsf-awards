 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research initiation grant involves a comprehensive study to understand how students? experiences at an academic institution affect students? interest in pursuing a degree in engineering.  The study aims to understand the role of classroom and out of classroom experiences in influencing students? persistence in engineering.  The project will generate new knowledge on activities and experiences that promote retention and those that promote non-persistence.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is that it will help to identify events and experiences that promote students? persistence in engineering.  By understanding the role of the environment in persistence, engineering programs can devise better interventions to deal with the problem of attrition.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of educating and preparing a diverse, world class STEM workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAttrition is a problem that affects all engineering programs in the United States.  Although the statistics on student retention vary by academic institution, in general, for every two students that begin in an engineering program, only one graduates.  The phenomenon of attrition is complex, and several different approaches have been undertaken to understand students? reasons to transfer out of engineering and to identify predictors for non-persistence. \n\nIn this study the researchers studied student retention from the perspective of students? experiences in college.  The main goal is to understand the role of academic difficulty, in class experiences, out of class experiences, and initial interest in engineering, in student?s non-persistence in engineering.  Surveys was the main method of data collection used in the study.  Persistence in engineering, defined as the retention of a student in engineering, was assessed two years after students? entrance into an engineering program. \n\nEngineering classroom experiences were the leading reason for the increase in interest reported by students at the end of their first and second semesters in an engineering program.  Classroom experiences that led to an increase in students? interest in engineering include: experiencing interesting group projects, working in the solution of practical problems, involvement in project management, interesting lectures, and gaining a better understanding of what engineering involves.  According to the surveys, out of class experiences (related or unrelated to engineering) were not significant contributors to increases in interest in engineering.   Preliminary results obtained from the statistical analysis of students? retention data indicate that 2-year persistence in engineering is influenced by the initial interest in engineering, and the first year cumulative GPA. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lizzie Santiago"
