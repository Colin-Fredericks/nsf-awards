 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study aims to improve educational practices by filling critical gaps in research on the impact of relationships on mathematics achievement for Latino students. The study has two main objectives: First, the PIs will use longitudinal data and advanced statistical approaches to understand factors that influence mathematics attitudes and achievement during the transition from elementary to middle school. Second, the PIs will apply the expectancy-value model to the prediction of mathematics behavior and performance. Surveys will be collected from 300 Latino mothers, students, and their math teachers near the end of 5th grade, at the beginning and end of 6th grade, and at the beginning of 7th grade. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is its potential to advance understanding of how and why interest in mathematics develops or declines over time, and how parents and teachers respond to these changes. The work will address broader impacts and benefit society by contributing to the body of literature concerning Latino students in STEM and has the potential to influence both parental behaviors and teaching practices as they relate to underrepresented populations.  A graduate student will be trained to develop and apply analytic tools for interdependent data to STEM education content, helping to address the critical shortage of quantitative methodologists. The findings will be disseminated to researchers, teachers, parent and teacher educators, and parents.",
