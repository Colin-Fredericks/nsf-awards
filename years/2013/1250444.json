 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plate tectonic theory postulates that the Earth's lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates or blocks that move and slide past or toward each other over geological time. Our knowledge of the kinematics and duration of collisional events between various Chinese tectonic blocks and Siberia is still poorly known. Similarly, the accretionary history of the Central Asian fold belt itself is contentious. A lack of basic information regarding the tectonic assembly of asia hinders our understanding of the complex tectonic history of this region. The primary goal of this research is to study the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks from the Junggar Basin, Northwest China, to address key questions that are currently debated:  Terrane Accretionary History of the Central Asian Belt; Coherence of the Junggar Basin; and Excessive Crustal Shortening. A common thread running through the proposed work is to obtain reliable paleomagnetic data bearing on the tectonic and geodynamic evolution of Asia, including the sequence of configurations leading up to collision of oceanic terranes and continental blocks along its southern margin and the large-scale displacements and rotations that ensued during the long process of accretion. To address these questions we are collecting paleomagnetic and geochronologic samples from the Junggar Basin. In addition to the scientific objectives of this research, the project is contributing to the education of graduate and undergraduate students in a STEM discipline and is promoting significant international collaboration with scientists from Taiwan and The Peoples Republic of China. Geophysical insight and refinement of paleogeographic maps from this study may help identify the ancient environments that were conducive to the formation of the rare-metal mineralization and petroleum potential in the central Asian belt region. The scientific results from this project will be germane to a broad range of scientists studying continental tectonics with interests ranging from the growth of the lithosphere to deep-mantle dynamics to examining questions regarding possible relations between plume activity, large igneous province production, and geomagnetic polarity superchrons. The data from this study will be presented at national meetings, reported to the NSF, and disseminated in peer-reviewed, high-profile international journal articles and web-based paleomagnetic database for wider dissemination. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",

We&nbsp;collected paleomagnetic samples from well-exposed and well-described sites of Permian to Cretaceous stratigraphic sections&nbsp;of Junggar basin.

The rocks are mainly limestone and red and gray sediments&nbsp;including siltstone and sandstone. We also sampled folds as many as possible in order to apply paleomagnetic fold tests to check the stability of the remanent magnetization. Our Chinese collaborators&rsquo; extensive knowledge of local outcrops and employments at Chinese government&rsquo;s educational and research institutions have proven indispensable in collecting and exporting samples back to the US for analysis. These samples significantly expand&nbsp;our database, and can be directly compared to our previous paleomagnetic results from Southern Siberia&nbsp;and northern Tibet that&nbsp;we completed previously under NSF grants. Useful results were obtained by progressive demagnetization for gray and red sandstone samples that are dated paleontologically as Late Permian, mid to late Triassic, and late Cretaceous, respectively. Two remanent magnetizations were clearly separated from these samples. The low-temperature component is a post-fold remagnetization acquired in recent times. The high-temperature component is the characteristic remanent magnetization, with the presence of both normal and reversed polarity and evidence of passing a fold test. Comparing with coeval paleomagnetic data from neighboring blocks, paleomagnetic declinations indicate large clockwise vertical-axis rotations (up to 98.3&deg; &plusmn;16&deg;) may have occurred between sampling sites in Junggar Basin and&nbsp;North China Block during the time interval of Late Triassic and Late Cretaceous.&nbsp;The rotation pattern correlates with the regional structural trend variations. The paleomagnetically inferred latitudinal displacements between Junggar and South China Block are general statistically insignificant, as well as the rotational data. These data thus suggest that Junggar Basin may have been very close to South China Block during the Triassic time&nbsp;and together they reveal a large rotation of some 98&deg;. A plausible cause of the rotation is that it responded the westward rotational closure of the South and North China Blocks, which is inferred to have occurred during the Mid-Late Triassic according to several geologic and tectonic analyses. It is likely that the relative rotations in Junggar Basin occurred during a major regional deformation and may ended before Late Cretaceous.
