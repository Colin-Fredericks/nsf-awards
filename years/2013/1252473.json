 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Massachusetts Linking Experiences and Pathways Follow-on (M-LEAP 2) is a three-year longitudinal empirical research study that will continue examining prospectively how early formal and informal STEM education experiences are related to gender-based differences in STEM achievement-related choices in middle and high school. M-LEAP 2 will serve as a complement to and extension of the current NSF-funded M-LEAP, a primarily quantitative research study that has followed overlapping cohorts of 3rd - 6th grade female and male students for three years. M-LEAP surveyed over 1,600 students, 627 student-parent pairs, and 134 second parents in 8 diverse public schools across Massachusetts. In contrast, M-LEAP 2 is a heavily qualitative three-year study using in-depth interviews with 84 of the current students and their families.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is that it will add to the explanatory model of STEM-related achievement choices, including prospective career selection, and the gender disparities in STEM fields, specifically by examining students at an earlier time point than has heretofore been studied. \r\n\r\nRegarding broader impacts, study results should build awareness among both informal and formal STEM educators regarding gender differences in early STEM experiences and their relationship to future choices. The knowledge gained should help stakeholders conduct activities that will narrow gender gaps, take an informed approach to engaging both girls and boys in STEM, and work with parents to understand various sources of influence on their child's achievement-related choices.",

(GRG), is a continuation of the original <em>M-LEAP: Massachusetts Linking Experiences and Pathways</em> project. M-LEAP was a three-year large-scale quantitative research study of nearly 1,600 students, investigating the childhood factors underlying the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers in the United States. M-LEAP2&rsquo;s focus has been largely <em>qualitative</em>, focused on a diverse subset of 72 students (38 boys and 34 girls selected from the larger M-LEAP sample) and their families (N=129 parents, N=52 siblings) for three additional years. Students were in 3<sup>rd</sup> through 6<sup>th</sup> grade at the start of M-LEAP and were in 9<sup>th</sup> through 12<sup>th</sup> at the end of M-LEAP2.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to uncover key factors that, over time, influence students&rsquo; interest in pursuing STEM careers. GRG researchers used a combination of in-depth, in-person interviews and surveys with students (nine time points), their parents, and siblings. We asked about students&rsquo; identities; their experiences in and out of school; attitudes towards school subjects and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills; students&rsquo; and parents&rsquo; Self-Efficacy beliefs (how competent they thought the student was at various school subjects and skills); students&rsquo; Subjective Task Value beliefs (how useful and interesting they thought these subjects were); gender stereotype beliefs; students&rsquo; motivations for engaging in different activities; relationships with teachers, family, and friends; and students&rsquo; career aspirations.</p>\n<p>We combined the vast qualitative data into longitudinal &ldquo;collections&rdquo; of interview notes, organized by family unit and time point, exploring the individual students&rsquo; and families&rsquo; progressions over time, while also comparing students&rsquo; responses across the sample. We also conducted descriptive and inferential statistical analyses for each of six survey time points.</p>\n<p>Results showed multiple major influences on students&rsquo; beliefs, interests, and aspirations. Students believe that their parents, especially mothers, are their strongest influencers and motivators. Parents influence their children by supporting and encouraging students&rsquo; interests and school work, talking about what students do in school, highlighting the importance of being well-rounded and doing well across the board, and emphasizing the importance of understanding content and processes in contrast to solely emphasizing good grades. Students&rsquo; out-of-school activities and older siblings additionally play key roles in helping students to develop their interests and talents.</p>\n<p>Teachers also play a highly influential role in helping to turn students toward or away from potential STEM careers. As positive influencers, they make subjects engaging for students by demonstrating their own passion for the topic, engaging them in &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; interdisciplinary problem-solving, employing hands-on, constructivist teaching approaches, being personable and relatable, and holding high academic expectations for their students. In contrast, as negative influencers, teachers can &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; students to STEM subjects through a lack of enthusiasm, preparation, or fresh pedagogical style.</p>\n<p>Self-identity is also a strong influencer. Students sense when parents, teachers, or other adults believe they are competent in a particular subject, which leads to internalization. Most students believed that they were competent at science, math, and computers, though their interest and perception of utility was somewhat lower. Gender stereotypes were notable; on rating scales, students endorsed girls as being better at English-language arts (ELA) and teamwork and endorsed boys as being better at computers. Students were more gender neutral regarding science and math.</p>\n<p>Approximately half the students consistently aspired to non-STEM careers, 20% to strict STEM (primarily boys), 15% to Allied Health (primarily girls), and 10% STEM-related. (See Exhibits 1-2.) The 20 students who consistently aspired to STEM-based careers were more likely to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify as a STEM subject matter person (typically science and/or math). </li>\n<li>Identify as being learning-oriented, intelligent, and creative.</li>\n<li>Believe that &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; in&nbsp; a subject means understanding content material and feeling engaged in a topic, in addition to receiving good grades. </li>\n<li>Engage in out-of-school science, math and independent engineering activities. </li>\n<li>Have one or both parents with STEM degrees (but not necessarily STEM jobs).</li>\n<li>Have parents who encourage them to pursue their passion and push them to achieve.</li>\n<li>Be encouraged strongly by older siblings to pursue STEM-based interests and careers.</li>\n<li>Have STEM teachers who are engaging, pique their interest in a subject, or foster interest in potential STEM careers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intellectual merit of this research is that it has added to the explanatory model of STEM-related achievement choices, including prospective career selection and gender disparities in STEM fields, by specifically examining a time point much earlier than had previously been researched by others. Also, while many studies examined STEM interests from middle school onward, or interviewed scientists retrospectively, few had prospectively investigated earlier formative childhood experiences.</p>\n<p>Regarding broader impacts, results from M-LEAP2 can help build awareness among families and educators regarding gender differences in early STEM beliefs, interests, experiences, and aspirations and their relationship to future choices. This will contribute to broader STEM participation, especially for young women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/24/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Irene&nbsp;F&nbsp;Goodman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252473/1252473_10278656_1500922128331_M-LEAP2GirlsOnlySankey--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252473/1252473_10278656_1500922128331_M-LEAP2GirlsOnlySankey--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Girls&rsquo; Career Aspirations in 6th and 8th Grades\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252473/1252473_10278656_1500922128331_M-LEAP2GirlsOnlySankey--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Girls&rsquo; Career Aspirations in 6th and 8th Grades\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">N=20 girls</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">GRG</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Irene&nbsp;F&nbsp;Goodman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Girls?
