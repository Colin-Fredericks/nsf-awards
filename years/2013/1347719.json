 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Widening Implementation & Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER) planning grant provides faculty at the University of West Georgia's College of Science and Mathematics (COSM) with increased support in the use of evidence-based teaching and learning practices. A Core Learning Team (CLT) comprised of at least ten faculty members from six departments (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, Mathematics, and Physics)is participating in professional development activities designed to increase their ability to develop and implement effective evidence-based teaching practices.\r\n\r\nAligning with best practices in facilitating institutional change, this program (Wider Implementation of STEM Educational Reforms, WISER) Practices] is focusing on changing the knowledge and attitudes of STEM faculty and university administrators with the goal of institutionalizing practices that will increase student success. Additionally, a rigorous evaluation of the program is providing both quantitative and qualitative data that will advance knowledge and contribute to the growing literature on evidence-based teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: As COSM faculty increasingly value and engage in best practices in STEM learning, and as the University of West Georgia shows a commitment to rewarding these faculty, the institution expects to see significant increases in student learning, STEM majors, and retention in STEM courses. As a result, the University will be better able to meet the demands for graduates in STEM fields who can contribute to the economic growth of the state of Georgia and beyond.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNEED\n\nThere is a well-identified need at the national and state levels for the preparation of STEM majors. \n\nThe impetus for the WIDER grant at West Georgia (UWG) was that evidence-based teaching and learning practices were found to be critical for student success in STEM disciplines, based on several successful pilot projects funded by the Georgia Board of Regents (2011-2016).  Nevertheless, the Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics (COSM), the PI of the NSF-WIDER grant, and several key faculty members concluded that it was necessary to develop a strategic approach to expand the university?s commitment to evidence-based teaching and learning (EBPs) in STEM disciplines. \n\n \n\nGOALS\n\nThe overarching goals of this project (2013-2016) were (1) to facilitate the creation of a shared vision across the STEM disciplines for using evidence-based teaching and learning practices to (a) improve student learning, (b) increase the number of majors, (c) increase retention and (d) increase timely graduation, and (2) to create a plan to institutionalize this vision.\n\n \n\nAPPROACH\n\nOur approach was based on the theoretical framework of Kezar (Understanding sensemaking/sensegiving in transformational change processes from the bottom up. Higher Education, 65, 761-780), and consists of three steps:\n\n \n\n(1) Collection and examination of data on EBPs as well as barriers, support structure, and institutional cultural factors affecting implementation of EBPs.
