The week-long school, scheduled for June 23-28, 2013 on Princeton University Campus, offers courses on Combustion Theory, Combustion Chemistry, Quantitative Diagnostics for Combustion Chemistry and Propulsion, and Computational Turbulent Combustion.  After-class sessions are also scheduled to enhance the experience of the students.  The proposed funding is to provide partial support to students who will be participating in the Summer School.",
