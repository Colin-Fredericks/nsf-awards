 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chrys Wesdemiotis at the University of Akron and his group will develop multidimensional mass spectrometry methodologies for the microstructure characterization of synthetic polymers.  Liquid chromatography and ion mobility separation will be combined with tandem mass spectrometry to characterize novel amphiphiles, hybrid materials, glycopolymers, biodegradable polymers, and self-assembled macromolecular systems.  The ultimate goal is accurate identification of the corresponding compositions, connectivities, and architectures in order to ascertain the structural elements that control macroscopic properties and, thus, facilitate the design of advanced materials for specific tasks.  Many synthetic polymers are engineered for biomedical applications.  These materials are invisible to cells unless proteins attach to their surface.  A second goal of this project is to probe if changes occur to proteins that interact with synthetic polymers and to quantify protein adhesion on polymers prepared for biomedical and clinical use.  A third, related objective concerns the advancement of methods that probe the surface layer of synthetic polymers, so that alterations resulting from environmental factors or segregation phenomena can be determined.\r\n\r\nA major motivation for the planned studies is the need for sensitive chemical analyses of the novel materials produced for industrial and clinical purposes at the University of Akron and its industrial partners in Northeast Ohio.  The methods developed in this project will help chemists to design and produce better performing and commercially important materials for a variety of uses such as medical implants, drug delivery compounds, and high performance plastics.  At the same time, the planned research activities will educate and train American undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, in modern materials research and mass spectrometry techniques, two areas with growing employment opportunities that are vital for the nation's technological progress.",

A major impetus of the work performed was the need for sensitive and comprehensive chemical analyses of the new macromolecular materials designed and produced at the University of Akron (UA) and its local, national, and international partners in academia and industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The multidimensional methods developed interface a soft ionization method with mass analysis (MS dimension), tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation (MS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>&nbsp;dimension), liquid chromatography fractionation (LC dimension), and/or orthogonal separation of the ionized sample by ion mobility (IM dimension).&nbsp; Various combinations of these events were optimized, depending on the physicochemical properties of the macromolecular sample and the analytical problem faced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest approach, viz. 2D or tandem mass spectrometry (MS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>), has been successfully employed to decipher copolymer sequences and to differentiate and elucidate linear vs. cyclic or branched architectures.&nbsp; This ability results from differences in the fragmentation energetics between comonomers, the lower bond dissociation threshold at branching centers, and the higher kinetic stability of macrocycles where more than one bond must be broken to produce observable fragments.&nbsp; The connectivity information derived by MS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>&nbsp;is essential for understanding the relationship between chemical structure and macroscopic properties of new synthetic polymers, so that their structure can be fine-tuned to afford the properties needed for a specific task.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis of polymer blends and mixtures generally requires coupling MS with LC and/or IM separation.&nbsp; Our studies with amphiphilic blends and nonionic surfactants indicated that adequate characterization is afforded by either reversed-phase LC, which separates by polarity, or IM, which separates according to charge and shape of the ions generated after sample ionization.&nbsp; For more challenging analytical problems, LC-MS and IM-MS must be combined to enable separation by polarity in the LC dimension and by shape in the IM dimension before MS analysis.&nbsp; This approach is called for if the blend contains components with similar polarity but different architecture and vice versa.&nbsp; Given the importance of amphiphilic blends in polymer science, the structural detail offered by LC-IM-MS is essential for understanding their physicochemical properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LC-MS is less suitable for supramolecular polymers because such materials tend to be weakly bonded and cannot survive intact interactions with the stationary phase.&nbsp; This problem is overcome by IM-MS which, together with our newly developed energy-resolved IM-MS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>&nbsp;method (&ldquo;gradient tandem mass spectrometry&rdquo; or gMS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>), has been employed in this project to characterize a number of coordinatively bound supramolecular assemblies with varying size and complexity.&nbsp; The IM step not only enables separation of remaining reactants and side products, but also reveals the collision cross-sections (CCS) of the examined complexes which are an important physical parameter diagnostic of their size and architecture.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the gMS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2&nbsp;</span>dimension probes the dissociation energies of the constructs, thereby providing insight about their intrinsic stabilities.&nbsp; Many new assemblies have been discovered in these studies, and several of them were shown to undergo concentration-dependent fission/fusion or charge-dependent contraction/expansion, which could be exploited in guest molecule encapsulation and delivery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our studies on metallosupramolecular polymers pioneered a multidimensional mass spectrometry methodology for the molecular level characterization of weakly bonded or reactive polymers and polymer-biomolecule conjugates that cannot be crystallized or purified for identification by common spectroscopic methods, such as NMR or X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.&nbsp; The entire analysis is performed in milliseconds inside the mass spectrometer by IM-MS and MS<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</span>&nbsp;experiments, without prior offline purification, derivatization, or degradation (&ldquo;top-down&rdquo; method).&nbsp; This methodology has been applied successfully to determine the composition, connectivity, and architecture of synthetic glycopolymers, hybrid materials composed of peptides attached covalently to hydrophilic or hydrophobic synthetic polymers, and biodegradable copolyesters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polymer characterization focus of this project has led to strong and ongoing collaborations with academic and (especially) industrial researchers both locally as well as nationally and internationally.&nbsp; Through these collaborations, the methods advanced in this project have been accessible to polymer scientists seeking assistance to solve analytical problems by mass spectrometry, thus promoting scientific advancement and economic development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-four peer-reviewed publications, five Ph.D. dissertations, twenty-five invited seminars, and thirty-six contributed talks or posters have resulted from this project.&nbsp; Twelve graduate students (four male and eight female) have been directly involved in this project.&nbsp; These students and the PI have also mentored twenty-two undergraduate students (eighteen male and four female; eighteen UA chemistry majors and four REU students) and three high school ACS-SEED students (two males, including one African American, and one female), who completed research assignments related with this project.&nbsp; All project participants learned about fundamental chemistry concepts and, at the same time, they gained experience in an analytical method that is increasingly used to solve structural problems across many disciplines.&nbsp;
