 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at addressing the fundamental problem of how to maximize the efficiency of access to the wireless medium.  In recent years, new information-theoretic solutions have emerged, some of which can now be implemented due to technological advances.  Also, long engrained notions, such as half duplex, are being challenged.  It has been shown that through a combination of strategies at the physical layer and signal processing, full duplex systems are indeed feasible. These developments have radically altered the very notion of what a spatio-temporal resource is.  These developments have necessitated a thorough redefinition and appraisal of the problem of efficient access as addressed in this project.\r\n\r\nOver the years, developments have taken place in parallel and somewhat in isolation in the physical layer community and in the protocol community. By bringing together a broad-spectrum of expertise from both areas, this project envisages fundamental advances in wireless networking at the access layer.  The core challenge is how to use the scarce resources of 'space' and 'time' as efficiently as possible.  In addition, distributed operation, channel fading, time-varying channel conditions, and fast time-scales of transmission opportunities and decisions, exacerbate the problem.  This project has the potential of making a transformative advancement in the science of medium access.",
