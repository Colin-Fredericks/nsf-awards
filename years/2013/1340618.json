  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis report presents findings from a National Science Foundation funded workshop, \"Catalyzing Discovery for Social Impact: Exploring the Power of the Research-Academic-Policy Nexus to Stimulate Policy Innovation.\"  This two-day event, held September 4-6, 2013, brought together national policymakers, policy school deans and faculty, research center and think tank leadership, and practitioners, to provide new understandings of how innovative social science research is successfully translated to the policy sector through partnerships between academics, researchers, and policymakers. The workshop was designed to accomplish the following: \n\nA systematic exploration of factors undergirding successful collaborative relationships between academics and policymakers,\nExamination of key processes and mechanisms which help drive the movement of innovative social science research into the policymaking sphere,\nIdentification of characteristics, skills, and motivations of those who form and nurture relationships between academia and the policy community, and \nIdentification of key characteristics, incentives, cultures, and operations of the academic and policy communities that facilitate the movement of innovative research products to public stakeholders. \n\n\nTo drive initial discussions at the workshop, key questions were designed to reveal core features of each element:\n\nEnvironment: What environmental characteristics exist within each sector that create fertile ground for translating research into practical policy solutions? \nLeadership: What individual or collective leadership qualities are present within those who seek to enable the translation of social science research into usable policy solutions?  \nProcess: What dynamics emerge to support effective interactions between the scientific and policymaking communities and how are these operationalized?\n\n\nWorkshop Day 1 Findings\n\nFour individuals from the larger sample of possible workshop participants prepared written descriptions of their organizations and experiences, which served as illustrative cases to start the workshop discussions.  The written cases shared similar features:\n\n1)    Institutions and leaders were open to taking a risk and supported the \"catalysts\" in explicit ways,\n\n2)    Participants in the collaboration were committed to the process,\n\n3)    Catalytic qualities present in the policy entrepreneur/boundary spanner,\n\n4)    Built off of pre-existing networks, initiatives, and formal structures; focused on long-term relationship building,\n\n5)    Aligned professional interests of partners and created shared value in the initiative\u00c6s goals, and\n\n6)    New incentives and methodologies for participation developed\n\nIn addition, four core insights emerged by the end of day 1:\n\n1)    Incentives governing the academic community undermine the potential success of the research-policy nexus in creating and delivering innovative policy solutions,\n\n2)    Established relationships and trust are vital components of successful collaborative efforts.  These relationships are difficult to build and sustain,\n\n3)    The methods used to move useful and relevant research and knowledge from the academic sector to the policymaking sector are not well known or documented.  A mapping of this movement would be useful in determining successful features of the associated processes, and\n\n4)    The processes of translating social science research and knowledge to affect social change are not well researched.  Support for, and conduct of, further study is needed.\n\nDay 2 Findings \n\nThe workshop participants developed project ideas in three key areas deemed most in need of new insights: research, curriculum and training needs, and community/network building.\n\nKey Workshop Findings: Day 2\n\nParticipants developed 4 project ideas, deemed to have the greatest immediate impact on building stronger, more sustainable research-policy exchanges:\n\n1)    Incentive Structure Design Competition: an incentive structur..."
