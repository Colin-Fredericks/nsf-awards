Besides technical paper presentations, MobiCom, through this grant, will be able to stimulate several intellectual activities by students including potentially killer apps (through the mobile app competition) and breakthrough research (through the student research competition, and the S3 workshop). Furthermore, the conference offers several opportunities for intellectually stimulating discussions between\r\nthe students and researchers from around the world.\r\n\r\nThe participation of students in MobiCom can have an important impact on their development as a junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.",
