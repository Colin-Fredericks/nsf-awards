 "awd_abstract_narration": "perfSONAR (http://www.perfsonar.net) is a set of community-developed protocols and a widely-adopted infrastructure for multi-domain network performance monitoring, facilitating the ability to collect and share measurement data relevant to solve end-to-end network performance problems and to enable network-aware applications.  The first perfSONAR workshop was successfully held 8-9 July 2010 in Arlington, VA.  This project will organize and hold the Second perfSONAR workshop to be held February 20-21 2014 at at the NSF in Arlington VA, open to members of the perfSONAR community. The goal of the second workshop is to build upon the first workshop outcomes and capitalize on the inherent flexible multi-domain nature of the perfSONAR protocols and infrastructure. The intended focus is to cross-fertilize ideas from a variety of stakeholders that include: researchers, applications developers, network operators, network managers, and others with an interest in network research and performance measurement/monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe workshop goals include:\r\n     1. Identification of unimplemented techniques and network research focus areas with existing ideas that can help solve problems of R&E networks, as well as open research questions focused on solving real world end-to-end performance problems;\r\n     2. Identification of required perfSONAR infrastructure components for network operators, end users, network researchers, and virtual organizations, and any missing components;\r\n     3. Operational requirements, federation policies and best practices for ongoing and on-demand measurements end-to-end, cross-domain, and transoceanic links; and\r\n     4. Creating a larger perfSONAR community seeded by the workshop participants, including strategies for engaging new network researchers, new domain science researchers, new science communities, and new networks.\r\n\r\nperfSONAR is a tool supporting multiple high-priority programs in multiple U.S. agencies.  It is a key tool for network diagnostics for in the High Performance Computing community.   As such enhancements to the perfSONAR framework have direct impacts on projects across a wide range of disciplines.  The output of the workshop will be a report suitable for archival within the ACM Digital Library. The report will summarize the discussions and recommendations of participants in accordance with the aforementioned workshop goals, and could serve to inform and guide future community actions.",
