The workshop seeks to engage approximately 70 geochronologists and geoscientists with the intent to: 1) develop a set of unifying requirements for the organization of geochronology data; and 2) explore methods for developing and sustaining an interactive community of domain and cyber-scientists to pursue next-generation solutions to the identified challenges.  The workshop will include invited talks followed by multiple breakout groups to discuss and produce draft documents focused on: 1) specific scientific challenges and opportunities in Geochronology over the next 5-15 years; 2) identification of the data and cyber-infrastructure obstacles to meeting those challenges; 3) a compilation of known community data and modeling resources; 4) description of data and cyber-capabilities required to meet challenges; and 5) development of ideas for at least two ?proof-of-concept? projects or test cases for scientifically transformative CI activities.\r\n\r\nNothing is more fundamental to understanding Earth history and processes than geochronology and the expense incurred in producing robust and high resolution dates implores NSF to help find a modern digital solution(s) for maintaining the integrity of these data sets and promoting access as broadly as possible in support of the advancement of the geosciences.  This workshop will help to address many of the issues that continue to hamper geochonological data curation, digital publication and community access.",

There is also recognition that investment in cyberinfrastructure has the potential to improve access to high-quality dates, models, age calculation tools, and recalculation tools that will benefit geochronologists as well as the many end-users of geochronology data.\nGrand Challenge:\n\nDevelop a fully integrated four-dimensional digital earth, of which geochronology provides the crucial fourth dimension, to fully understand dynamic earth system evolution.\n\nOutcome 1: Science Drivers\n\nThe primary scientific driver identified during the workshop if EarthCube were successful would be to understand and test hypotheses about the underlying controls on, and the relationships between, major earth systems. Achievement of this goal will entail establishing:\n\n?      a robust, unified chronological framework for all earth history;\n\n?      correlation of earth system records across a range of nested spatio-temporal scales;\n\n?      causality between forcing, responses and feedbacks, including leads and lags;\n\n?      rates of change of fundamental earth system processes.\n\nThe above provides a general framework for the goals of the geochronologic community within EarthCube. Specific examples of scientific opportunities and challenges facing the geochronologic community over the next 15 years that will lead to resolution of the dynamic interactions among Earth systems include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n?      the construction of a digital absolute geologic time scale used to resolve the times and drivers for biologic extinction as well as the  rates of biologic recovery and evolution;\n\n?      the pace, magnitude and drivers of climate change through earth history (e.g., the carbon cycle, oxygen, sea level, ocean chemistry);\n\n?      addition of a 4th dimension to the construction and evolution of the North American continent, providing knowledge products to be directly integrated with EarthScope data;\n\n?      resolving interactions between rates, patterns, and magnitudes of erosion, landscape evolution, and sediment deposition, with climate change and tectonics in deep and more recent time.\nOutcome 2: Data &amp; Cyberinfrastructure obstacles\n\n?      Geochronological data are currently difficult to access, of variable quality, and challenging to compare between labs/methods and with other information;\n\n?      Limited standardization of data acquisition, archiving and delivery protocols across the geochronologic  community;\n\n?      The need to archive legacy data and develop mechanisms for managing the current data explosion, so that new and existing data can be leveraged;\n\n?      Domain-specific data architectures are vastly incomplete or absent altogether and require the development and maintenance of software designed for the reduction and archiving of geochronologic data, designed to remain flexible for unanticipated data additions;\n\n?      There is a lack of transformative technology for integrating earth system knowledge -- data at present are locked in domain-specific architectures;\n\n?      It is difficult to recognize gaps and data deserts in existing datasets, and disconnects betwee..."
