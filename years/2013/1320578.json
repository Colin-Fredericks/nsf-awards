 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software has become a critical infrastructure in our society with its\r\npervasive use in all kinds of products from home appliances to\r\nautomobiles, from individual pacemakers and smart phones to air\r\ntraffic control systems and high-end computers in large-scale power\r\ngrids. During software development, the build process is vital to make\r\nsure that a software product is correctly and reliably constructed and\r\nconfigured in accordance with different users' operation environments,\r\noperating systems, platforms, and devices. To reliably build a\r\nsoftware product, a build tool is used to execute build code to\r\ngenerate the executable and deliverable files according to the rules\r\nspecified in the build files. As a software project evolves over time,\r\nbuild code continually evolves and is defect-prone due to the high\r\nrate of changes and complexity of the build files. The complexity of\r\nbuild code leads to two important issues. First, the maintenance of\r\ncomplex build code has imposed much extra effort on software\r\ndevelopers. Second, its complexity is a source for configuration and\r\nbuild errors in software development.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve software reliability with a comprehensive\r\napproach to develop a scientific foundation for build code analysis to\r\nprovide automatic supports for 1) build code maintenance and 2)\r\ndetecting, testing, and locating configuration and build errors. We\r\nwill first examine configuration and build code errors and related maintenance \r\ntasks in real-world projects. Second, we will develop a scientific foundation\r\nwith novel concepts, techniques, and algorithms for build code static\r\nanalysis, build code smell and configuration error detection,\r\nrefactoring, and change analysis. Third, we will investigate a\r\nfoundation for build code dynamic analysis and leverage it to support\r\nfault localization in build code given a reported build\r\nfailure. Finally, a theoretical foundation and tool supports\r\n(e.g. semi-automatic test generation) for build code testing will be\r\ndeveloped. Our research will fundamentally advance the body of\r\nknowledge in theoretical foundation for software building, build code\r\nanalysis and maintenance. Our results will lead to more reliable\r\nsoftware and improvement in code quality as well as in the developers'\r\nproductivity. Our validation efforts involve students and\r\nprofessionals, promoting teaching and training in information\r\nassurance and software reliability.",
