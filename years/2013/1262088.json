 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the fieldwork and research for Carolina Aragon's doctoral dissertation to produce a comprehensive grammar of Akunts\u00fa, a Tup\u00edan language spoken by monolinguals in Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil. Until recently the Akunts\u00fa people were an isolated indigenous group, but now, because of a genocidal massacre, there are only five remaining speakers.  This has left Akunts\u00fa a critically endangered language. \r\n\r\nThis project's main goal is to provide a comprehensive grammar of the language which will be informed by language typology and current linguistic theory.  The grammatical description of Akunts\u00fa will contribute to our understanding of the typological traits of the Tupar\u00edan subfamily and to linguistic typology in general. Ultimately it will also contribute to the reconstruction of Proto-Tupar\u00edan, with implications for Proto-Tup\u00edan. \r\n\r\nOther documentary materials will also be produced; for example, important aspects of Akunts\u00fa culture and history that have survived despite of the traumatic past will be recorded and archived. Documentation and production of linguistic, ethnographic, and lexicographic materials will be important not only to represent the structure of the language, but also to reveal the way that Akunts\u00fa people see and understand their world. As part of a long-term goal, pedagogical materials will be created and the dictionary will be expanded ultimately to produce a talking dictionary.\r\n\r\nBy studying a group that still lives as its ancestors did, this project will provide contributions for scientific fields interested in the study of Amazonian native inhabitants and their cultural diversity. The general public will also benefit from having access to data and materials which will not only be relevant for linguistics, but also to scholars interested in learning more about Brazilian indigenous languages, society, and culture.",
