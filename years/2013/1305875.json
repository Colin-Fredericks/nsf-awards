 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nThis project will use a combination of experimental observations and theoretical investigations to elucidate the properties of Brownian vortexes, a newly discovered category of stochastic machines that use random thermal forces to transduce energy into motion. Whereas conventional deterministic machines waste energy punching through fluctuations, stochastic machines instead take advantage of random forces to work through their thermodynamic cycles.  Unlike other stochastic machines, Brownian vortexes evolve in static force fields that combine conservative traps and non-conservative driving forces. Analogs of such systems are believed to occur in biochemical, social and financial networks.  Developing a fundamental understanding of how Brownian vortexes work will provide doctoral dissertations for two graduate students and honors theses for four undergraduate Physics majors. This experimental program already has fostered the development of the first practical tractor beams and the first knotted force fields, both of which also have immediate real-world applications.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nMuch of our nation's technology is based on combinations of elementary machines, such as wheels, levers and screws.  This project will elucidate the properties of a new type of elementary machine called a Brownian vortex that uses random thermal noise to transform energy into motion.  The program's fundamental goals are to develop a deep physical understanding of how Brownian vortexes work and how to recognize and characterize them when they arise naturally in complex systems.  This program will provide doctoral disserations for two graduate students and honors theses for four undergraduate Physics majors. The experiments on which these students will work take advantage of state-of-the-art techniques of optical micromanipulation, in which the forces and torques exerted by computer-designed holograms are used to create and drive microscopic machines both to advance fundamental knowledge and also for practical applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed and demonstrated powerful new principles for designing optical holograms and acoustic holograms that can trap and transport small objects along any desired path in three dimensions.  This new framework for computational holography has enabled such breakthroughs as the first knotted force field, with applications ranging from fundamental statistical physics to practical applications in fusion energy generation.  Its ultimate expression has been the first experimental demonstration of tractor beams, traveling waves of light or sound that can pull illuminated objects backwards along their entire length. This is a very surprising outcome because traveling waves commonly are understood to push, but not to pull.  The discovery of highly structured waves that exert retrograde forces has sparked vigorous research activity around the world, not least because tractor beams have been a staple of science fiction stories for nearly a century.  Experimental studies of tractor beams illustrate previously unrecognized principles of light-matter interactions, and also have practical applications for sample collection in cometary and planetary exploration.  Holographic trapping has been widely adopted by research groups and industrial laboratories around the world.  Tractor beams, in particularly, and being readied for real-world applications.\n\nThe same program also produced a major breakthrough in materials characterization through its development of holographic particle characterization, a technology that naturally complements holographic trapping.  Holographic particle characterization rapidly and precisely measures the sizes and compositions of micrometer-scale colloidal particles dispersed in fluid media.  This wealth of particle-characterization data surpasses anything that came before and creates valuable new avenues for product development, process control and quality assurance across a broad swath of industries.  Holographic particle characterization has been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry to detect dangerous protein aggregates in novel drugs.  It plays a similar role in semiconductor manufacturing, where it prevents damage by oversized particles in precision polishing slurries.\n\nWhen put together, holographic manipulation and holographic characterization constitute a powerful testbed for seeking out nature's fundamental organizing principles.  This combination already has proved its worth through the discovery and explanation of Brownian vortexes, a class of noise-driven cyclic processes that emerge naturally in biological, financial and social networks.  Both the principles and the techniques that have emerged from these studies should have a lasting impact on experimental research in soft-matter physics.  They also should have a rapid and economically important influence on real-world applications across multiple industries that rely on the properties of colloids and other soft materials.\n\nThis work already has received substantial public attention.  The invention of true tractor beams was featured in \"Building Star Trek,\" a Smithsonian Channel documentary that aired in 2016.  It also has provided a rich platform for educational and community outreach.  The Principal Investigator personally provides laboratory tours to several hundred elementary school students every year.  Through collaborations with community outreach programs such as the Biobus, the learning modules developed for this program reach another 25,000 students and members of the public every year.  The visual and hands-on nature of holographic manipulation lends itself to explaning profound physical principles.  The particular application to soft-matter systems opens peoples' eyes to the opportunities for scientific research all around us in our everyday lives.  All of these activities are embodied in the Scientific Frontiers Program that the Principal Investigator founded in 2006 in collaboration with principals from local public schools.  It has now become a keystone program in NYU's overall science outreach strategy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David G Grier"
