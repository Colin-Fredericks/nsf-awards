The specific goal of the Workshop is to bring together leading American, Czech and European academic researchers to explore the next frontiers in photonics research and development. Leading experts from the US and the Czech Republic academia will present the current state of the art in photonics, identify emerging areas, and establish new international collaborations. The workshop topics will include non-linear optics, EUV - soft x-rays, microstructured and specialty fibers, optical sensors, optical manipulators, metamaterials, and THz and Mid IR photonics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This workshop will provide a forum for academic experts to review recent and exciting breakthroughs in photonics, to establish collaborations, and to determine future research needs. The cross-pollination of scientific ideas will impact science and society in both the US and the Czech Republic. Selected US doctoral students will be given the opportunity to share their research work with European counterparts and to gain international perspectives. The Workshop is expected to establish future exchange programs for a diverse group of graduate or undergraduate students and their advisors. A summary report that contains the presentation files as well as the discussion outcomes will be disseminated via the Workshop website hosted at Stevens Institute of Technology and will be made available to the broader photonics research community and the general public.\r\n",
