 "awd_abstract_narration": "Serious physical design issues are breaking down traditional abstractions\r\nin computer systems and motivating computer architects to turn to\r\nhardware specialization. Hardware specialized for a single task will\r\nalmost always be of higher performance and more efficient, in terms of\r\nsilicon area and energy consumption, compared to a flexible hardware\r\nimplementation that can handle many different tasks. Resolving this\r\ntension between less efficient general architectures and more efficient\r\nspecialized architectures, particularly within the context of mainstream\r\ncomputing platforms, is one of the grand challenges facing the computer\r\narchitecture community.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on an observation of how software engineers address\r\nanalogous challenges in the very applications targeted for\r\nspecialization. Software engineers seek to create specialized yet\r\nflexible code, and the ubiquitous approach is to develop carefully\r\ncrafted libraries of algorithms and data structures that are polymorphic\r\nover the types of input, output, and stored values. The key idea is to\r\nleverage the effort software engineers have already invested and explore\r\npolymorphic hardware specialization in the form of polymorphic\r\nalgorithm-specific units and polymorphic data-structure-specific units\r\nfor template-based software libraries. The project is using a vertically\r\nintegrated approach to investigate polymorphic hardware specialization\r\nfrom a variety of perspectives including computer architecture, hardware\r\nsynthesis, compiler optimization, and runtime systems. The techniques\r\ndeveloped as part of this project will be an important step towards\r\naddressing the physical design issues, which threaten to disrupt the\r\nlong-standing trend towards ever increasing computing performance relied\r\non by all aspects of modern society.",
