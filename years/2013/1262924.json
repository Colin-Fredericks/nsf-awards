 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU site program at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers. The REU will engage ten undergraduate students each year in cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Cellular Bioengineering. Several projects fall within the Biomaterials realm, which generally features elements of chemistry (e.g., synthetic, analytical, and/or physical) with contributions from interdisciplinary fields such as molecular bioengineering (e.g., biofunctionalization of substrates), nanoscale and microscale patterning of materials, and interfacial thermodynamics and transport phenomena. Projects within the Stem Cell Bioengineering theme may involve the development of new technologies to analyze properties of stem cell niches or the directed manipulation of stem cell cultures for expansion and/or differentiation. A few projects involve development of technologies that are applicable to a variety of cellular systems, and may or may not utilize stem cells directly, such as microfabircated devices and novel biomedical optics. Specific examples of projects include: Multi-modal cues for phenotypic control of neural cells; Targeted systemic and intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides; Reprogrammed Stem Cells and 3-D Microenvironments; Metabolic engineering of liver cells for transplantation; and Label-free microscopy for analysis of subcellular structural dynamics.  \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this REU program is to continue to provide unique opportunities for a diverse population of undergraduate students to perform cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Cellular Bioengineering. The program provides invaluable training and experience to under-represented students, including those with limited prior research exposure, and has standardized elements of research training and professional development to accelerate the learning curve and inoculate the students into active laboratories pursuing high-impact research. Unlike the traditional mono-disciplinary research that undergraduates typically conduct, in the past three years this program has successfully leveraged broad-based training related to 'engineering' research projects, but integrated across life sciences and physical sciences. The research experience is enriched with a range of activities designed to spark a lifelong interest in the field and to foster the students' individual career development. Active mentoring, collaboration, and monitoring of the student experience have been critical to achieving the programmatic goals. The Cellular Bioengineering Boot Camp has introduced Scholars to laboratory and imaging skills that facilitate their integration into their research labs. Exciting research projects that rely heavily on interdisciplinary collaboration introduce the Scholars to a broad array of topics grounded in Cellular Bioengineering. A new focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, with substantial industry involvement, parallels the recent NSF I-Corps initiative for translational research to capitalize on the potential for new technology that emanates from the research and provide an even broader impact of the program. Weekly seminars and discussion groups allow tracking and monitoring of the Scholars' experiences while concurrently engaging them in professional development. Incorporation of a mentoring workshop for the graduate students who serve as 'near-peer' mentors expands the impact of the program beyond the undergraduate participants.",
