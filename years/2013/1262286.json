This goal of this proposal is to develop an \"engineering quality\" description for the equilibrium properties and dynamics of long DNA molecules under extreme confinement in a nanochannel and to compare the predictions with experimental observations generated by BNG and its technology.\r\n\r\nThe success of this project can help the development of this new DNA mapping technology by providing a fundamental understanding of DNA confined in nanochannels. This is also an excellent academic-industrial partnership that can help the development of next-generation DNA sequencing and mapping technologies.",
