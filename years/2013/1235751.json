 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine acoustic telemetry has advanced our understanding of the behavioral ecology of marine organisms, but telemetry positional error and limits on the number of targets that can be tracked simultaneously limit the scale and scope of research. The PI requests funding to develop a Large-Area High-Resolution Marine Acoustic Tracking System. This project will develop a prototype of a new class of marine acoustic telemetry systems (including tags, receivers, and software) capable of tracking up to 500 targets simultaneously over a large area (>1km) and with sub-meter accuracy.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nThe key broader impact is the development of improved telemetry instrumentation and information for the scientific community. If the system does achieve the goals of the project it will be a valuable asset to researchers and the knowledge they generate from its use. This is important because acoustic telemetry is the future of fish movement studies and its application to evolutionary and ecology of marine fishes. The second target of broader impact is graduate and undergraduate training. All of the academic salaries requested are for a graduate student for 3 years and a shorter period of post-doc support. This will insure the engagement of a student in the project. Undergrads attending an associated course at FHL will also have opportunities to be involved in the project. Outreach is focused on the general public via outreach infrastructure at Friday Harbor Labs.",

Marine acoustic telemetry can provide a critical enabling technology for answering fundamental and applied scientific questions about the ecological processes affected by these changes. The answers to such questions will inform our understanding of society&rsquo;s impacts on valuable marine species, and this understanding can be used to support efforts to mitigate or manage them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our project provided significant training opportunities for two graduate students, Ian Brosnan and Louise McGarry, who both completed their doctoral degrees during the project and continued working on it as postdoctoral associates. It also provided training opportunities for a number of other graduate and undergraduate students participating in a long-running Office of Naval Research-supported Marine Bioacoustics class taught at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL). In addition, the project enabled unique research opportunities for several undergraduates who were supported by NSF Research Experience Undergraduate (REU) funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Improvements in the detection range and number of organisms that an acoustic telemetry system can track are critically important to the cost effectiveness and statistical power of impact assessment studies. In addition, increasingly accurate positioning will be required to answer important questions related to spatially explicit management approaches. For example, management approaches such as marine protected areas do not incorporate microhabitat features, defined as features at less than 1-meter scale. However, these features can influence the distribution, movement, and densities of many species, especially bottom-associated species such as rockfish, which are popular with sports fishers. Failing to include microhabitat features in modeling and planning for spatially explicit management approaches can lead to less accurate and precise population parameter estimates and more error-prone interpretations of movement behaviors, such as&nbsp; the spill-over of targeted species from protected areas into fishing grounds. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we embarked on an effort to develop a new marine acoustic tracking system. The project included the design, construction, deployment, and evaluation of a prototype system that would be capable of simultaneously tracking hundreds of individual tagged targets in three dimensions and providing centimeter-scale spatial resolution at ranges up to 1 kilometer. To provide a realistic evaluation, the system was used to perform ecological research related to the habitat use and movements of copper rockfish (<em>Sebastes caurinus</em>).</p>\n<p>The prototype system was deployed in the University of Washington&rsquo;s Marine Preserve, adjacent to the University&rsquo;s Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL). The FHL site provided relatively easy access to our private-sector partner&rsquo;s (Hydroacoustic Technology, Incorporated - HTI) engineering facilities in Seattle, WA, and also offered the opportunity to engage a variety of undergraduate and graduate students in the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The project encountered several logistical challenges. The most important of these challenges resulted from the study site&rsquo;s rugged bottom topography and the close association of copper rockfish with the bottom. By mounting our hydrophones near the seafloor, the rugged topography limited the number of direct-path detections of bottom-associated rockfish received on all four hydrophones. This limited the system&rsquo;s ability to localize and track these fish in three dimensions. A pre-deployment viewshed analysis had shown that simultaneous detections on all four hydrophones were possible in the study area. However, a second post-deployment analysis revealed that most of the tagged fish remained in positions so close to the bottom that the probability of simultaneous detection by all four hydrophones was low. In future deployments, this issue could be addressed in two ways. First, a viewshed analysis performed after tagging, but prior to final hydrophone deployment, could be used to validate the plan for hydrophone placement or demonstrate how it would need to be adjusted to improve the probability of simultaneous detections. Second, one or more additional surface-mounted hydrophones, or a full array deployed at the surface, would significantly increase the area where tagged fish would be detected by four or more hydrophones.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges encountered, the primary objective of the project was met - the prototype system was successfully designed, constructed, and deployed to detect and track tagged fish in a marine environment. A limited set of the data collected by the array were successfully analyzed to generate a three-dimensional home range estimate and to map changing day to night fish movement patterns. Additionally, an autonomous underwater vehicle carrying one of our acoustic tags several meters above the bottom was successfully localized and tracked continuously in three dimensions. Finally, based on lessons learned from the project, HTI has now produced a marine acoustic tracking system and series of tagsthat are commercially available to the scientific community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;H&nbsp;Greene</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235751/1235751_10244727_1499381670416_2015Fish6PositioningIMAGE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235751/1235751_10244727_1499381670416_2015Fish6PositioningIMAGE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Three-dimensional acoustic tracking of Copper rockfish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235751/1235751_10244727_1499381670416_2015Fish6PositioningIMAGE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Three-dimensional acoustic tracking of Copper rockfish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Left: Acoustic tracking of Copper rockfish at study site as seen from above, with hydrophones indicated in green, fish detections in red.
