 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAGER: Integrated Self-Calibrated Analog Front-End for Biopotential and Bioimpedance Measurements \r\n\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: This research addresses the need for enhancements of integrated analog circuits to permit reliable measurements of biosignals over prolonged time periods. The all-encompassing goals are to realize input impedance boosting and on-chip calibration in order to enable the use of dry electrodes as well as to alleviate the impact of manufacturing process variations of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication technologies. A prototype chip will be fabricated and tested to experimentally validate the proposed concepts while meeting or exceeding state-of-the-art performance specifications. The instrumentation amplifier in the system will be designed with a feedback loop that boosts the input impedance for measurements of biopotentials and bioimpedances with dry electrodes. Extra circuitry will also be developed to automatically optimize the suppression of undesired common-mode interference signals at the input. The auxiliary analog test signal generation circuits and digital calibration circuits will be integrated together on the same chip as the analog front-end system. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will give rise to circuit design methods that enable long-term brain signal acquisitions with dry electrodes interfaced to highly integrated chips. The results will improve systems for monitoring of brain signals during epilepsy diagnosis, drowsiness detection, and the recognition of intentions in order to allow an incapacitated patient to communicate or to control robots. Since the same type of instrumentation amplifier and similar analog front-end architectures are frequently found in measurement circuits for bioimpedances, the outcomes of this research will also be applicable to the design of integrated circuits for cancer and injury detection, movement sensing of body organs, and implantable pacemakers. Due to the reliability enhancement prospects with the proposed built-in testing and calibration techniques, the work can potentially provide a viable path for sustainable performance improvements of portable and implantable medical devices through the use of advanced fabrication technologies with high process variations. Knowledge obtained from this project will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate education, and it will be shared publicly to contribute to the advancement of design and test engineering methods in the semiconductor industry.",

Our research group developed a Self-Calibrated Analog Front-End for Long Acquisitions of Biosignals (SCAFELAB) system to realize an on-chip performance optimization approach that enables reliable biosignal measurements with low-power single-chip devices fabricated in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The main biosignal-sensing applications for the SCAFELAB system are electroencephalography (EEG) signal acquisitions involving voltage measurements down to a few microvolts. Due to rising demand in health monitoring applications, the development of dry-electrode measurement methodologies is a research challenge that calls for integrated analog front-ends with higher input impedance in addition to a good common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). Long-term brain signal monitoring applications will directly benefit from the proposed analog front-end circuit design approach. For example, the research results are applicable in systems for drowsiness detection, epilepsy diagnosis, and intent recognition to allow communication or to control objects/robots. Biopotentials are conventionally acquired using electrodes covered with electrolyte gels or solutions to decrease the contact impedance at the skin interface. However, such wet-contact measurements require time to prepare the skin surface. More importantly, they cause discomfort (or even allergic reactions) and dry out in long-term monitoring applications such as in brain-computer interfaces where EEG signals are acquired and analyzed over hours, days, or longer. In general, dry electrodes are better suited for monitoring over long time durations, but their use is associated with increased contact resistances. This characteristic complicates the measurement of small biopotentials by requiring very high input impedance at the analog front-end amplifier.
