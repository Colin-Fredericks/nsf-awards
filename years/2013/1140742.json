 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nExploring Science in the Studio is expanding a pedagogical approach that embeds science into courses in the fine arts, design, architecture, and creative writing.  The project is engaged in developing and disseminating new pedagogical approaches and non-lab based instructional materials to deliver science content to humanities students. The outputs will be specially-designed and produced mobile units for scientific exploration.  These mobile units will provide a replicable and scalable process for bringing science instructional materials directly into classrooms at colleges that do not have stand-alone science departments or facilities. This project has two goals: 1) To enable students in such colleges to understand the transferability of scientific methods of inquiry and knowledge to their practices in art, design, and writing; and 2) To help the humanities faculties in these colleges to integrate science into their teaching on the topic of sustainability.  Sustainability is the science focus because of its substantial breadth, and because problems arising from climate change and the need for increased sustainability in the use of natural resources will be increasingly addressed by teams of individuals who contribute not only scientific knowledge, but creativity and innovation. Artists and designers have important roles to play on such teams.",

The grant supported the participation of scientists in a total of eighteen classes through meaningful engagements and interactions with students and faculty. In some cases, the visiting scientists collaborated with the studio faculty in the development of course syllabi and activities. More often, the visiting scientists participated in the classes at several key points in the semester presenting scientific information relevant to the class and engaging with student questions and work.

The MUSE units expanded from a stand-alone cart to a system that incorporates carts, trays, kits, and soft storage (totes, backpacks) into a larger storage and display unit, housed in the CCA Libraries. The system evolved from our identification of several needs for the science materials (storage, access, and display) as well as several dichotomies in the nature of the intended materials: tiny/large, cheap/valuable, fragile/durable, light/heavy, mobile/stationary, field use/classroom use. The units are available to any CCA faculty member or student who attends training workshops on their use. The CCA library provides a permanent storage, display, and work site for the school&rsquo;s science materials, centralizing these resources in a location utilized by students and faculty from all of CCA&rsquo;s 21 undergraduate and 13 graduate majors. By increasing faculty and student access to scientific materials, equipment, and collections, the MUSE blurs the boundaries between the science classroom and the studio, inspired by the joy of discovery and wonder at the natural world.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>3.
