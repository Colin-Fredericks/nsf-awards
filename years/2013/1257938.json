 "awd_abstract_narration": "One little-publicized aspect of human-caused, global change has been a doubling of the availability of nitrogen to plants via the manufacture of fertilizer and the burning of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is the element that most strongly limits plant growth on land, so one ecological consequence is likely to be a rise in the total productivity of plants.  A more surprising and opposite consequence could be a fall in a major, natural source of nitrogen for plants, the association between species of plants in the Pea Family, known as legumes; and root-dwelling bacteria, known as rhizobia, which convert nitrogen gas in the air into ammonium, a form of nitrogen that plants use to make proteins and other molecules essential for life.  Legumes that can get more nitrogen directly from the soil tend less to associate with rhizobia, which demand carbohydrates from the plants.  Over time, global change in nitrogen is thus predicted to reduce the abundance of rhizobia and drive the evolution of less cooperative rhizobia that make less nitrogen available to the plants.  This could in turn increase reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and feedback upon the global nitrogen cycle.  This project will use an existing, 22-year-old experiment in nitrogen addition experiment at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station as a window onto what may happen to the natural nitrogen supply over the decades to come. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include applications to agriculture, research training for students, and promotion of diversity in the scientific workforce. A number of cropping systems, including the rotation of soybeans and corn, use the association between legumes and rhizobia as a source of nitrogen.  Inquiry-based labs for two large undergraduate courses will be based on the project and submitted for publication by Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology, a widely used resource for science educators. To promote equitability and diversity in the academic community, the project will create web-based materials and organize panel discussions that will guide undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through the process of applying to and succeeding in graduate school.",

These benefits are not static, however, but evolve through time depending on aspects of both the organisms and the environment - a process we are only beginning to understand. One mutualism with major impact in natural and agricultural systems is that between leguminous plants (peas, beans, soybeans) and nitrogen (N)-fixing soil rhizobia; because of these benefits exchanged, this symbiosis affects global N cycling. The availability of soil nutrients (particularly N) had been hypothesized to alter the evolution of these interactions to result in rhizobium partners that are less beneficial for their plant hosts, decreasing plant health and productivity. In this project, we made use of an important existing resource, a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, to test this key prediction by studying rhizobia from fields that were fertilized with N for 22 years and comparing those to rhizobia from control fields. We used a combination of field sampling, greenhouse experiments, and high-throughput genome sequencing to: 1) demonstrate that less-beneficial rhizobia evolved in response to long-term fertilization with N, 2) discover that fewer rhizobia inhabit fertilized soils, 3) uncover the genomic basis of the evolutionary response, 4) implicate horizontal gene transfer of the symbiosis gene region in the decline of rhizobium quality, 5) show that these evolutionary changes in the bacteria feed back to the larger community and ecosystem by altering soil N availability for all other plants. We have also answered several addition questions including: 1) how do evolutionary changes in belowground rhizobium populations influence aboveground herbivores and pollinators, 2) how do evolutionary changes in rhizobia influence decomposition and what is the relative magnitude of ecological (N-fertilization) vs. evolutionary (reduced rhizobium cooperation) effects on decomposition, 3) how does nitrogen alter natural selection on rhizobium cooperation, and 4) how does rhizobium diversity influence plant growth response. In sum, our results show that soil nutrient availability and the environment more generally can alter the trajectory of mutualism evolution in such a way that can impact the exchange of mutualism benefits and thus the contributions of mutualisms to ecosystem services, particularly for bacterial species that can evolve quite quickly via horizontal transmission. Moreover our results show that these microevolutionary changes can feed back on herbivores, the plant community, and ecosystem-level processes (including soil N and decomposition) and thus have impacts far beyond the scope of the two species in a particular symbiosis. Our work has been highlighted in the press (Science Daily, Michigan NPR, the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette).</p>\n<p>As part of our project, we have trained numerous undergraduates from University of Illinois, Michigan State, and St. Ambrose University.
