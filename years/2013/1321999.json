 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\n\r\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is creating a new I-Corps Site that will build upon their existing expertise, while filling a gap that is critical in the commercialization and translation of university-based research. This I-Corps Site will enable Illinois to broaden its innovation services, update current entrepreneurial programming and reach additional prospective and under-represented participants to create a robust and diversified pipeline of entrepreneurial teams to enroll in the NSF I-Corps program. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of these activities include a wider network of students and faculty involved with technology development and commercialization efforts. Students will be exposed to technology entrepreneurship efforts as Entrepreneurial Leads, contributors, and by attending targeted entrepreneurship curriculum. Faculty entrepreneurship will be enhanced through team formation, business guidance, and financial support. Under-represented groups will be especially encouraged to participate in I-Corps Site and technology commercialization activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Illinois I-Corps Site wrapped up four years of programming and completed 16 cohorts on campus and 2 regional sector-specific cohorts with partnering universities.  The intellectual merit for the project includes the further development and expansion of the practice of entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization of university research on campus.  Through the work of this grant, courses were created on campus that include the I-Corps methodology of evidence-based entrepreneurship, grad students, and faculty were educated, and over 120 teams participated in I-Corps @ Illinois programming.\n\nThe Illinois I-Corps Site had a broad impact, not only on campus but across the country.  On campus, the I-Corps activities led to a wide network work of students and faculty engaged with technology commercialization activities.  After year one, the I-Corps programs were integrated into the campus entrepreneurial ecosystem.  For instance, teams participating in the Research Park I-Start program were directed to first apply to I-Corps @ Illinois.  Teams that won the campus new venture competition went on to participation in I-Corps.  The Office of Technology Management directs new faculty members to I-Corps.  Nationally, in year two the results of the Illinois I-Corps program at recruiting underrepresented teams led to the creation of the AWARE program (Accelerating Women And underRepresented Entrepreneurs), which is now an NSF-funded program that now has sites across the country.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jed Taylor"
