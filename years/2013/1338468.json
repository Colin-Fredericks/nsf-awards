 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have identified molecular genetic techniques to identify cryptic lineages of invasive aquatic plants - lineages that cannot be easily distinguished using traditional visual identification. These lineages frequently differ in traits that are relevant to their management, such as how they respond to herbicides. In particular, some lineages are herbicide resistant, which is an important emerging issue in aquatic ecosystem management.\r\n\r\nA major challenge for the successful and economically efficient management of invasive aquatic plant species is the ability to accurately determine which lineage(s) are present in a lake or pond before prescribing a specific management activity. For example, it is critical to distinguish invasive lineages from native species because native species are not typically permitted for management activities. Similarly, it is desirable to predict response to herbicides before they are applied, as herbicide failures have adverse economic and environmental effects. Thus, there is immediate need to translate basic research into commercial risk assessment tools that will provide knowledge-based management strategies for individual lakes.",
