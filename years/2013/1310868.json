 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applied Inverse Problems 2013 (AIP 2013) Conference, Daejeon, Korea, July 1-5, 2013. The series of AIP Conferences aim to provide a primary international forum for academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of Inverse Problems (IP). IP are problems where causes for a desired or an observed effect are to be determined. They lie at the heart of scientific inquiry and technological development. The enormous increase in computing power and the development of powerful algorithms has made it possible to apply the techniques of IP to real-world problems of growing complexity. Applications include a number of medical as well as other imaging techniques, location of oil and mineral deposits in the earth's substructure, creation of astrophysical images from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape optimization, model identification in growth processes and modelling in the life sciences. This is the first time that these series of conferences will be held in Asia. One aim of the conference is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians and practitioners of inverse problems. Another goal is to foster international cooperation between scientists working on inverse problems throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe series of AIP Conferences aim to provide a primary international forum for academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of inverse problems (IP), such as mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods, computational approaches, numerical algorithms etc. This series of conferences started in Montecatini, Italy in 2001 and has been held every two years since in Europe and North America: Lake Arrowhead, California, in 2003, Cirecester, UK, in 2005, Vancouver, Canada, in 2007, Vienna, Austria, in 2009 and College Station, Texas, in 2011. This is the first time that the AIP conference will be held in Asia. The series of conferences have turned to be the most recognized in the field of IP with more than 300 participants in 2007, 2009 and 2011 and we expect the same in 2013. Since 2007 they are organized by the Inverse Problem International Association (IPIA). The invited speakers and the minisymposia of AIP 2013 will cover a broad spectrum of the applications of inverse problems, focusing on recent developments in medical imaging, determination of defects in materials, homogeneization and inverse problems, geometric inverse problems, remote sensing, industrial applications, numerical and regularization methods in inverse problems, and also, invisibility and cloaking. One aim of the conference is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians and practitioners of inverse problems. Another goal is to foster international cooperation between scientists working on inverse problems throughout the world.",
