 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of knowing the different sources of atmospheric nitrate to the polar ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, along with their transport paths, is of intrinsic interest to the atmospheric chemistry of polar NOx species. In turn, surface photolysis of snowpack nitrate renders these ice sheets as strongly oxidizing surfaces during sunlight.  Attempts to derive past conditions or variability of atmospheric NOx (= NO + NO2 +?) species from ice core records will need to take photodenitrification and source transfer function effects into account.  \r\n\r\nThe approach willcontinue to use a inverse chemical transfer model (adjoint GEOS-Chem) to test the sensitivity of nitrate deposition to the Antarctic continent from various possible sources. The following questions are posed: 1) what are the important sources of nitrate to Antarctia (and Greenland) in the present and in the pre-industrial Holocene? 2) How does the recycling of reactive nitrogen at the atmosphere-snow interface redistribute nitrate across large polar ice sheets? and  3) are their implications for nitrate preservation in ice cores and their interpretation?\r\n\r\nGoals being pursued in this modeling study include the reconstruction of past (polar) atmospheric composition and a better contemporary understanding of the variability of atmospheric reactive nitrogen compounds as may be discerned from measurements of nitrate concentrations retained in snow, firn and possibly ice cores in polar regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe abundance of reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere strongly impacts its oxidizing capacity, and hence the lifetime of most reduced trace gases such as methane.  Natural sources of reactive nitrogen include lightning, soil microbes, and biomass burning.  Reactive nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere primarily through chemical reactions that result in the formation of nitrate, which is removed from the atmosphere through deposition to the surface of the Earth.  Deposition of nitrate to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets was thus thought to provide a record of the abundance of reactive nitrogen in past atmospheres.  However, nitrate in snow can be broken apart by sunlight, converting it back into reactive nitrogen.  This snow source of reactive nitrogen is emitted back to the atmosphere, recycling reactive nitrogen back to the atmosphere and effectively increasing its lifetime.  This has implications for the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in snow-covered regions and for the interpretation of ice-core records of nitrate concentrations.\n\nThis research project calculated the flux of reactive nitrogen from snowpack in Greenland, Antarctica, and a mid-latitude location (Utah) for the first time using a suite of models.  We found the flux of snow-sourced reactive nitrogen is similar in all three locations, despite very different concentrations of snow nitrate.  Changes in snow nitrate concentrations between each location were compensated by changes in impurities in the snow that absorb sunlight and thus lower the rate at which snow nitrate is broken apart by sunlight.  The flux of snow-source reactive nitrogen in Utah is small compared to anthropogenic sources, but is a dominant source of reactive nitrogen in Antarctica and Greenland due to their remote locations.  Wind-patterns in Greenland and Antarctica redistribute snow-source reactive nitrogen across the landmass, resulting in loss of snow nitrate in regions of wind divergence, and gain of nitrate in regions of wind convergence.  The loss of snow nitrate is greater in Antarctica compared to Greenland due to lower snow accumulation rates in Antarctica that bury nitrate beneath the snow photic zone.  The spatial distribution of the nitrogen isotopes of snow nitrate is mainly governed by the amount of sunlight-driven loss, so that combined ice-core records of nitrate concentrations and its nitrogen isotopic composition can be used to estimate reactive nitrogen concentrations in past atmospheres.\n\nThis research has informed the interpretation of ice-core records of nitrate and its isotopes, and has been used to estimate changes in the reactive nitrogen abundance in past atmospheres during the last glacial period from a Greenland ice-core record.  This has improved our understanding of how the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere responds to changes in climate.  Estimates of the flux of snow-sourced reactive nitrogen from mid-latitude snow will improve air quality models that are used to determine the most effective strategy for reducing concentrations of the pollutant ground-level ozone in regions of oil and gas extraction in the western US in wintertime.  This project provided training for two graduate student and one undergraduate student.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Becky Alexander"
