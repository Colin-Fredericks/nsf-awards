Over the past 50 years, mathematical and theoretical models have improved our understanding of some of the mechanisms favoring the origins of social behavior; however, we still lack a clear understanding of the genetic and physiological processes underlying variation in social behavior. This research uses halictid bees to study the molecular and environmental processes that can lead to changes in social structure within and between species. Halictids are an excellent model system for these types of questions because, unlike honey or bumble bees (which are all highly social), halictids encompass both solitary and social species.  This work focuses on a single species (Lasioglossum albipes) with remarkable variation in sociality: bees from different populations are either solitary or social.  This project harnesses this variation to study the mechanisms underlying changes in social behavior, and combines methods from genomics and ecology to identify some of the key genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying changes in social structure in this species.  Comparisons with other species will be made to determine whether the same factors underlying variation within L. albipes also underlie variation in social behavior across bees in general. When completed, this work will provide an in-depth assessment of some of the key genetic and environmental components underlying social behavior.  The integrative nature of this work creates an effective platform for education and outreach, including: (1) a collaboration with the Harvard Museum of Natural History to produce a presentation on social insects for museum visitors, (2) online teaching materials with activities on behavioral biology that can be incorporated in classrooms, (3) creation of a professional development program on animal social behavior for museum staff and (4) training of undergraduate and graduate students.",
