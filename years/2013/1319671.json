 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the VeriQ project is to develop techniques for the formal\r\nverification of quantitative properties of software.  Every program\r\nrequires a certain amount of resources such as memory, power, and\r\nprocessor cycles to perform its task.  A proof that the resources\r\nprovided by the hardware of the system are sufficient to safely\r\nexecute a program should be the first step in the verification of that\r\nprogram.  In addition to the verification of such resource-usage\r\nbounds, there are a vast number of domain-specific quantitative\r\nproperties that are crucial for the correctness of software.  Finally,\r\nreasoning about quantities can simplify the verification of\r\nnon-quantitative properties such as termination.  By advancing the\r\nstate-of-the art in quantitative verification, VeriQ facilitates the\r\ndevelopment of reliable, efficient and predictable software systems.\r\n\r\nThe investigators focus on three technical goals that are among the\r\nmost important problems in the field of quantitative verification.\r\nFirst, they develop an automatic and compositional resource analysis\r\nfor programs that are written in high-level languages with garbage\r\ncollection, side effects, and higher-order functions.  Second, they\r\napply the techniques from resource analysis for high-level languages\r\nto simplify the reasoning about quantitative properties of realistic\r\nsystem code with concurrent execution and advanced control flow.\r\nThird, they investigate the relationship between quantitative\r\nproperties and liveness properties with the goal of utilizing\r\nquantitative reasoning techniques in correctness proofs of software\r\nverification.",
