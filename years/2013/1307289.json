 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays are produced and accelerated in the most violent environments of our Universe and can have energies that are orders of magnitude larger than the energies produced by the Earth's most powerful accelerators.  Teraelectronvolt (TeV) gamma rays can be used to probe the possible sources of cosmic ray acceleration since they are produced in the interactions of cosmic rays with matter and radiation fields, and as neutral particles they can be traced back to their origin.  The sensitivity and angular resolution of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes make these devices particularly well suited for point source and morphological studies, while the wide field of view and large duty cycle of extensive air shower arrays are advantageous for detecting diffuse gamma radiation from large areas in the sky. The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is currently being constructed at the Sierra Negra Plateau, Mexico, and is expected to have a point source sensitivity that is improved by a factor of 10 to 15 over that of previous extensive air shower instruments. \r\n\r\nThe Michigan Technological University group will play a leading role in the collection and analysis of the scientific data of the experiment. Their research focus will be on the study of diffuse and extended very high-energy emission at large scales, which is now possible with unprecedented sensitivity due to the improved performance of HAWC. The group is also responsible for detector calibration and will therefore play a critical role in the HAWC construction and operation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The participating students and post-doctoral scientist will receive scientific and educational training in the analysis of large data sets as well as the operation of a complex instrument within the context of a large international collaboration. The outreach component of this project is designed to generate greater community interest in physics through the installation of detector components in a local mine that is open to guided tours.  This will expose teachers to modern experimental physics at the very-high energy frontier. The results of the outreach component of the proposed project will be disseminated by publications and conferences presentations.",

While millions of stars are visible in the night sky, only about a couple of hundred objects have been found to emit gamma rays at these highest photon energies (&gt;1 TeV). The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located at about 13,450 feet altitude just below Pico de Orizaba, Mexico's highest mountain, is the currently most sensitive survey instrument in the world able to detect gamma rays of up to 100 TeV, which originate from astrophysical source such as supernova remnants, binary systems, and active galactic nuclei.

A first survey of parts of the Milky Way accomplished with the partially completed observatory published in 2015 uncovered TeV emission from ten locations by applying a likelihood ratio test to the gamma-ray data (see first image).

Most of the models explaining the Fermi Bubbles revolve around the idea of outflows from the galactic center which then interact with the interstellar medium.

A search for very high energy emission from the Northern Fermi Bubble region using data collected with HAWC between 2014 and 2016 did not reveal significant gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV.
