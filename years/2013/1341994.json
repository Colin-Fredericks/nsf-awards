All other costs associated with student attendance will be covered by other sponsors.    The goal of the symposium is to bring together top software engineering researchers and students to discuss a broad range of software engineering research topics, to consider future visions for the future of software engineering, and to inspire graduate and undergraduate students to work on the identified challenges.  Participants will include senior researchers from both academia and industry, as well as up to one hundred students. The  broader impacts are educational and will help build the next generation of researchers in Software Engineering.",
