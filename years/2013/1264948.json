The proposed architecture overcomes both the limitations of previously demonstrated implantable systems, as well as the challenges (environmental stability and device cross-coupling) traditionally associated with thin film systems. They will build a series of blood flow monitors using flexible organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodetectors (OPDs) to map both oxygenation and total hemoglobin in the brain, increasing in size, scale, and complexity as the program progresses. They will demonstrate the functionality and stability of the systems using both simulated condition testing and implanted devices. This platform applies OLED technology, which has had a significant impact in displays, to build a transformative light source for biological research that is capable of implantation in nearly any configuration and can be used to image reflectance and fluorescence over large areas for extended periods of time. This thin, flexible platform can bring this new perspective and capability to a broad class of imaging, optogenetic, fluorescence measurement, and other biophotonic applications.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the IDBR program (Instrument Development for Biological Research) in the BIO Directorate, and Biophotonics program in the Engineering Directorate.",
