 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will conduct theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study the inner solar system orbital dynamics that were affected by giant planet migration during the early solar system. The PI and her team will investigate the non-uniform distribution of the angular orbital elements of Near-Earth-Objects (NEOs), calculate the secular dynamics of the inner solar system with different orbital architectures, carry out numerical simulations of the stability of such architectures under the effects of giant planet migration, and calculate the loss rates from the pre-LHB asteroid reservoirs and estimates of the flux of large impacts on the planets.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include applications to extrasolar planetary systems, debris disks and the Earth's climate history. This works has implications for the formation and development of the early solar system, is relevant to understanding the population of NEOs, some of which may be hazardous to Earth, and to modeling the planetary systems around other stars.  The work will be involved in a Ph.D. dissertation and the PI will produce a slide presentation on this work for public audiences, made available for free.",
