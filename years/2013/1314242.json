 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pursue the development of unitary qubit lattice algorithms (QULA) to solve problems in nonlinear physics by extending ideas used in lattice Boltzmann and lattice gas algorithms. QULA for scalar 2D and 3D Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) have already provided new information on the unexpected behavior of continuum Hamiltonians. The major thrust of this project will be to examine energy spectral cascades in spinor-BEC quantum turbulence where the flow involves both Abelian and non-Abelian vortices.  Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics. This research is also expected to have a profound impact on plasma and space physics applications, as QULA will allow for the study of magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence and magnetic reconnection. The QULA algorithms are manifestly unitary and can be readily encoded onto future quantum computers.\r\n\r\nThe broad impacts of this project include the training of the workforce of the future, with graduate and undergraduate students having the opportunity to learn and work in an important field of scientific inquiry. Students will acquire hands-on experience on the use of high-performance computational platforms, as QULA scale ideally on modern supercomputers and the scaling was tested up to several hundreds of thousands of cores.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs the classical ?0? and ?1? bits are the building blocks for conventional current supercomputers, so are the so-called qubits the building blocks of quantum computers.  A qubit is a state represented by a position vector on the surface of a unit sphere.  The entanglement of several qubits at a given lattice site and its propagation throughout the lattice can lead, in certain problems, to an exponential speed up over that from manipulating classical bits.  We have been investigating the time-reversible manipulations of these qubits through unitary local collisions and shifts throughout a regular spatial lattice for a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BECs) described by a set of 3 coupled nonlinear equations commonly called the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations.  In particular we are interested in how the vortex soliton solutions reconnect, leading in some cases to quantum turbulence ? a state of many entangled quantum vortices forming spaghetti-like patterns.  One of the chief difficulties in quantum computations is the accuracy to which one can evaluate the exponential of the total Hamiltonian for the system.   In spin-1 there is the kinetic energy operator, the s-wave nonlinear Bosonic interaction and the spin-interaction term.  Since the s-wave interaction cannot be summed to all orders, one must resort to perturbative techniques.  Starting from analytically determined straight line vortex solitons we follow their evolution for the coupled spin-1 BEC, seeing interesting vortex reconnection patterns (Figs. 1a &amp; 2a for ms=-1, and Figs. 1b &amp; 2b for ms=0).\n\nWe have also considered the summation to all orders of the kinetic energy operator by using non-local unitary Fourier transforms. For 1D systems this has permitted us to examine soliton speeds over 25 greater than can be run stably with our usual collide-stream qubit operator sequence. \n\nWe have also considered the qubit representation of a nonlinear optics group to construct stable 3D soliton structures using a focusing-defocusing approach to the kinetic energy operator (instead of looking just at the sign of the s-wave Bosonic interaction).  The required changes in the qubit collision operator have been found and unitary qubit simulations show good agreement with those determined by somewhat sophisticated direct computational techniques from this nonlinear optics group.\n\n \n\nA highly parallelizeable cousin to the qubit unitary lattice algorithm is the lattice Boltzmann (LB) technique.  In LB the collision operator is non-unitary.  However like in the qubit approach, LB is a mesoscopic representation with the required physical problem being recovered by taking suitable averages (?moments?).  To study MHD turbulence one has to resort either to filtering out the wavelengths that are too short to be resolved by the computational grid.  This introduces a non-closed set of equations.  It is found that if one first filters the LB equations appropriate for recovering MHD and then performs the standard averaging to recover the fluid equations one comes to a self-consistent closed set of equations under the physical constraint that the filtered Reynolds stresses affect the dynamics at the transport time scale.  This extends an earlier calculation of Karlin et. al. for Navier-Stokes turbulence. \n\nAnother important idea from the Karlin group is the entropic stabilization of LB for Navier-Stokes turbulence.  The standard LB algorithm does not enforce the positive definiteness of the distribution functions. While a discrete H-theorem has been derived some time ago we have found it to be computationally expensive for MHD studies (i.e., in performing Newton-Raphson iterations are every spatial grid and at every time step).   The Karlin group has recently developed an accurate analytic representation to determine this entropic stabilizing function.  We have now extended these ideas to MHD turbulence.  However only a partial entropic stabilization can be introduced if one requires that the magnetic field be recovered from the zeroth moment of the magnetic vector distribution.  This is because positive definiteness cannot be enforced on the magnetic distributions since now we desire magnetic field reversal for magnetic reconnection.  However we find some secondary stabilization effects emplaced on the magnetic distributions since the magnetic field is now present in the stabilized velocity momentum equation.  One sees the effect of this stabilization for the case of  a Kelvin-Helmholtz jet in a weak non-stabilizing magnetic field.  The simulations yield the break up of the vortex sheets and the 2D-like fluid dynamics of vortex reconnection to form larger and larger vortices.  But one also finds streaks of vorticity due to the present of the weak magnetic field whose presence will eventually force the energy to cascade to smaller and smaller length scales (Fig. 3).  The distinctive regions in which the entropy stabilization function plays a vital role in the LB simulation is readily seen from its deviation from its value for non-entropic LB.  As expected, the entropy stabilization is most active in regions twhere the 2D MHD turbulence generate small scales ? i.e.,  in the streak regions of vorticity (Fig. 4)\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George M Vahala"
