 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the role of low-level atmospheric moisture in the development of convective clouds associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  The MJO is an envelope of organized convection that propagates from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and constitutes the dominant form of intraseasonal precipitation variability in the tropics, and also has important consequences for US weather.  The present work is a follow-on to the Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign, which took place in the equatorial Indian Ocean in 2011-2012 and involved the deployment of radars and other observing assets on Gan Island in the Maldives.  One hypothesis of the campaign, also pursued in this project, is that the deep, organized convective clouds associated with MJO initiation develop only when the atmospheric boundary layer, which contains most of the moisture in the atmospheric column, becomes sufficiently deep over a sufficiently large region.  The primary task of the present work is to generate humidity datasets using radar and scanning radiometer data collected as part of the campaign, through techniques involving 1) the Bragg scattering of S-band radar signals in cloud-free air; and 2) a combination of radiometer data and the differential attenuation of radar returns from clouds at two wavelengths (S- and Ka-band in this case).  The analysis of these humidity products will be complemented by numerical experiments carried out with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader scientific impacts due to the value new techniques for determining humidity, particularly techniques that can be applied in future field campaigns, as well as the value of the new humidity datasets for the research community.  In addition, the work seeks a better understanding of the initiation of MJO, which would be of societal value to the extent that it results in better predictions of the MJO and its downstream consequences.  In addition, the work has an educational component, including the use of the datasets in classroom teaching and the support of two graduate students.",

At short time scales, whether rapid  shallow-to-deep convective transitions effect MJO initiation and phase  transition, or simply reflect dynamically-induced moisture convergence,  is still open to debate. We have addressed this question with both an  observational and a modeling component. To briefly summarize, we have learned that  convection is more impervious to the environmental moisture distribution  within convectively-suppressed conditions when it is slightly more  organized. We have  learned that cold pools are indeed more effective at broadening the  convective spectrum within more convectively-suppressed environments in  the tropics, when they are effective at imposing more organization. In contrast, tropical convection that is organized at the largest scales, contains many cold pools but they are embedded within large systems for which they are primarily passive complements. An assessment of the contribution of  downdrafts to the moist static energy budget of the boundary layer,  relative to surface fluxes and entrainment, was also undertaken, using  datasets from the Research Vessel the Roger Revelle. The tropical boundary layer is not saturated with moisture, but consensus is still lacking on which process dries the boundary layer (entrainment of gently-subsiding air from above, or the more dynamic convective downdrafts). We have also learned from simulations that the  cloud-resolving simulations at one km grid spacing have&nbsp; difficulty reproducing the observed  near-surface moisture variability, with the simulations being too moist. This model  behavior is also evident in previously-published modeling studies, and  suggests to us that at least some, if weak, dynamical forcing is important for convective  initiation, i.e., a water vapor enhancement is not enough. Model  experimentation does not reveal much improvement with smaller model grid  spacings and suggests to us that the popular Morrison microphysical  scheme applied within the simulations is adequate.  Based on this, the most recent assessment suggests more emphasis be  placed on the contributing model parameterizations for down/up drafts.  From the observational side, we have also examined the ability of a  standard microwave radiometer to vertically profile the tropical  atmosphere moisture, towards examining if these can usefully augment  radiosonde networks. The latter has contributed to  the PhD training of Jianhao Zhang. Arun Chandra was a postdoctoral  research associate who received further training through this grant,  with both Jianhao and Arun receiving opportunities to attend  professional meetings and mentorship leading to first-authored  publications.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paquita&nbsp;Zuidema</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321891/1321891_10268984_1535560605220_Fig12--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321891/1321891_10268984_1535560605220_Fig12--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A comparison of observed (left) and modeled (right) cold pool composite behavior.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321891/1321891_10268984_1535560605220_Fig12--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A comparison of observed (left) and modeled (right) cold pool composite behavior.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Note in particular the differing surface moisture changes - the red lines in the top two rows.
