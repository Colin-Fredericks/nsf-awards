 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seasonal floods maintain the biological productivity and diversity of floodplain-river ecosystems, but the effect of infrequent, great floods on these ecosystems are less well known. Knowing the effect of this type of flood is critical where river ecosystems have been developed and where floodplains are now being restored because there are likely trade-offs between using restored floodplains to maintain native species and natural functions and using them to reduce threats to lives and property. The record flood of April 2013 on the Illinois River flooded two floodplain restoration projects undertaken by The Nature Conservancy; neither project had received river water prior to 2013. There were two contrasting flood regimes: 1) at the Merwin site, the levee breached resulting in a sudden and sustained influx of river water.  This flood pattern typifies what happens during intentional breaching to reduce a flood crest; 2) at Emiquon, the levee held but river water flowed into the site inoculating the area with nutrients and organisms.  The pattern at Emiquon typifies a seasonal flood or a flood managed to optimize species recovery and natural functions.  At both sites, rapid responses will be measured in nutrient and sediment concentrations, sediment denitrification, and change in algal biomass, bacterial communities and zooplankton production.  Longer-term responses of vegetation, fish, and water birds will be determined by comparing post flood 2013 data to existing long-term data sets.  \r\n\r\nResults from this project, including both short and long-term data sets and analyses, will assist floodplain managers and policymakers. This project will support the dissertation research of three graduate students and provide research experiences for three undergraduate students in river ecology.  Lessons learned will be shared with the public and government and private organizations through publications and field-based lectures/workshops for students and visiting groups through established programs at three river field stations.",

Finally, the results (described below) will inform The Nature Conservancy's management of both sites, including their implementation of a controlled connection between Emiquon and the Illinois River.\n\nResults &ndash; The ecological effects of flooding on previously regulated and protected floodplain restorations depend upon the degree of flooding.  In the case of Thompson Lake at Emiquon (restoration initiated in 2007), the levee was overtopped in 2013 and water input from the river resulted in about a 23% increase of the lake volume.  The influx of nutrients was quickly absorbed by the ecosystem, and the organisms that were transported were assimilated to the system.  Minor ecological changes occurred due to the flood of record and a continued restoration trajectory.  \n\nThe flood impact was much greater at the Merwin Preserve (restoration initiated in 1999) where the levee that separated the Illinois River from the Preserve failed.   Flooding was followed by a near-complete drawdown in late summer 2013.  We found that while flooding has historically been a natuural disturbance that is part of the system, flooding under present river conditions can drastically alter restoration plans for establishing a stable system with high biodiversity.  It appears, from this short-term study, that an uncontrolled connection of a floodplain lake to the Illinois River, such as now exists at Merwin ..."
