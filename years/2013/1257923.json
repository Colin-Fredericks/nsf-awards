 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's central hypothesis is that brain networks may be much more flexible than generally appreciated, perhaps to the point of altering their functional organization moment-to-moment to optimize stimulus processing.  This hypothesis will be tested by using fast voltage sensitive dyes to image the firing activity of networks of over 100 neurons in two different molluscan species as they respond to sensory input, generate behavioral motor programs, and store memory.  State-of-the-art analysis methods will be applied to track all recorded neurons as they shift allegiances among network communities in real time.  The project will have three areas of scientific and broader impacts.  First, the anticipated findings will significantly extend our current understanding of how brain networks are affected by the very information that they process.  Second, the recording and analysis tools being developed by this project will be of great use to many other laboratories.  Finally, the  broader impacts of this project are designed to inspire and educate future scientists, both undergraduate biology majors from neighboring 4 year colleges, as well as high school students from two predominantly Hispanic Waukegan-area high schools.  These educational outreach activities aim to increase the excitement and satisfaction of underrepresented individuals for careers in scientific research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHere are some highlights from our 4-year NSF project \"Stimulus-induced Neural Networks\":  \n\nDiscovery of a novel network-level memory mechanism.  Research on memory storage mechanisms has long been focused on how individual synapses change in strength with experience.  With the field?s emerging ability to record the firing of populations of individual neurons during learning, we are at last gaining the ability to see how distributed synaptic plasticity works to affect network function &ndash; essentially allowing us to watch memories install themselves in functioning neural networks.  Using this approach in the marine mollusk Tritonia we discovered a novel network-level mechanism of memory storage, involving the recruitment of previously unsuspected, \"pre-positioned\" but variably-participating neurons into memory networks. This represents a new perspective not just for memory formation, but for mechanisms by which network may rapidly tune their properties to optimize function in the face of changing environments.   \n\nHill, E.S., Vasireddi, S.K., Wang, J., Bruno, A.M., and Frost, W.N.

In humans, amphetamine (AMPH) and related psychostimulants taken in large or repeated doses can induce hallucinations.  Here we present evidence for such phenomena in the marine mollusk Tritonia.  Animals injected with AMPH were found to sporadically launch spontaneous escape swims in the absence of eliciting stimuli.  Deafferented isolated brains exposed to AMPH, where real stimuli could play no role, generated sporadic, spontaneous swim motor programs.  A neurophysiological search of the swim network traced the origin of these drug-induced spontaneous motor programs to spontaneous bursts of firing in the S-cells, the CNS afferent neurons that normally inform the animal of skin contact with its predators and trigger the animal?s escape swim.  Further investigation identified AMPH-induced enhanced excitability and plateau potential properties in the S-cells.  Taken together, these observations support an argument that Tritonia?s spontaneous AMPH-induced swims are triggered by false perceptions of predator contact &ndash; i.e., hallucinations&mdash;and illuminate potential cellular trigger mechanisms for such phenomena. \n\nLee, A.H., Brandon, C.L., Wang, J.W. and Frost, W.N.

In Press (June, 2018).\n\n \n\nDevelopment and application of new methodology for deconstructing large scale recordings of neural networks.  We published new methods for deconstructing neural networks into their constituent functional ensembles.  This included a new unsupervised consensus clustering technique, and a novel method for detecting common ensemble types across preparations, a previously unsolved but important problem in network analysis.  Our automated analysis, performed in unsupervised fashion on data obtained from multiple preparations, facilitates a new era of studies of topics such as the effects of development, learning, modulation, disease and drug effects on network functional structure.  It should also be equally adept at identifying common ensemble types across species.\n\nBruno, A.M., Frost, W.N. and Humphries, M.D. (2015).

Biol. 859: 127-145.\n\n \n\nDiscovery of a spiral attractor underlying the Aplysia locomotion motor program, illustrating the potential to use dimensionality reduction to study memory at the whole-network level.  The increasing availability of large scale recordings of brain networks at single neuron resolution provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover the principles by which information is organized in neural populations.  However, such data sets come with a new challenge&mdash;the collective activity of large neural populations is both complex and high dimensional.  Population recordings have as many dimensions as neurons, and each neuron can have a complex activity pattern.  What strategies can we use to expose the putative principles operating beneath the surface of real-world brain activity?  One route is dimension reduction, which focuses on identifying the components of activity that co-vary across the members of a neural population, shifting the focus from the high dimensional recorded data to a lower-dimensional representation of the overall population.  Implicit in this approach is the hypothesis that the high-dimensional population activity being recorded, although highly heterogeneous, is derived from a simpler, more consistent low-dimensional system.  We applied this approach, involving the development of novel analytic methods, to the Aplysia pedal ganglion locomotion network, and demonstrated that beneath the complex population activity lies an attractor, which turns out to be spiral in shape when mapped in low dimensional PCA space.\n\nBruno, A.M., Frost, W.N. and Humphries, M.D.  (2017).
