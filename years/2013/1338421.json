In other words, the intent is to rapidly screen for dopants in ceria that\r\ncan significantly enhance the water-gas shift reaction (WGS: CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\n\r\nWGS is an integral unit operation in industrial chemical processes to manufacture ammonia,\r\nmethanol, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The reaction is slightly exothermic (enthalpy of reaction\r\n= -41.1 kJ/mol) and the equilibrium favors product formation at low temperature. However,\r\nthe kinetics on typical catalysts are slow at low temperature. The currently employed Cu-based\r\nceria-supported WGS catalysts are cheap. However, they have a number of disadvantages in terms\r\nof operation, stability and propensity for deactivation due to S and Cl. As a result, rigorous\r\n(and expensive) operator training has become inevitable to prolong the life of the commercial\r\nWGS catalysts. In contrast, the relatively expensive noble metal catalysts, such as Pt, Pd,\r\nRh, Ru, have high intrinsic activity. High cost has hindered their implementation in industrial-scale\r\nWGS processes.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to identify many more promising WGS catalyst systems,\r\nthe PI will use first principles density functional theory (DFT), performed in a \"high-throughput\"\r\nmanner to allow him to rapidly consider an array of metallic dopant elements in ceria\r\nspanning the Periotic Table (45 in all, including K-As, Rb-Sb, and Cs-Bi). This is the first\r\nstep in a hierarchy of screening procedures before a detailed assessment can be made on a few selected cases.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\n\r\nAside from enhancing the fundamental understanding of WGS, the project will provide a knowledge base\r\nto tackle complex chemistry interactions that could lead to breakthroughs in optimum catalyst\r\ndevelopment, even for well-established and well-known chemical processes. In the long-term,\r\nthis investigation could aid in the fundamental understanding of informatics-based rational\r\ncatalyst design for enhanced stability and performance.\r\n\r\nIndustrial experience of the PI will enhance the engineering education of students and will\r\naid in broadening student exposure beyond the academic environment. The PI will integrate\r\nquantum mechanical modeling techniques, and their applications in catalysis, into multiple courses.",
