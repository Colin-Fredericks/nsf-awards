 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to elucidate the fundamental limiting mechanisms of charge and heat transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are quasi-1-dimensional (1D) devices obtained from 2D graphene. The combined experimental and theoretical approach of the PIs will study the influence of width, substrate, edge roughness and decoration on the electronic and thermal properties of GNRs over a wide range of temperatures and applied electric fields. \r\n\tThe intellectual merit lies in revealing the fundamental limitations of current and heat flow in GNRs, which could be used to implement both transistors and interconnects and have a trans-formative effect on modern electronics. This project will span from nanomaterials and devices to comprehensive microscopic simulation to guide and interpret the experiments. Tuning of width and control of the edge roughness or functionalization achieved in this program would open new vistas for the manipulation of electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric response of GNRs. The fundamental knowledge resulting from this work would apply to other quasi-1D systems where variability, edge roughness, and substrate effects become important. \r\n\tThe broader impacts include (1) the creation of a broad educational environment for gradu-ate students through the experimental-theoretical nature of the project, (2) student exchanges and regular visits to facilitate a vibrant collaboration between the two nearby campuses, (3) involve-ment of undergraduates in research and publishing, (4) mentoring of women and minorities, and (5) interacting with K-12 students through local resources (the UIUC Nano-CEMMS center and the UW-Madison MRSEC), and with a world-wide audience through the nanoHUB.org.",
