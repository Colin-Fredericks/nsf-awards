 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to understand how microscale instabilities in multiscale material systems affect their macroscopic mechanical response, and how they can be exploited to result in tunable low-frequency acoustic band gaps and order-of-magnitude increases in the overall (visco)elastic properties, which will be demonstrated explicitly for metal-polymer structural materials. The integrated theoretical, computational and experimental strategy promises to result in what is urgently needed to advance opportunities in metamaterials: i) experimentally-confirmed physical understanding of effective properties and stability of multiscale systems, ii) computational models for advanced structural materials, and iii) proof-of-concept experiments leading to a novel class of light-weight functional high stiffness-high damping materials for applications ranging from seismic protection and scientific vibration isolation to acoustic wave guides and filters. \r\n\r\nOwing to their superb physical properties, the new materials expected to emerge from the proposed research stand to improve a variety of commercial products in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering, in the defense, transportation, energy and telecommunication industries, and to result in new technologies. The multidisciplinary approach and the potential for technology transfer will promote scientific collaborations beyond Caltech and with industry. The educational component will make a significant impact both locally ? through sustainably improving K-12 STEM education by a long-term classroom partnership program and by promoting hands-on research experience ? and globally ? through international collaborations and research opportunities, and by providing new research-integrated educational resources to students and educators world-wide. Research and teaching will prepare future scientists and engineers for the key challenges in the emerging interdisciplinary field of engineered material systems and provide opportunities for students of all levels to become involved.",

Research included    theory, simulations, and experiments and used structural  metamaterials   (i.e., materials made of small-scale structural members)  as the basis   for probing the influence of small-scale instabilities  on the   large-scale material response. A structural instability (such  as the   buckling of beams or plates) is associated with a multistable  energy   landscape: multiple stable equilibrium configurations exist and  the   system is free to (or can be forced to) transition between those.  What is commonly found in   materials undergoing phase transformations  can be replicated at the   structural level in metamaterials through  controlled buckling or   snapping events. This project has investigated  the impact of such   small-scale instabilities on the macroscale  response of metamaterials, particularly   focusing on two relatively  unexplored areas: dynamics and nonlinearity.   We showed that, unlike  under static conditions, instability under   dynamic conditions can lead  to interesting band gaps in the dispersion   relations (implying that  acoustic waves can be guided and attenuated by a   careful control of  instability) and that the range of stable effective   material  properties can be greatly expanded under dynamic conditions    (constituents of negative stiffness, classically unstable under static    considerations, can be stable and improve the overall mechanical    behavior of a composite material under dynamic conditions). We further    explored the nonlinear dynamics of multistable metamaterials, which    revealed a plethora of new and beneficial phenomena. Starting with    simple 1D chain models and advancing to higher dimensions and more    complex nonlinear behavior, we showed how multistability in periodic    architectures can lead to stable nonlinear transition waves of constant    speed due to a balance between energy release upon snapping from one    equilibrium to the other and the dissipated energy due to damping in  the   system. This was verified both theoretically and numerically at    different scales, resulting in all-soft architectures of high damping    which admit the propagation of constant-speed pulses without the need    for electric or other signals (with potential for soft robotics and    morphing or reconfigurable structures). We have shown the close relation    between such snapping structures and phase transformations in   materials  - both qualitatively and quantitatively - and have conceived a   series  of large-scale structural analogs of atomic-scale structural    transformation phenomena in materials (from phase transitions to    ferroelectric switching). In addition to the discovery of new mechanics    and physics, we have also developed new theoretical and computational    tools to extract the effective material behavior of architected    metamaterials, which includes (i) new homogenization schemes that    predict the linear and nonlinear macroscale material response based on    unit-cell calculations on the smaller scales, (ii) a new way to assess    and visualize directional wave guiding in truss networks (improving  upon   the classical dispersion curves), and (iii) new meshfree  numerical   techniques that admit simulating large deformations and  distortions   without many of the shortcomings of finite element  techniques in this   scenario. Besides generating scientific impact  through the demonstration   of new physical phenomena and the  development of new widely applicable   tools and techniques of  intellectual merit, broader impact was  achieved  through outreach to  local high school students (through lab visits, internships, and  presentations) and domestic and international undergraduate and graduate  students (through visits and research projects) with attention to  underrepresented minorities, and the training of graduate students and  postdocs who all continued onto successful career trajectories in  industry and academia.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dennis&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kochmann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254424/1254424_10224827_1556792445864_CAREER--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254424/1254424_10224827_1556792445864_CAREER--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254424/1254424_10224827_1556792445864_CAREER--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mechanical instability in structural architectures is exploited to generate benficial and tunable large-scale material performance.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">D.
