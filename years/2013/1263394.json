The University of Utah  Department of Physics and Astronomy currently offers a wide variety of research programs in which undergraduates are making significant contributions. The research opportunities within the REU program are numerous and can range from theoretical modeling to experimental work.   For the REU student participants, this program has six specific goals: 1) acquiring research tools, 2) hands on research experience, 3) scientific social networking and activities, 4) fostering diversity through mentorship, 5) developing writing and presentation skills. 6) exploring future directions.",
