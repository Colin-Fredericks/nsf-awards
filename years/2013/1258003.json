 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals produce alarm calls in response to danger.  Recent research suggests that these important calls contain a previously-unsuspected amount of information about the specific type of danger (e.g. predator on the ground, hawk perched, flying hawk, threat level).  In addition, it now appears that many different species of birds and mammals participate in complex communication networks that function as \"distant early warning\" systems about shared threats. This research project will focus on how distant early warning systems of animals work.  The project will develop arrays of extremely sensitive microphones so that the acoustic landscapes of natural habitats can be monitored.  The researchers will introduce live hawks of different types and extremely realistic robotic predators into the experimental habitats.  This research will generate important information about natural distant early warning systems:  How fast and how far do alarm calls spread in natural landscapes?  How is information about threat type and threat level encoded in the alarm calls?  Do all species of birds and mammals participate equally in these communication networks?  In addition to novel information on how natural distant early warning systems work, this innovative project will generate new analytical tools for dealing with complex data about how information spreads in space and time.  Resources generated during the project will be made freely available through the Macaulay Library (the world's largest repository of natural sounds) at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology (http://macaulaylibrary.org). This project will also include a large component of cross-training and mentoring of students in many STEM fields.  In addition, the project will dovetail into the well-developed existing infrastructure for public education through Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology Outreach program, The University of Montana's SpectrUM (an interactive science center), The Montana Natural History Center, and several other activities.  Together these activities will reach many thousands of people per year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAnimals use sounds to communicate many different types of information to each other, such as defending territories, attracting and assessing mates, keeping in contact with others in their social groups, and warning about danger.  Birds are exceptionally good at detecting predators, and they produce a wide variety of important alarm calls.  These alarm calls can be used by individuals of their own and many other species in complex communication networks.  We know little about how different species participate in these communication networks, nor how far and fast the information travels.  We have been experimentally testing how complex alarm call networks operate in winter bird communities in North American.  We have been testing hypotheses about how different species encode information about different threat levels posed by raptors, and how other species decode and share the information contained in the alarm calls.\n\nTo study how birds encode information in their alarm calls, we used a series of extremely realistic robotic raptors.  We used a large range of body sizes and species of robotic raptors, from very small northern pygmy owl (only about four inches tall), screech owl, mid-size sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper?s hawk, up to large northern goshawk and great horned owl (about 30 inches tall).  We conducted these experiments during the winter in the northern Rocky Mountains (Montana), the northern Cascade Mountains (Washington), and in central New York.  We focused on the alarm calls of free-living black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, Steller?s jays and blue jays.  All these species gave alarm calls in response to the robotic raptors, and we found that all these birds encoded information about the threat level in their alarm calls.  \n\nWe were also very interested to see if birds used information from the alarm calls of different species in the forest.  Is there a \"distant early warning system\" in which many species are all listening in to each other?  To see if these complex communication networks exist, we conducted playback experiments using very large arrays microphones and recorders.  These recording arrays allow us to accurately localize the sounds of the animals in the forest, and this allows us to make high resolution maps of the \"acoustic landscape,\" or \"infoscape.\"  We broadcast recordings of high intensity and low intensity alarm calls of Steller?s jays, black-capped chickadees and red-breasted nuthatches and controls.  These experiments allowed us to investigate: 1) which species of birds respond to the alarm calls (and intensities) of other species; 2) how far and how fast information travels in these communication networks; and 3) how long the information persists.\n\nOur research has revealed the fine details about communication networks of wild, free-living birds.  We found that all prey species responded to the alarm calls of the other species by giving their own alarm calls.  Our dynamic maps of the infoscapes show the fine details of how information about predators spreads in time and space.  These distant early warning systems are exceedingly impressive - in some cases waves of information about predators spread through the woods at over 100 miles/h, and the information can travel more than &frac14; mile very quickly. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erick P Greene"
