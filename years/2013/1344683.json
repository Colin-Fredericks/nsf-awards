 "awd_abstract_narration": "A five-day conference is being held at Duke University during December 15-19, 2013. The conference consists of three workshops. The Objective Bayes 2013 Workshop, from December 15-19, consists of three days of scientific sessions, one day of tutorials for graduate students and new researchers, and a poster session, all centering on major recent developments in objective Bayesian methodology. The EFaB@Bayes 250 Workshop, from December 15-16, promotes research and education on Bayesian methods in economics, finance and business, and academic-industry interactions and outreach across these areas. Bayes 250 Day on December 17, celebrates the 250th anniversary of the presentation of Thomas Bayes' paper, with lectures showing the transformative impact of Bayesian analysis on a number of scientific disciplines. The scientific topics considered include foundations of objective Bayesian analysis; objective priors, unification of statistics; spatial and temporal methods; model uncertainty with huge model spaces; nonparametric analysis; massive multiple testing and subgroup analysis; computational issues, especially with massive data; uncertainty quantification; the interface of statistics and computational modeling of processes; and objective Bayesian methods in high energy physics and astrophysics.\r\n \r\nThe Bayes 250 Conference, a five day conference at Duke University during December 15-19, 2013, brings together leading researchers in Bayesian analysis from around the world. The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistical methodology across engineering, medicine and science, and this meeting provides a timely forum for the exchange of recent research developments, provides opportunities for new researchers and underrepresented groups, and establishes new collaborations that will channel efforts into pending problems and open new directions for investigation. The conference is timed to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the publication of the famous paper by Thomas Bayes. The organization of the meeting is designed to facilitate interactions, with at most 7 talks per day and extensive discussion built in. Tutorials and an evening poster session enhance the conference experience for graduate students and new researchers. Funding primarily supports graduate students and new researchers.",
