The Gordon Research Conference is being held from July 14-19, 2013 at Mount Holyoke College, Hadley, MA.  graduate student-led Gordon Research Seminar on Adhesion Science will be held at the same location on July 13-14. In both conferences special efforts will be made by the chairs to increase the attendance of underrepresented groups and people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe field of adhesion science is quite interdisciplinary, drawing on concepts from physics, chemistry, and engineering. In recent years adhesion science has rapidly expanded into the biological sciences, providing a more quantitative undestanding for a range of important\r\nbiological phenomena.  As a result, there is great need for traditional adhesion scientists to collaborate with scientists trained in a variety of disciplines, which include the biological and biomedical sciences. The goal of the 2013 GRC (Gordon Research Conference) on Adhesion Science is to strengthen the interdisciplinary environment that has been fostered by scientists working in all areas related to adhesion science. This goal is reflected in the program which consists of sessions on structural adhesives, soft material physics and mechanics, bio-inspired adhesives, and biomaterials development. The invited speakers come from diverse backgrounds and are leading researchers in their areas of expertise.\r\n\r\nTo extend the broader impact on education, a GRS (Gordon Research Seminar) on adhesion science will be held one day before the GRC at the same location. The goal of the GRS is to provide a highly stimulating and non-intimidating environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to discuss their research in talks and poster sessions, and to build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement.  The GRS is organized by a graduate student with the support of the chair and the vice chair of the GRC on Adhesion Science.  All GRS participants are strongly encouraged to attend the following GRC.",
