 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wearable technology has the ability to facilitate pervasive, continuous understanding of and interaction with the human wearer through garment-integrated wearable sensors and interface technology. However, clothing is more flexible, mobile, and intimate than most electronic technologies, and presents unique challenges for design and manufacture. Start-up costs of developing garments for each application of wearable technology are high. The primary objective of this project is the investigation of a flexible, adaptable garment-integrated architecture for sensing and actuating technologies that will facilitate the development of a wide variety of applications without the need for new hardware development. In addition to flexibility of function, the integration of hardware components into garment structures emphasizes the methods of cut-and-sewn, mass-manufactured apparel. This focus lowers the barrier-to-entry to smart clothing and wearable technology for apparel manufacturers while simultaneously preserving the human factors of apparel including aesthetics and physical comfort.  \r\n\r\nWidespread, pervasive wearable technology would allow medical conditions to be continuously and imperceptibly monitored without requiring a clinical visit or hospital stay, and would allow personal devices to become context-aware, providing information and alerts that are responsive to the activities, objectives, and social context of the user. Smart clothing can shift the frontiers of healthcare and medical monitoring, human-device interface, apparel consumption and use, and many other fields. Innovation and expertise in the production of electronic textiles and clothing offers strong competitive advantage to the US apparel industry. Further, smart clothing development effectively bridges many interdisciplinary fields, including the predominantly-female field of clothing design. Activities supported by this project expand the participation of women in STEM disciplines and encourage interdisiplinarity in education.",

Smart clothing offers the ability to do more by placing technology in more body locations. However, garment-based technologies are hard to design and manufacture. This project sought to understand the full scope of what technology could do if it were to be embedded in a garment platform, and to develop methods of manufacturing such a garment platform in the apparel factories of today and tomorrow. Toward these goals, we conducted visioning sessions with designers and engineers and analyzed the resulting product concepts, to compare them with the scope of designs that have been produced by academia and industry. In parallel, we developed a method for manufacturing textile circuits that leverages the things that are efficient about typical electronics manufacturing (standardized components, soldered connections, CAD-supported workflows) as well as the practices that are commonplace in apparel manufacturing (cut-and-sew assembly). We collaborated with NASA's Johnson Space Center on this effort, as garment-based electronics are also a high-potential area for astronauts during long-duration spaceflight.</p>\n<p>Our manufacturing method is deployable in almost any apparel factory with far less impact on current practices or equipment than most approaches to e-textile manufacturing, but it's durable enough to survive laundering and daily wear-and-tear. We tested our manufacturing method under a wide variety of manufacturing and durability conditions, and conducted a case study investigation comparing the manufacturing of a typical firefighter turnout coat liner with the manufacturing of the same liner with an embedded temperature-sensing system that measures local temperatures around the wearer's body. The results offer detailed insights for apparel manufacturers looking to transition to e-textile products, and for wearable technology designers moving from rigid devices like wristbands into textiles and clothing. The team is involved in building a spin-off company to translate these techniques for broader use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project research is highly interdisciplinary, and involved team members from backgrounds like apparel design, human factors engineering, textile engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. The interdisciplinary nature of the work helped us recruit a diverse team (60% female/non-binary). We translated the team expertise, fabrication techniques and garment examples involved in the project into learning experiences in a summer program offered each year in partnership with several local and national organizations, focused on enabling STEM career exploration for 14-16 yr old students experiencing employment barriers. We also worked with NSF to showcase this work at the USA Science and Engineering Festival in DC, and with designers on creative work that used the techniques developed in this project for artistic purposes.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lucy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Dunne</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253581/1253581_10229323_1608616775037_Swatch-555-Fastener(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253581/1253581_10229323_1608616775037_Swatch-555-Fastener(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stitched e-textile circuits\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253581/1253581_10229323_1608616775037_Swatch-555-Fastener(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stitched e-textile circuits\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our method of e-textile circuit fabrication is designed to be deployable in almost any apparel factory.
