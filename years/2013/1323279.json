 "awd_abstract_narration": "This TUES Type 2 project is establishing the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the centerpiece of a community of practice.  The aim is to facilitate the transformation of undergraduate civil and environmental engineering programs by incorporating infrastructure topics into their existing curriculum.  This project builds upon the sophomore-level courses and other modules on civil infrastructure developed by the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department of the University of Wisconsin-Platteville and the Civil Engineering program at West Point Military Academy.  The six collaborating institutions are of varying sizes, student population, and settings (Arizona State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Norwich University, Portland State University, Rowan University, and University of Toledo).  The project objectives are to: 1) establish and sustain the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the source for infrastructure education materials that can be continuously improved by a community of practice, 2) develop educational expertise in infrastructure topics and in pedagogy in faculty at collaborating institutions, 3) deliver, assess, and institutionalize infrastructure-themed courses or modules for CEE and other majors at collaborating institutions, 4) enhance the ability of CEE students to view components and systems designed in CEE sub-disciplines as integral parts of the larger infrastructure system, and 5) enhance the ability of CEE students to view infrastructure challenges from a societal, rather than solely technical, perspective. \r\n\r\nThe project employs a creative model that engages collaborating faculty in roles of content creators and module maintainers of the infrastructure-themed course material to develop and sustain the community of practice.  In addition, a structured plan to facilitate the adoption and institutionalization of infrastructure curricular material at the six collaborating institutions, and provide faculty development and support is used.\r\n\r\nMore than 500 students and fifteen faculty at eight diverse institutions, including some with large numbers of underrepresented minority students, are directly impacted by the project activities, increasing the number of students and faculty with knowledge and expertise in sustainable infrastructure topics.  A community of practice centered on CIT-E and multiple faculty development workshops is employed to facilitate the dissemination and adoption of the curricular material and practices developed in this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award has helped establish the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E, pronounced 'city') as a rich resource of teaching materials for faculty and staff from across the nation.  These materials comprise a \"model\" introduction to infrastructure course, aimed at first- and second-year civil and environmental engineering students. \n\nSix workshops have been held to support this grant, reaching more than 20 universities.  These workshops have provided attendees with a variety of knowledge and skills, including topics such as active learning, creating screencasts, the need for infrastructure education, etc.  Each workshop provided several novel venues for professional networking, including a \"graffiti poster session\" and a \"speed dating\" session.  Through dissemination efforts at conferences, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department Heads listserv, and the project website (www.cit-e.org), we have compiled a mailing list of nearly 150 interested faculty and staff from around the world.\n\nThe content of this course was created in a series of face-to-face and web-based meetings with expert panels of faculty from across the US using a modified Delphi process.  The model course consists of five modules (Fundamentals; One Water; Transportation; Energy; Capstone) and 43 lessons.  Each lesson was created by a team of faculty; most lessons were started in face-to-face summer workshops.  The resulting lesson materials are engaging, student-focused, creative, and \"fun\".    An instructor may freely access individual lessons or the entire course; each lesson includes a lesson outline complete with learning outcomes, a supporting PowerPoint file, in-class activities with instructions, homework assignments, and homework solutions.  The course has demonstrated that it helps students think more holistically about non-technical and societal aspects of engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip J Parker"
