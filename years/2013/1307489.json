 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research by a group at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) to model merging black holes and neutron stars and the gravitational waves they emit. Merging black holes and neutron stars are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), and black hole-neutron star mergers are one possible source of short, hard gamma-ray bursts.  This research program uses supercomputers to numerically solve Einstein's equations of general relativity for i) merging black holes, especially cases (such as mergers with black holes that are spinning nearly as rapidly as possible) that have not been previously explored, and ii) a black hole, spinning nearly as rapidly as possible, that merges with a neutron star, tearing the star apart.\r\n\r\nAlmost a century after Einstein first predicted their existence, gravitational waves---ripples of spacetime curvature---are poised to open a new window on the universe. Advanced LIGO, an NSF-supported project, is nearing completion and will soon begin searching for gravitational waves from black holes, neutron stars, and other sources, such as supernovae. By predicting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and neutron stars, this research program will increase the reach of Advanced LIGO and will help us to learn as much as possible about LIGO's astronomical sources. Through their participation in this program, students at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate- and Hispanic-serving institution, will learn transferable research and computational skills while playing important roles in preparing for the first direct detections of gravitational waves, an imminent discovery that could dramatically alter our understanding of the universe.",
