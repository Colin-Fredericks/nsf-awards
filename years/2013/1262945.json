 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the UMM REU program is to develop time-constrained models for two very different proposed paleo-ice streams.  REU participants will study glacial deposits of the Late Paleozoic Paran\u00e1 lobe of Brazil and Late Pleistocene age Des Moines lobe of Minnesota.  Detailed mapping of landforms, sediment analysis and the analysis of subglacial bedforms will provide a greater understanding of the movement and the causes of rapid ice stream flow. The role of ice streams in the mass balance of ice sheets is of critical importance (approximately 90% of all discharge of the Antarctic ice sheet is by ice streams), yet a great deal is unknown.  This research will focus on: the influence of climate on ice stream movement, the significance of marine interaction and ice sheet grounding, and the nature of ice stream flow (sliding vs. deformation).  Uniquely, participants have an opportunity to research ice streams in two very different geologic contexts: in Minnesota they will study surficial geology and unconsolidated sands and gravels while in Brazil they will study stratigraphy and sedimentary rocks.  \r\n\r\nThe UMM REU program will also nurture the development of 16 Native American women geology majors over two summers in both an international setting and in an environment where women and Native Americans are in the majority. Native American women are extremely underrepresented in the Geosciences.  The UMM REU program has components designed specifically to remedy this situation by providing peer support, developing participant confidence and introducing participants to supportive role models.  UMM REU students will participate in a seminar component of the program where they will examine pathways to \"thinking like a geologist,\" issues in scientific ethics, meet professional women geoscientists, and begin planning future academic and scientific careers.  Participants will give a professional talk and lead a field trip.  This program will build confidence and aid in the maturation of these Native American women as scientists and individuals.  \r\n\r\nThis REU site is co-funded by the Office of International and Integrated Activities and the Division of Earth Sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\n \n\nToday, glaciers contain about 2% of the earth?s water.  When glaciers melt, the meltwater that is created ultimately flows into the oceans. Thus, melting glaciers contribute to sea level rise.  If glaciers melt slowly then the resultant sea level rise will be slow and, in theory, people will have time to prepare for changing sea levels.  However, recent studies of Antarctica have suggested that because of Ice Streams, continent-sized glaciers, called \"Ice Sheets,\" may melt much faster than climate models would predict.  If rapid melting of the Ice Sheets on Antarctica and Greenland were to occur, the rapid rise in sea level would be catastrophic.\n\n \n\nIce Streams are rapidly flowing \"rivers of ice\" set within the slower moving ice of an Ice Sheet. Ice Streams flow at rates 100 times faster than the surrounding Ice Sheet. Studies of the Antarctic Ice Streams suggest that Ice Streams have the potential to drain up to 90% of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.  So, if Ice Sheets melt due to climate change, the process is slow.  However, if Ice Sheets melt by rapid flow of Ice Streams into the ocean, the process is quick - and the resulting sea level rise would also be rapid.  It is very important than to understand if Ice Streams play an important role in Ice Sheet melting. \n\n \n\nThe goal of the UMM REU program was to study the geologic record of two ancient Ice Streams  to determine how large an impact Ice Streams had on ancient Ice Sheets.  The two Ice Streams studied were the Des Moines lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (which existed 18,000 to 14,000 years ago) and the Paran&aacute; lobe of the Gondwana Ice Sheet (which existed 300 million years ago).  Note: the term \"lobe\" is used to describe a section of an Ice Sheet that behaves independently from other sections of the Ice Sheet. \n\n \n\n REU participants studied glacial deposits of the Paran&aacute; lobe in Brazil and the Des Moines lobe in Minnesota.  Detailed mapping of glacially constructed landforms, the analysis of glacial sediments and the analysis of features formed under the glaciers enabled a greater understanding of the movement and the causes of rapid Ice Stream flow. Uniquely, REU participants had the opportunity to conduct research on Ice Streams in two very different geologic contexts: in Minnesota, they studied surficial geology and unconsolidated sands and gravels; while in Brazil, they studied stratigraphy and sedimentary rocks. \n\n \n\nThere were some very significant results achieved.  Mapping, analysis and dating of glacial sediments associated with the Big Stone Moraine in western Minnesota show that the moraine was formed by three successive advances of the Des Moines Lobe: the outer Big Stone Moraine (oldest), the Inner Big Stone Moraine and the Mustinka River margin (youngest).  These three depositional events, together with the formation of Glacial Lake Benson just prior to the deposition of the outer Big Stone Moraine all occurred quickly (between 15,000 and 14,000 years BP) but they were not separated by large glacial retreats.  If the Des Moines lobe was behaving as an Ice Stream it would be expected that during the time intervals between the formation of the outer Big Stone Moraine (oldest), the Inner Big Stone Moraine and the Mustinka River margin (youngest) there would have been a very substantial retreat of the ice margin.  Based on our research, there is no evidence of a major ice retreat. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe results of this research indicate that the Des Moines lobe underwent 3 short lived readvances between 14,000 and 15,000 yr BP that resulted in the formation of the Big Stone Moraine.  These advances appear to be the result of a short lived climatic cooling phase during the otherwise warm late glacial deglaciation.  Thus, it appears that the overall deglaciation of the Des Moines Lobe was controlled by a warming climate, not by the dynamics of glacial flow (rapid sliding of the Ice Stream). We will now try to correlate the formation of the Big Stone Moraine with other late glacial readvances in the midwest. \n\n \n\nBroader Outcomes\n\nThe UMM REU program also nurtured the development of 17 Native American women geology majors over three summers in both an international setting and in an environment where women and Native Americans are in the majority. Native American women are extremely underrepresented in the Geosciences.  The UMM REU program had components designed specifically to remedy this situation by providing peer support, developing participant confidence and introducing participants to supportive role models. Of the 17 participants, four are still undergraduate students in geology programs, four are in graduate school, five are professional geologists, two are looking for positions in the geosciences, one is in nursing school and one is taking a hiatus from school to start a family.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James F P Cotter"
