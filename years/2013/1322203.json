It will employ participant observation, in-depth interviews, and archival research to explore how ideas about care and rehabilitation - including which animals can be sheltered and how best to determine and meet their needs - shape human-animal interactions and how these ideas and interactions have changed over time.  Ethnographic research will take place in three private, non-profit zoological facilities. \r\n\r\nThis project will build on a growing body of work on multispecies ethnographies in anthropology and in other disciplines that seeks to illuminate how human-animal interactions in a range of scientific and applied contexts shape human understandings of animals and multispecies relationships. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the training of a graduate student in anthropology. In addition, the resulting Ph.D. dissertation, articles, and public presentations will inform a deeper understanding of the ethics of animal treatment in contemporary US society.",
