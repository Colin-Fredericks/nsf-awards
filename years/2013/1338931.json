The UNT site will conduct a cooperative research that features a highly leveraged and pooled research program that includes graduate students, faculty researchers and industry professional engineers. The research thrusts will provide solutions to significantly improve the industrys yield and contribute to its economic competitiveness. \r\n\r\nThe establishment of new research site at UNT will further extend the capability of the current Center for Tire Research, and enhance UNT's ability to open doors to many industry sponsors near the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) area, as well as obtain funding from other federal and state agencies. The envisioned research topics on sustainability of tires at the UNT site will benefit society for reducing the negative environmental effects of tires. The proposed center site will plan to provide graduate students and faculty with a technology platform to conduct industry-relevant research, establish an effective mechanism for collaboration, and will help promote, catalyze, and accelerate the commercialization of innovative technologies.",
