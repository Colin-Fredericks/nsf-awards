 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a fundamental study of the processing of semiconductor-core waveguides from materials that are able to be formed into fiber form, in concert with most regular glasses, and that facilitate refractive index engineering to create complex waveguide cores for optical fibers for use in the delivery and manipulation of mid-infrared laser beams. Borosilicate glass fibers with layered silicon and germanium alloy cores will be designed and fabricated, where the light is to be completely confined in the core so as to minimize loss during use. The system is chosen to allow semi-solid deformation of the semiconductor core, where the liquid composition of the different layers will be identical. The sharpness of the interface is determined by the diffusion of solid grains in a liquid and will be critical for performance. The diffusion of the interface will be studied, both microstructurally, and by changes in optical properties. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the complex multicomponent modified chemical vapor deposition process, an understanding of the semi-solid deformation of semiconductor alloys, optical waveguide design, and the ability for waveguide processing control in layered semiconductor-core fibers. The successful completion of this research will have significant impact, ranging from biomedical surgery, information decoding, hazardous chemical sensing, to technologies that enhance defense capabilities. Low loss mid-infrared waveguides will enable delivery and manipulation of mid-infrared laser beams and this capability will open up new markets for mid-infrared lasers, an area that is ripe for growth. Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will be directly involved in the research effort. A module demonstrating optical fiber technology will be developed for use as an outreach tool.",
