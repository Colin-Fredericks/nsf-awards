 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics (ascent rate, mass eruption rate, lava flow rate, etc.) of submarine eruptions, which account for roughly 70% of the Earth's annual volcanic activity, are essentially unknown. This research will develop a degassing-based \"geospeedometer\" (i.e., a method for determining how fast magma moves from its magma chamber to its final resting place on the sea floor).  for mid-ocean ridge basalts that will allow quantification of eruption dynamics in Earth's largest volcanic system (i.e., the mid-ocean ridge spreading centers) and help to evaluate how those dynamics impact carbon fluxes from the vast mid-ocean ridge system. A combination of detailed microanalysis of textures and volatiles in lava samples from submarine volcanic lava flows and a unique set of laboratory experiments will be used to quantify the mechanisms and rates of degassing and vesiculation in mid-ocean ridge basalts. A \"geospeedometer\" will be developed on the basis of those results. This geospeedometer will allow us to understand and measure flow rates of mid-ocean ridge lavas, decompression rates of the eruptions feeding them, and how flow morphologies (sheet flow vs. pillow lava) reflect eruption rate. Analyses will be focused on samples from the well mapped and comprehensively sampled 2011 eruption of Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the northwest coast of the US and Canada. Samples from this eruption will be analyzed for degassing via volatile concentrations and vesicle-size distributions of samples collected along the Axial Volcano eruptive fissures and flow paths. A central challenge will be the linking of temerature, depressurization rate, and composition to volatile concentrations and vesicle populations. Thus, a series of laboratory decompression and cooling experiments using natural, CO2-supersaturated, mid-ocean ridge basalts will be undertaken to provide insights and input parameters for model calculations, leading to the quantification of results. the 2011 eruption of Axial Volcano will serve as the test case and be used to refine models of degassing and provide the vehicle for incorporating research reesults into broadly applicable models for submarine volcanic systems.  The research will also help improve estimates of carbon flux by evaluating more rigorously and quantitatively the controls on seafloor basalt degassing of CO2. Broader impacts of the research include support of graduate and undergraduate students and engagement of the investigators with K-12 STEM teachers via already plannedteacher training workshops.  Research will also be incorporated into courses taught by the investigators and data will be made freely available to the public through NSF-funded data management facilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded research focused on the dynamics of degassing of erupted basaltic magmas at the Mid-Ocean Ridge (MORB), the major location of Earth?s magmatism.  It has long been held that the style of eruptions along the Mid-Ocean Ridge is linked to the spreading rate along the ridge, although the rates of magma ascent and eruption at ridges is poorly constrained because of the remote location of these eruptions.  One approach to constraining the rate of eruption of MORB is proposed to be assessing the amount of degassing that the lavas have undergone, because the rates of bubble nucleation and growth are kinetic processes that can be timed, and hence extrapolated to the time of magma ascent and lave spreading.  Linking degassing rates to the style of eruption would better constrain the dynamics of eruptions along the Mid-Ocean Ridge.\n\n \n\nIt has long been recognized that MORB samples have dissolved gases in them, with the major species being carbon dioxide (CO2).  But, the concentrations measured usually exceeded those expected given experimentally constrained solubility laws.  The scientific community has been split, with most arguing that this apparent oversaturation of CO2 results from magmas rising and erupting faster than bubbles can form, as opposed to a few who suggest that the conditions of the eruptions are such that new bubbles cannot nucleate.  This latter suggestion stems from the proposition that the surface tension that acts as a kinetic barrier to prevent CO2 bubbles from nucleating homogenously.  Work carried out at the University of Texas at Austin focused on investigating the occurrence of gas bubbles in MORB, and how to constrain the rates of nucleation of growth of those bubbles.\n\n \n\nDetailed examination of bubble sizes and abundances linked to dissolved concentrations of CO2 showed that indeed MORB erupted along the East Pacific Rise, the fastest spreading segment of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, magmas rose from the axial magma chamber to the seafloor at a rate of 2-3 kilometers per hour, fast enough that little to no CO2 was able to exsolve from the rising magma into gas bubbles.  Modeling of diffusive loss of CO2 from the melt to gas bubbles suggests that the lava spread along the seafloor at a few kilometers per hour.  Over the first ~1000 meters the lava nucleated few gas bubbles, despite being highly supersaturated in CO2.  When crystals started to form, as a result of slight cooling of the lava on the seafloor, gas bubbles nucleated abundantly, causing rapid depletion of the lava in gas.\n\n \nSimilar measurements carried out on MORB samples collected from the Juan de Fuca ridge (intermediate spreading) and Mid-Atlantic ridge (slow spreading) confirmed that the nucleation and growth of gas bubbles is linked to occurrence of small crystals that grew in the lava as it erupted and cooled.  These findings demonstrate that the common overabundance of CO2 in MORB samples results from the kinetic barrier to nucleation of bubbles homogeneously.  It is only when crystals form and act as heterogeneities that gas bubbles can nucleate abundantly.  These results change our understanding of bubble formation in MORB, and the use of their abundances and sizes as recorders of eruption dynamics.  One important conclusion is that before any new bubbles form, the abundance of CO2 in the melt directly reflects the rate of rise of magma from the magma chamber to the seafloor.  MORB samples from the Pacific ridge are generally more supersaturated in dissolved CO2 than those from slower spreading Atlantic and Indian ridges. Our results suggest that Pacific MORBs ascend to the seafloor faster than Atlantic or Indian MORBs.  This confirms that magma ascent, and hence eruption style, is linked to spreading rate.\n \nThe outcomes of this study were achieved by supporting one Ph.D. graduate student and two undergraduates, one of which was female.  Both of the undergraduates have gone on to graduate school to pursue higher degrees in geology.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James E Gardner"
