 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Morphology and Molecules: Diatom Diversification, Extinction, and Dispersal in an Ancient Tropical Lake System\r\n\r\nSherilyn Fritz and Paul Baker\r\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln and Duke University\r\n\r\nThe origins of endemic floras and faunas, those that are restricted to a specific geographic area, have intrigued natural scientists for well over a century.  The evolution of endemic groups has been attributed to habitat stability through multiple climate cycles, which fostered the build-up of genetic diversity through long periods of time, or alternatively to colonization and extensive radiation following episodes of massive disturbance.  Thus, very different trajectories of environmental history (stability versus instability) have been posited to bring about higher levels of endemism and biodiversity. This highly interdisciplinary project will integrate fossil data from sediment cores with molecular phylogeography to test hypotheses about the magnitude and rate of morphological and genetic variation in a major lineage of planktonic diatom in the tropical Andes, the Cyclostephanos andinus complex.  Micropaleontological analyses of morphological diversification and extinction in the C. andinus complex during the last ~0.4 my will be studied using cores collected previously from Lake Titicaca, Bolivia/Peru and Lago Chungar\u00e1, Chile and compared with independent measures of climate variation analyzed in the same samples to assess the role of environmental drivers in the patterns of evolutionary change. The project also will sample multiple lakes in the Andean Altiplano to characterize the genetic composition of modern C. andinus populations and to assess genetic variation among the populations to infer intraspecific evolutionary histories (including vicariance, dispersal, and gene flow).  If flow is limited, genetic characterization of populations from Lake Titicaca and Lago Chungar\u00e1 can be used to inform molecular clock methods to derive hypotheses about the timing of genetic divergences of multiple populations.  In addition, the history of the C. andinus complex will be placed within a broader biogeographic framework by establishing the geographic distribution of all members of the genus Cyclostephanos in tropical South American lakes. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts\r\nDirect observation of the fossil record and molecular genetic characterization of contemporary populations are complementary approaches for studying the patterns and rates of evolutionary change.  Yet these two approaches have rarely been combined in a single study to investigate diversification, dispersal and extinction.  This project is highly interdisciplinary and takes advantage of the rich framework generated by a prior large-lake drilling program to investigate evolutionary biology.  The research presents a creative model for the linkage of new molecular genetic approaches with traditional paleontological and biogeographic tools to investigate evolutionary processes in microorganisms and will train a graduate student at this exciting interdisciplinary frontier.  In addition, K-12 students and other members of the public will be exposed to this interdisciplinary intersection of geology and molecular genetics by the active engagement of project investigators in education and outreach activities in Nebraska.",

Over time, the sediments of these lakes collect material washed or blown in from the landscape around the lake, as well as the fossil remains of organisms that lived within the lake. Thus, the sediments provide an archive of the history of environmental and evolutionary change. Lake Titicaca, which spans the border of Bolivia and Peru, has existed for at least 400,000 years. The modern lake contains a unique species of microscopic plant, a diatom, called <em>Cyclostephanos andinus. </em>This species, which is named for the high Andes mountains where it occurs, is geographically restricted to lakes in the Andes, and its fossilized remains can be found in various sediment layers based on analysis of cores extracted by drilling through the bottom sediment of the lake. The species thrives in the deep open waters of the lake today and also was abundant during times in the past when climate was wet and Lake Titicaca was deep. During the history of Lake Titicaca, <em>Cyclostephanos andinus </em>has changed its mean size, shifting from cells that were very small and all very similar to larger cells that were more variable in size and ornamentation. The objective of this project was (1) to characterize the changes in size and morphology of this diatom species through time, and (2) to compare the size evolution to changes within the lake environment to evaluate whether shifts in lake depth or other environmental characteristics were affecting diatom populations and subsequent evolutionary change. Our findings showed that the size of this diatom species<em> </em>did not evolve gradually, but rather size increased abruptly in two phases during intervals of massive environmental change. The first rapid change occurred when the lake became deeper as a result of tectonic activity in the basin - in other words, an increase in lake depth caused by movements of the Earth&rsquo;s crust. The second rapid change in valve size was also in response to lake depth, but this change in depth was associated with the rapid transition from the driest interval of the entire lake history to a very wet period. Because lake depth affects the intensity of mixing of the water within the lake, we hypothesize that the increased mixing in a deeper lake enabled larger sized organisms to remain suspended within the water column. This research helps to generate a better understanding of the rates and causes of evolution in microorganisms and how environmental dynamics can affect that evolutionary process. The research project also was interdisciplinary in that it combined studies of biology and geology in an unusual way. The project resulted in six manuscripts published or in review, one doctoral dissertation, and several national and international presentations. Project activities also trained one postdoctoral scholar, two graduate students, and five undergraduate students. Research results were integrated into public outreach activities with the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), the University of Nebraska State Museum, and used in presentations to citizen groups throughout the state of Nebraska. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sherilyn&nbsp;C&nbsp;Fritz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1251678/1251678_10241211_1491159161666_C.andinusSEM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1251678/1251678_10241211_1491159161666_C.andinusSEM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cyclostephanos andinus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1251678/1251678_10241211_1491159161666_C.andinusSEM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclostephanos andinus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SEM images of Cyclostephanos andinus from Lake Titicaca sediments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Trisha Spanbauer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sherilyn&nbsp;C&nbsp;Fritz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cyclostephanos andinus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
