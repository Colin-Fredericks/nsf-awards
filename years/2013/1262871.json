Funds are provided to continue the Svalbard REU program for another year, based on the success of the program. Student research focuses on the climatic and surficial processes that operate in rapidly changing glacial, lacustrine, and fjord systems that may, in turn, archive the signature of anthropogenic changes in the high Arctic. Students define their research questions and design specific testable hypotheses throughout the program, complete their research projects at their home institutions during the following academic year and present their results at a professional conference. Most alumni of the program have gone into graduate programs better prepared for fundamental research.",
