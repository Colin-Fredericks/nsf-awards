 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators plan a three-year effort to improve understanding and prediction of surface melting on the Greenland ice sheet. Satellite remote-sensing, regional climate modeling and nonlinear analysis techniques will be used to: assess variability of observed surface melt occurrence; benchmark model-based melt proxies versus observed melt; diagnose synoptic-scale meteorological/sea-ice controls on melt; and assess future change in melt proxies based on regional models driven by CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) general circulation models (GCMs). Understanding surface melt on polar ice sheets is important because surface melt affects albedo, can produce useful paleoclimatic records, contributes to mass balance through runoff, and is a trigger for ice-shelf collapse leading to ice-flow acceleration and sea-level rise. Improved understanding of the synoptic-meteorological causes of melting, and of the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate melting accurately, would help assess the effects of future warming on melting, ice-sheet flow and sea level rise. The investigators propose three main research themes to help address these issues: (1) regional-atmospheric-model skill assessments and diagnosis of present synoptic controls on surface melt; (2) application of results from the model skill assessments to GCM-based climate scenarios for estimates of future change; and (3) expanding satellite-based retrieval of surface melt state characterization through retrieval of melt magnitude using a novel fusion of passive microwave and optical/thermal satellite data. In addition to addressing key questions relating Greenland ice sheet balance to sea-level change, the project includes outreach to the public, primarily through a web site, and numerous educational impacts. The project would support undergraduate and graduate students, and involves investigators from a primarily undergraduate institution with a significant population of first-generation college students, and from a Hispanic-serving institution. All data and model results will be archived and made available through the ACADIS data center.",

By combining satellite remote-sensing of melting, a regional weather forecast model and a simple model for temperature-driven surface melting, we gained a better picture of future change under high and low warming scenarios.\n\nSatellite remote-sensing provides 40-plus years of surface melting observations across the ice sheet and a look at variability (timing, spatial patterns) over decades.  As a reference, these data also support melt model skill testing.\n\nWe used our regional forecast model (Polar WRF) in both historical (late 20th/early 21st century) and future (2071-2080) timeframes to (1) test our melt prediction model against observations and (2) make future melt predictions.\n\nHistorical weather forecasts use global boundary data from reanalysis or global climate models (GCMs).  Future forecasts can only use GCMs.  To study two potential extremes, we used \"high warming\" (RCP 8.5) and \"low warming\" emissions scenarios.  The former includes emissions expected to increase global mean temperature by 5-6 degrees C over pre-industrial levels in 2100.  The latter limits the increase to 1.5 degrees C.  Because local changes differ from global averages, a regional model is needed to understand Greenland's futures.\n\nCollectively, these forecasts represent a significant resource for the polar meteorology and climatology communities with 14 TB of model outputs archived at the Arctic Data Center.\n\nWe tested reanalysis, GCM and forecast model skill with daily average temperature observations from eleven Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) automatic weather stations (AWS).  The benefits of the forecast model\u2019s 15 km spatial resolution and improved polar-centric model physics were notable:  mean model biases at the AWS were reduced from 0.7-3.6 degrees C (reanalysis) and  -2.9 to 4.2 degrees C (GCM) to -1.4 to 1 degrees C in the forecast model.\n\nWe also compared future (2071-80) predictions to the historical observations to evaluate potential futures in GCM and forecast model data.  For \"high warming\", the forecast model predicts future July warming of 1.5-5.4 degrees C compared to the GCM's higher and narrower range of 4-6.1 degrees C.

In the low (high) range, no observations of melting (no melting) are seen therefore melt probability is zero (one) and melt occurrence is \"no melt\" (\"melt\").\n\nIn the transitional range between the peaks of the \"no melt\" and \"melt\" temperature distributions, melt occurrence probability (0-1) is a linear interpolation of modeled temperature into this range.  Melt occurrence (zero or one) applies a threshold to the probability value. The threshold minimizes the difference between predicted and observed melt in the transitional range.\n\nFor example, if the modeled temperature interpolates to 0.7 and the threshold was calculated at 0.78, the probability of melt is recorded as 0.7 and, because 0.7 &lt; 0.78, melt occurrence is set to zero (\"no melt\").\n\nComparisons of the two model datasets to observations (Figure 3) are qualitatively favorable with a similar spatial distribution of over- and underestimation of total melt days for the two datasets: too few melt days in the south and extreme northeast, too many in the northwest and the southeast coastline.\n\nAs expected under the significant global warming of RCP 8.5, surface melting is more extensive and frequent (Figure 3) with dramatic spatial changes in the north and notable increases of the melting boundary elevation around the entire ice sheet.
