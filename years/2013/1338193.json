 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish an Alaska in-state capability for hyper-spectral (HS) imaging by acquiring a state-of-the-art, yet cost-effective, visible to shortwave infrared HS imaging system that will be deployed for airborne and ground-based\r\nremote sensing. The project will integrate, commission, and deploy the system over selected Alaskan study sites and will build the necessary maintenance and operations infrastructure to support the provision of high quality HS data products for Alaskan science\r\nand applications. This will support basic and applied research, research training, and educational\r\nactivities. The imaging system will be key  for both repeat monitoring and rapid response deployments that could lead to important scientific insight, as well as a number of more pragmatic benefits such as wildfire response and assessment, mineral resource exploration, and mapping of contaminated sediments.\r\nBeside specific courses that will make use of the new imaging system, there will be a number of graduate students and post-docs that will be trained using this facility.The project also proposes STEM and K-12 outreach activities.  The images acquired through this MRI will be broadly distributed, as carefully detailed in the management plan, and favoring interdisciplinary research on the effects of climate change on high-latitude environments.",
