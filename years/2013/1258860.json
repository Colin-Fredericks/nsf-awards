 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is one key segment of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime over the U.S. Great lakes region and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this group will focus on so-called \"long-fetch\" storm events, for which low-level winds are aligned approximately parallel to Lake Ontario's long axis.  Observational assets to be employed during OWLeS include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other deployable surface measurement systems.  These researchers contend that predictions of the amounts and inland extent of LeS snowfall remain poor, due in part to fine-scale variations in upwind planetary boundary layer structure and poor representation of cloud microphysical, dynamical, and surface processes.  To address these shortcomings, the intellectual merits of this research will derive from improved understanding of:  1) How long-fetch LeS intensify and evolve downwind of the lake, where prolonged heavy snowfall rates are particularly impactful; 2) how cloud and dynamical processes may contribute to cloud electrification and to lightning, as occasionally observed in long-fetch LeS heavy precipitation cells; and 3) how dual-polarimetric (and in select regions, dual-Doppler) radar measurements at X- and S-band wavelengths as utilized by mobile-DOW and operational National Weather Service WSR-88D radars, respectively, may reveal detailed precipitation processes in LeS.  Through detailed comparisons with in-situ aircraft measurements, evaluations dual-polarimetric particle identification and quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) algorithms will extend the utility of remote-sensing observations in this unique cool-season environment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include experience infield campaign planning, hands-on data collection and data analysis for a notably large number of undergraduate as well as graduate students.  A desirable mix of junior and senior principal investigators will facilitate exchange of established and complex project design and observing methodologies, and foster improved field observing techniques tailored to severe winter weather conditions.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.  Given the significant impacts of lake effect snowfall on public safety and economic activity along the populous shores of the U.S. Great Lakes, improved understanding of lake-effect systems should foster refined models and forecasting techniques that will address a longer-term societal need.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Lake-induced snowfall poses a significant local risk in the areas affected.  The area downwind (generally east) of Lake Ontario in particu&shy;lar experiences some of the most locally intense snowstorms in the world.   Improvement of forecasts of lake-effect snow requires a greater understanding of the structure and dynamics of these convective snow systems.  Thus, the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) project was formed.\n\n The research conducted under this NSF grant directly targeted this problem. The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) collaborated with other research groups from the University of Wyoming (UW), State University of New York at Oswego, University of Illinois, University of Utah, Millersville University, the Illinois State Water Survey, and the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) to acquire detailed field observations of the internal structure and near environment of lake-effect snow storms.  The primary goal of the UAH researchers was to contribute to the field campaign by acquiring vertical profiles of precipitation, wind, temperature, humidity, and clouds.  A rich data set was collected during about 20 Intensive Operational Periods during December 2013 and January 2014, in which the weather was exceedingly favorable for lake effect snows.  Research facilities included the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System (MIPS), three CSWR dual polarization Doppler radars, the UW instrumented King Air research aircraft, special ground-based precipitation radar systems, radiosondes, and other equipment. The OWLeS project was designed to address outstanding scientific questions about winter lake-effect snow storm structure, with the goal of improving our understanding of snowstorms and blizzards in localized areas downwind of the Great Lakes of the continental United States. The OWLeS field campaign was designed to provide new insight concerning radar measurements of winter weather systems that can translate directly into better operational interpretation and observation strategies of winter weather.  The education components of the project included numerous undergraduate and graduate students, from the participating universities, in the field campaign and subsequent analysis efforts.\n\n The outcomes of this project fall into two categories, data collection and analysis results.  Under data collection, an important outcome was the development of a rich data set on vertical profiles of precipitation, vertical motion, temperature, and humidity with lake effect snow bands.  This data has been used by other investigators, and will continue to be used by other scientists and students in the future.\n\nThe analysis performed under this grant examined unique data from a vigorous convective snow band that moved over the MIPS ahead of an approaching cold front.  The relevant outcomes of this analysis include several discoveries about the internal structure and propagation mechanisms of lake-effect snow bands:\n\na)     The southward propagation was produced by a well-defined gust front that did not behave like a density current, i.e., it was not forced by the presence of cold air within the band.  There was a negligible temperature contrast ahead of and behind the gust front.  This has not been directly documented in previous studies.  Preliminary analyses of other cases over land east of Lake Ontario has indicated that gust fronts associated with snow bands were driven by temperature (density) contrasts near the surface.\n\nb)    Significant amounts of supercooled water are associated with updrafts within lake-effect snow bands.  The present of supercooled water promotes snow growth by riming and enhanced deposition.\n\nc)     A 12 m/s updraft measured within this snow band was not associated with lightning.  That such a strong updraft (the strongest measured by the MIPS during this field campaign) was not associated with lightning indicates that charge separation depends on other factors besides updraft intensity.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin R Knupp"
