 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source technologies at 6.Xnm wavelength to fill technology gaps in advanced lithography for future generations of integrated circuits. These technologies serve the semiconductor industry, with a world market valued of $298 Billion, that manufactures the semiconductor chips used in virtually all industrial, automotive, telecommunications, computing, military, medical, and consumer products. The next-generation 6.X nm wavelength lithography will extend Moore?s law and the growth of the semiconductor industry into the next decade. This project will address both the development of plasma-based light sources at 6.X nm to print integrated circuits, as well as the development of compact light sources to address challenges associated with nano-metrology. This project will also accelerate technology transfer by enabling the realization of new light sources to print and characterize integrated circuit features of smaller dimension, resulting in the creation of new jobs in the semiconductor and laser industry, and in high value semiconductor manufacturing equipment products. The partnership engaged to accelerate the transfer of the technologies to the market domain includes the NSF Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology, the University of California at San Diego with extensive expertise in EUV technology, and Cymer Inc., a leader in light sources for lithography, that plans to commercialize the 6.X nm wavelength integrated circuit printing technology. The potential economic impact of extending lithography to smaller dimensions is enormous. The semiconductor industry is a key driver of the U.S. economy. The lithography process is the single most critical and capital intensive part of the semiconductor manufacturing process and as such will significantly contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor equipment market. Lithographic processing and metrology equipment accounts for ~50% of capital equipment cost in U.S. and foreign semiconductor facilities. The societal impact includes jobs in the high technology sector and contributions to an increased standard of living and lifespan world-wide. The proposed academic/industry ecosystem will also allow for the creation of a unique environment to educate and train the workforce necessary to maintain the US competitiveness in this area critical to the nation?s economy.",
