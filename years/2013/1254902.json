 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a technology that allows direct measurement of the carrier-envelope phase of ultrafast pulses using semiconductor devices.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: First, the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of ultrafast pulses is considered an absolute phase of light as its definition is independent of a second light wave. Finding a low-cost approach to measure CEP would allow this fundamental parameter become widely accessible, hence opening up a new dimension in optical information processing, optical sensing and precision metrology. Second, CEP control is an enabling technology for the emerging atto-science and zepto-science. Accessing such short time scales requires the use of intense few-cycle infrared pulses with precisely tailored field patterns. Such a feat cannot be accomplished without a reliable method to probe the CEP. Current CEP-detection techniques, however, are prohibitively complex and expensive. The proposed research exploits the excellent coherence features offered by semiconductor nanoparticles and aims to develop a semiconductor-based CEP-probing scheme with possible electronic readout, which may eventually open up the access to the atto-second world for most of the researchers around the world.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts are: (1) creating a new research thrust of ultrafast dynamics in semiconductors at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, (2) strengthening the integration of research and education by supporting extracurricular student optics club activities, and (3) building an optics education hub in the northern Alabama region through close collaboration with local optics/photonics professional societies and through a wide range of outreach activities.",

The long-term goal is to develop a research thrust on ultrafast spectroscopy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, with an effective integration of research and education.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the major scientific findings and achievements of the project:</p>\n<p>(1) We have developed a powerful new ultrafast-spectroscopy technique called <strong>few-cycle pump-probe reflectometry</strong> (PPR). The method can perform time-domain and spectral-domain measurements simultaneously, and can achieve a 10-fs temporal resolution over a 300-nm of spectral range. Furthermore, the system does not require the use of optical amplifier, making it both compact and cost-effective. Using this technique, we have reported the first 2D time-frequency spectroscopy of the transient dispersion of GaAs near its band gap. Our result shows that, even for a material as well studied as GaAs, few-cycle PPR can offer new insight into the ultrafast carrier dynamics.</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;The versatile pump-probe system developed in this project has also allowed us to collaborate with device developers to <strong>study ultrafast properties of novel optoelectronic devices</strong>, such as GaAs/AlGaAs photocathodes and GaN nanowire photocathodes. These devices have attracted a lot of interest recently due to their potential applications under low-light environments. We have made the first pre-photoemission study of photoelectron dynamics in such devices. The unique features of our PPR system allow us to evaluate device parameters such as diffusion coefficient and quantum efficiency more effectively and precisely. This research potentially opens up a completely new avenue toward optoelectronic device characterization.</p>\n<p>(3) Coherent control of quantum states with sequential optical pulses has attracted a lot of interest in recent years because of its potential applications in quantum computing and quantum communication. We have made the first study on <strong>coherent control with few-cycle pulse pairs </strong>and have discovered some interesting effects caused by the CEPs of the pulses. These findings lead to a new concept of coherent control based on the relative phases of pulse pairs. Its low power requirement offers a clear advantage over the single-pulse schemes, and its broadband nature results in improved wavelength flexibility when compared to the traditional method based on pulse area.</p>\n<p>(4) Time-stretch spectroscopy has established as a viable technique with high resolution and single-shot capability. Combining time-stretch spectroscopy and the concept of ultrafast optical sampling, we have proposed and demonstrated a new spectroscopic method called <strong>Time-Wavelength Optical Sampling (TWOS)</strong>. The technique leverages the simplicity of time-stretch method and the dynamic flexibility of ultrafast optical sampling to offer a simple but effective scheme for real-time spectroscopy. It is capable of achieving real-time (150-Hz updating rate) measurement with high spectral resolution (sub-GHz) without the need for high-speed photodetectors and complicated amplification systems.</p>\n<p>(5) We have developed <strong>an acid-free sol-gel technique</strong>, which proves to be both simple and effective in fabricating silica glass thin films embedded with II-VI colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Octadecylamine (ODA) ligands are used as a <strong>bi-functional aid</strong> to not only stabilize the QDs in solution but also assist the formation of the SiO<sub>2</sub> gel. We have demonstrated that high-quality QD-embedded glass thin films can be developed with this technique. This method offers a fast and low-cost path toward thin-film QD sensors with good mechanical and thermal stabilities, which are desirable for applications involving highly focused laser beams such as ultrafast nanophotonics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are the major educational and infrastructural outcomes of the project:</p>\n<p>(1) Overall, the project has produced <strong><em>2</em></strong> Ph.D. dissertations, <strong><em>1</em></strong> M.S. thesis, <strong><em>2</em></strong> pending patents, <strong><em>19</em></strong> journal publications, and <strong><em>15</em></strong> refereed conference papers. The results and data have been disseminated through publications, conferences, invited talks, lectures, and websites.</p>\n<p>(2) Overall, the grant has partially funded <strong><em>7</em></strong> graduate students for their research activities, conference trips, and publications. It has also funded <strong><em>1</em></strong> REU project, <strong><em>3</em></strong> undergraduate summer projects, <strong><em>13</em></strong> capstone research projects (PH499). These students include <strong><em>1</em></strong> minority and <strong><em>7 </em></strong>females. Students funded by this grant have won such prestigious award as SPIE Photonics Scholarship and Alabama GRSP Fellowship. Many have become professionals in the field of optics.</p>\n<p>(2) An integrated part of this CAREER project is the establishment of the UAH Society of Optics Students (SOS). Under Dr. Duan's supervision, SOS has seen a steady growth in membership and activities over the last 5 years. The club currently has over 30 registered members and its own lab.
