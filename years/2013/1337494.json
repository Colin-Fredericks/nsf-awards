 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Robert Paley from Swarthmore College and colleagues Liliya Yatsunyk, Kathleen Howard and Stephen Miller will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) diastereoselective spirocyclizations directed by planar chiral metal carbonyl complexes; (b) interaction of G-quadruplex DNA with small molecule ligands; (c) application of NMR methods to elucidate how an integral membrane protein induces curvature in cholesterol containing membrane bilayers; and (d) studies of interspecies quorum sensing signal processing proteins.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at Swarthmore College but also at collaborating institutions such as Ursinus College, LaSalle University, Saint Peter's University. The instrumentation will also impact some industrial collaborators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award enabled the acquisition and installation of a modern 400 MHz FT-NMR (Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectrometer for the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at Swarthmore College.  The new spectrometer, equipped with an autosampler and automation software, replaced an aging instrument and has facilitated and strengthened faculty research programs and hands-on access by undergraduate students in research training as well as in the laboratory curriculum.\n\nNMR spectroscopy is an essential tool for elucidating and characterizing molecular structure and thus plays a vital role in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry.  Its utility in the monitoring of molecular dynamics in solution also makes NMR spectroscopy an important tool in biochemical research.  Faculty at Swarthmore have utilized the new spectrometer to advance their research programs in the synthesis of enantiomerically pure planar chiral iron(0) tricarbonyl diene complexes, to prepare new porphyrin-based ligands to be tested for binding to G-quadruplexes, and to monitor structural changes of the universal bacterial quorum sensing signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2) and its phosphorylated derivative.  Four students (three female) trained on the instrument are now in chemistry/biochemistry graduate programs at top research universities.  A total of 46 students (Chemistry/Biochemistry majors and minors) have had hands-on access to the instrument has part of advanced laboratory work in physical and inorganic chemistry courses.  Another 56 students - prospective majors/minors and pre-medical students (including those who are non-science majors) will access the spectrometer in the current semester (Fall, 2016) in the organic chemistry laboratory.  The autosampler and automation software are vital features enabling the integration of the spectrometer into the laboratory curriculum during the current and future years of the Department?s course offerings.\n\nThe new spectrometer has been utilized for research projects by faculty at Haverford College and at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, and has played an important role in successfully recruiting a new faculty member (specializing in inorganic synthesis) to join our department.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert S Paley"
