Dr. Julian Christou (Large Binocular Telescope Observatory) and Dr. Donald Miller (Indiana University) are cochairs.  The emphasis will be on synergies between methods developed and used by various communities pursuing different applications, and a special interest will be exploring ways to address current limitations in adaptive optics systems and novel applications.  A number of internationally-known invited speakers will be participating.  Partial funding for this activity is being provided by NSF?s Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",
