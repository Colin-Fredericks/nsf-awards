 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses questions concerning the regularity of and the analysis of singularities of solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations, primarily in connection with more complex problems in differential geometry. A significant part of this project is devoted to the understanding of global-in-time solutions to geometric flows such as the Ricci flow, the Yamabe flow, and the mean curvature flow, and the related problem of the classification of associated singularities and solitons. Other projects include free boundary problems arising from the mathematics of finance, the qualitative behavior to solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations, and the study of the Ricci flow on Lorentzian manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular, nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry, and classical analysis. The principal investigator intends to study the applications of the mathematical problems to other disciplines such as quantum field theory, relativity theory, and mathematical finance. Results will be disseminated to the research community at various meetings and by publication of research articles. New courses linking partial differential equations and geometric analysis for graduate students will be designed and implemented.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSome of the most important problems  in mathematics and physics   are related to the understanding of  singularities. This could vary  from the understanding  of black holes   or turbulence to the accumulation  of cancer cells.  These physical phenomena are often described via a differential equation which involves time and space. Studying  the qualitative behavior of the solutions of  such equations  often results to a better   understanding of the related physical  problem.\n\nTo capture a singularity one uses   a   blow up   procedure  which allows  to focus near the potential singularity and uses the scaling properties of the differential equation involves. Because of the change in  the scaling of  space and time, the new solution, after the blow up,  is defined for all space and time, in other words it is  a \"global solution\". The   classification of such solutions,  when possible,  almost always  sheds  new insight to the  singularity analysis and  the related  physical problem.  \n\nIn this project the PI  addressed the  questions of  existence, uniqueness and  qualitative behavior of  global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Emphasis was  given to the classification of ancient solutions, the construction of new ancient solutions from the gluing of special solutions called \"solitons\" and  to the study of fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows in the complete non compact case. The interplay between analytical and geometric techniques  was  crucial for the research outcomes. \n\nThe  project linked  a wide range of active fields of mathematics,  in particular  nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and classical analysis.\n\nThe results were disseminated to the research community at various meetings and by publication of research articles.  Also though graduate courses, attended by graduate students, postdoctoral researches and also advanded  undergraduate students.
