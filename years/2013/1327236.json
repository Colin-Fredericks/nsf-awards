The workshop brings researchers and practitioners from multiple disciplines (computer vision, neuroscience, multimedia computing, sensor technologies and assistive technology applications) to discuss fundamental issues in visual perception, computational intelligence, neuroscience and visual prosthesis for helping blind and visually impaired people and people working in visually challenged environments. The workshop papers are included along with the IEEE ICME 2013 proceedings. The workshop homepage is used to disseminate results of the panel discussions and paper presentations as well as the report.",
