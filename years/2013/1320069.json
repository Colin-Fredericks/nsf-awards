 "awd_abstract_narration": "As society becomes increasingly reliant on software systems to help\r\nplan medical treatments, predict the future climate, guide investments\r\nin financial markets, and mine noisy data to infer scientific facts,\r\nthe risk that uncertainties in the input data and defects in the\r\nsoftware can create false alarms, or a false sense of security, is\r\nhigh. This project will help address the gap between highly complex\r\nprobabilistic programs and tools for reasoning about them.\r\nProbabilistic programs arise in important everyday applications that\r\ninclude medical, engineering and financial risk analysis/decision\r\nmaking systems, large-scale simulations, data mining, sensor noise\r\nfiltering algorithms for cyber-physical systems, and randomized\r\nalgorithms. The presence of input uncertainties and randomness built\r\ninto the behavior of the programs can cause undesirable behaviors and\r\nvariable performance.  Therefore, it is important to accurately\r\npredict the probabilities of such undesirable behaviors, and expected\r\nvalues for important performance measures.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates automatic program analysis tools for\r\nprobabilistic programs that will model the sources of uncertainty\r\nappropriately, and infer bounds on the probabilities of assertions and\r\nexpectations of performance measures. Two flavors of inference\r\nprocedures are being investigated: symbolic procedures\r\ncombining decision procedures with the theory of martingales and\r\nstatistical procedures using statistical hypothesis testing\r\nmethods to infer probabilistic annotations with statistical\r\nguarantees.",
