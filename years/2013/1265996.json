 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposal is  concerned  with   the  dimension of a  measure associated with a positive  solution to the  p  Laplace equation, often called a  p harmonic function,  which  vanishes  continuously on the boundary of  a domain and related problems. If  p is two  the  p  Laplace equation reduces to  Laplace's equation and the Green's  function for Laplace's equation,  with pole at a fixed point in the domain, gives harmonic measure.  This measure  has had numerous  applications in   Potential  Theory and  applied areas throughout the twentieth century.  In the mid 1980's   mathematicians began to study the Hausdorff  dimension of  harmonic measure.    In an important paper,    Makarov   proved that harmonic measure in simply connected planar domains always has dimension one.  Jones and  Wolf  showed that the dimension of this measure is always  less than or equal to one in any planar domain.  The proposer has  obtained  endpoint type analogues of  Makarov's work  for  p  harmonic  measures, when p is between one  and  infinity.  In this proposal  he discusses possible techniques  for studying p harmonic measures in   arbitrary planar domains  and  also  in  certain  domains in  higher dimensional Euclidean space.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Laplace's  equation  was  used widely throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to explain physical processes. Its nonlinear cousin, the p Laplacian, has only  recently  found applications in mathematical modeling (glacier formation, image processing) perhaps  because this PDE  is difficult to work with.  The  PI's work with coauthors  gives the p Laplacian strong visibility in an  area  previously  reserved for the Laplacian.The PI and coauthors have  developed a  p harmonic toolbox which  enabled  them to make significant progress on problems previously considered solvable only  for Laplace's equation.     The PI believes that the techniques, results, and  problems discussed in his proposal  will   play an important role in popularizing the p Laplacian and  also  have applications in mathematical modeling. These  problems - techniques  involve a nice mixture of  harmonic analysis,  complex function theory, and partial differential equations, so should be attractive to researchers and  graduate students in  a  wide  area of  mathematical and  applied analysis.",
