 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johnson C. Smith University, a minority-serving institution, will create a Shared Instrumentation Research Laboratory (SIRL) that will provide cutting edge equipment for chemistry and biology research.  The new instrumentation will be located in the new 65,000-square foot Science Center on the campus in North Carolina.   A certification program will ensure that faculty and students are masters in the use of the instrumentation.\r\nResearchers at the institution will provide outreach to high school teachers to teach and collaborate on research projects using the instrumentation.   In addition, the STEM conference planned for 2014 will incorporate faculty and student research at the college and high school level.   Incentives for new research ideas and collaborations are stimulated by the availability of mini-grant seed funding.  Stakeholders from higher education, K-12,  community colleges and the private sector will provide advisory assistance for continuous improvement of the project over the three-year duration of the project. \r\nCurrent research indicates that students who have hand-on exposure to instrumentation are better prepared for direct entry into continuing STEM graduate studies or the STEM workforce.  Both formative and summative evaluation will be conducted to inform research and practice on student achievement in STEM disciplines.  Research questions to be examined from this project, for example, include whether student achievement in Analytical Chemistry and Instrumental Analysis changed as measured using the American Chemical Society (ACS) exams?",

The SIRL is located in the new Science Center at JCSU, which was occupied in Fall 2015.  The delayed completion of this building delayed the implementation of this program.\n\nAlong with these instruments, the Analytical and Instrumental Analysis series of course and labs were revised (going from 8 credit hours to 10 credit hours) to use the new instruments.  Faculty developed and implemented a new Forensic Science course, offered for the first time in Fall 2017.  A Chemical Biology course has also been developed but not yet offered.  Several faculty research projects have been supported by this program. \n\nJCSU students have to complete a Senior Investigative Paper as a graduation requirement.  Students in Natural Sciences have the option of a research based paper, a computational or theoretical paper, or a literature based paper.  These instruments make it much more feasible for students and faculty to engage in lab-based research.  While only one year of the post implementation data are available, it is a significant achievement of this program that there was a dramatic increase in the use of these instruments in student Senior Investigative Papers (4 % prior to the program; 19% after).\n\nOngoing challenges exist to the sustained impact of the program after the funding has ended exist.  For example, funding for maintenance of the instruments (an annual maintenance contract on the GC/MS is almost 1700% of the department?s annual budget for lab supplies.  The minimum supply of helium gas required for operation of the GC/MS is about 60% of the annual budget.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy D Champion"
