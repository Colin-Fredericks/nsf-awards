The PIs will test the hypothesis that scaffolding cyber-enabled collaborative learning can promote shared construction of knowledge and regulation of learning processes for African American students and, thus, lead to improvement of their deeper understanding of important concepts and higher-order skill development.\r\n\r\nThe project will expand the current knowledge about cyber-enabled collaborative learning by conducting the research in a STEM context, particularly examining the effects of instructional guides in an authentic STEM education setting for African American students.  Prior research on collaborative learning was conducted mainly on K-12 students or liberal arts college students. The study could add new perspectives in instructional strategies for STEM faculty to increase student engagement and persistence and improve academic performance in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.",
