 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Liming Zhang of Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, aims to study the reactivities of two novel and reactive gold intermediates, gold vinylidene and gold aryne complex, and develop versatile reactions based on them that would be operationally simple, high yielding, and robust and offer unique/unprecedented access to important new skeletons. These procedures will be used in the synthesis of highly complex natural and unnatural products such as polycyclic hydrocarbons and heterocycles. Successful implementation of these strategies will provide for the rapid assembly of a variety of polycyclic systems, including some less commonly found in the chemical literature. Ready access to privileged ligand frameworks may also be achieved. \r\nSuccessful outcomes should have an impact on any area of chemical activity where the syntheses of novel molecules are needed, such as in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries. Moreover, the project promises to provide excellent training vehicles of students at all levels, including those from historically underrepresented groups.",
