Another goal of the proposal is to classify the asymptotic behavior of complete embedded constant mean curvature surfaces of finite topology in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and more generally, in homogeneous three-manifolds. Theoretical techniques concerning removable singularities, compactness, regularity and convergence of sequences of embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces will be investigated as well.

Physically minimal surfaces can be modeled as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area relative to their boundaries; physically constant mean curvature surfaces can be modeled as soap films on wires with a constant pressure difference on each side. Minimal surfaces play an important role as a tool in the study of three-dimensional topology and geometry.
