 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jason Bennett at Penn State University, Erie, Professor Eva Zurek at SUNY Buffalo, and their groups will be studying electrodeposited dicyano-ferriprotoporphyrin as an electrocatalyst capable of selectively oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the body while in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), two known interferences. Selective in vivo detection of H2S is important for understanding the molecule's physiological and pathological roles, specifically with regard to understanding various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  This project is expected to result in a strategy for modifying an electrode with a material capable of selective H2S detection that can be incorporated into a future amperometric sensor capable of real-time in vivo measurements. The gained knowledge will hopefully lead to improved understanding and subsequently better treatments for neurological diseases.  \r\n \r\nTo accomplish this goal, the electrodeposition process of the porphyrin molecule onto an electrode surface and its subsequent interactions with H2S, CO and NO will be investigated using a variety of electrochemical, microscopic, and computational methods of analysis.  These studies will allow for the optimization of the material for future incorporation into an H2S gas sensor.  Additionally, this research will expand computation methods that will improve the general understanding of electrocatalytic reactions.  Undergraduate research students will be involved in all facets of this project to further integrate year-round research into their education experiences concurrent with the NSF mission and objectives of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  The collaboration between Dr. Bennett at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) and Dr. Zurek at a large research institution will both broaden the experience of the undergraduate researchers at PUI, allowing them to conduct research at a large university, as well as provide training to one of Dr. Zurek's graduate students on how to effectively mentor undergraduate research students and prepare him/her for a future teaching position at a PUI.",
