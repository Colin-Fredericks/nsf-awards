CIMA consists of five Hispanic Serving Institutions in Texas led by the only college in the nation with both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Historically Black Colleges and Universities designation. The CIMA project will broaden participation of minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by involving at least 900 underrepresented minorities (URM) STEM majors in CIMA activities, increasing minority STEM student enrollment by as least 10 percent and increasing the successful transfer of community college into STEM majors at 4-year institutions by 20 percent from baseline. \r\n\r\nThe CIMA Alliance will provide: undergraduate research; peer mentorship; faculty mentorship; tutoring; Supplemental Instruction (SI) especially in math; STEM student academic development; STEM student clubs; faculty professional development for advising for STEM pathways and teaching best practices; training for college recruiters, advisors and developmental math teachers to improve recruitment of underrepresented minorities into STEM; and development of additional STEM articulation agreements.",
