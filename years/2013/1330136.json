 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innovation presented in this proposal is a new paradigm for capturing critical quality information at the point-of-care using advanced technologies in an intuitive workflow. Healthcare quality and cost represent top national priorities. An increasingly common strategy to improve outcomes and value of care is performance assessment to promote best practices. Over decades, the most successful quality improvement (QI) programs have been heavily data-reliant. These programs require identifying patients that fit specific quality measures and assuring their care meets national guidelines. Linking patients to quality measures is the rate limiting step, involving an overwhelming amount of manual labor to review narrative notes one at a time and link them to an appropriate subset of hundreds of known quality measures. Leveraging a robust platform proven in Phase I, the proposed Phase II solution offers an automated approach to capturing a set of quality measures in real-time. The output will provide rich and compliant documentation enhanced with quality measures that feed the electronic health record (EHR) and downstream clinical, operational, and financial hospital systems through standard protocols. The goal is a disruptive change that will fast-track national initiatives and enable a safer and more efficient healthcare system.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this program is to further national healthcare goals of reducing cost and improving quality in care. The approach leverages increased breadth, depth, and accuracy of patient data captured at the point of care. The most aggressive national initiatives encourage capturing a small portion of the hundreds of known quality measures. Accelerating capture and use of quality measures is an opportunity to meaningfully improve a healthcare system that lags in quality and cost. Impact must also be considered at a personal level. There is a cost to care within a system where quality is not documented and tracked. A typical example out of the hundreds of defined measures is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Multiple studies on manual programs to document VAP and leverage care algorithms demonstrate greater than 40% reduction in mortality and 20% reduction in cost. VAP, though common, did not make the top 15 list of measures required by the government in 2014 because it is too difficult to capture. There is currently no automated approach to capture this quality measure. Addressing technical limitations in documenting quality measures will expand QI reach and save lives.",

As a full risk provider group, Customer had a well defined process for risk adjustment coding. Customer was interested in realizing incremental coding efficiency by implementing the Health Fidelity solution. The impact was expected to be relatively small due to the well-managed risk adjustment processes of Customer.\nImplementation and Methodology\n\nCustomer used Health Fidelity\u00c6s solution to code 500 Medicare Advantage members for 2015 dates of service, prior to the March 2016 CMS submission.\n\nCustomer provided clinical documents, drawn from a representative set, via an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Customer\u00c6s coders had already reviewed these dociments. Health Fidelity\u00c6s solution ingested the clinical documents. Three Customer coders used the solution for incremental risk adjustment coding.\nResults\nCoding Accuracy and Revenue Capture\n\nCustomer\u00c6s coders identified 89 ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the clinical documents. This translated to 39 incremental HCC codes and $118,019 of incremental annual risk-adjusted reimbursement. This is an additional $236 Per Member Per Year (PMPY).\nWorkflow Efficiency\n\nTotal data consisted of 4,452 clinical documents across all 500 members. However, based on the solution only 300 clinical documents across 136 members needed to be presented to coders. This represented a 93% reduction in the number of documents needing review. With the help of Health Fidelity\u00c6s workflow, Customer\u00c6s team of only three coders was able to complete its coding at a remarkable pace of 11.1 members per hour. This contrasts with an average of 3 members per hour in the absence of the Health Fidelity solution.\nCommercialization\n\nThe work undertaken as part of this grant led to the creation of core backend capabilities in processing clinical data, as well as end-user facing applications that are used by our customers\u00c6 personnel. This section describes the technology development as well as commercialization.\nChange in Direction\n\nHealth Fidelity responded to changing market dynamics and redirected the focus of the work towards Value-based Healthcare based on CMS-HCC. This change in direction was reviewed and approved by the NSF in March 2015. Health Fidelity leveraged the work done under NLP Enhancements and Inference Engine development and applied this towards innovative user experienc..."
