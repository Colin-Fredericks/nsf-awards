 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carnivores (bears, wolves, lions, seals and relatives) are key predators in modern ecosystems. Understanding their evolutionary relationships is fundamental to interpreting other knowledge (biological, medical, ecological) derived from carnivore research. By developing the most comprehensive framework for interrelationships of living and fossil carnivores (>100 species) using 400 anatomical and over 30,000 genetic characteristics, and integrating novel 3-D imaging, mathematical, and engineering-derived computer modeling tools, this research will reconstruct carnivore evolutionary relationships and decipher their adaptations for critical ecosystem roles over time.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing how feeding function of skulls changed over time, and how species developed locomotion and cognitive specializations during major habitat transitions (land-to-water, tree-to-ground), this research will rigorously test previous hypotheses that these changes represent responses to significant environmental changes over the past 65 million years. This project will use cutting-edge research on these charismatic mammals to enrich museum exhibitions and create online multimedia (serving 5 million visitors [500,000 schoolchildren] and 12 million online learners annually).  This project will also implement high school and college education and research training programs, including workshops, development of new graduate courses, training for three postdoctoral scientists, and instructional programs for dozens of high school students and undergraduate students.",
