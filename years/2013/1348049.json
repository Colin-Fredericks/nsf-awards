 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EAGER proposal is to design, theoretically model, and experimentally demonstrate a novel class of large-area ultra-thin metasurfaces based on intersubband polaritons with giant nonlinear optical response, orders of magnitude larger than any device reported so far in the scientific literature. Proof-of-concept demonstration efforts will focus on development highly-efficient second harmonic generation mirrors in the mid-infrared regime. The proposed concept is, however, much broader and can be readily extended to other nonlinear optical phenomena.\r\nIntellectual Merits: The proposed research will introduce novel concepts in nonlinear optics and in metamaterial technology. For the first time, nonlinear response of intersubband excitations strongly coupled to optical modes in metal-dielectric-metal microcavities will be investigated. Already giant intersubband optical nonlinearities in coupled-quantum-wells systems can be further boosted by coupling intersubband transitions with ad-hoc engineered resonant modes in metal-dielectric-metal metamaterial cavities. \r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research combines elements of metamaterial theory, optoelectronics, nonlinear optics, and semiconductor physics. This combination offers a rich, interdisciplinary educational environment for graduate and undergraduate students. Knowledge and techniques developed during our research efforts will be incorporated into focused graduate-level courses currently taught by the PI and Co-PI. The metasurfaces developed in this project are expected to find numerous industrial applications. The PI will continue his annual participation in the NNIN REU program with students involved in the proposed research and involve the co-PI in this effort. At the K-12 level, PI and co-PI will collaborate with NSF-sponsored UTeachEngineering program.",
