 "awd_abstract_narration": "At present, there are several public efforts under way to generate massive data sets\r\nderived from all available cancer tissues. Such data is already available for four forms of cancer: Ovarian,\r\nlung, breast and colon, and more are on the way. One of the characteristics of these data sets is that the\r\nnumber of features that are measured is in the tens of thousands, while the number of tissue samples for\r\neach form of cancer is in the hundreds. The main challenge therefore is to extract the most informative features\r\nthat can be used to distinguish one set of cancer patients from another, for example, those that respond to a\r\nparticular form of therapy from those who do not. Such features, referred to as biomarkers, can then be used\r\nto develop therapies that are customized to focused groups or even individual patients. However, almost\r\nall available algorithms for extracting relevant features from big data sets face a \"barrier\" in that the number\r\nof features extracted is bounded below by the number of training samples. This number, which might be\r\nin the hundreds, is far too large to be useful in biological applications. In this project, it is proposed to\r\ndevelop some novel algorithms for feature extraction that can break through this \"barrier\" and identify far\r\nfewer features than the number of training samples. These newly developed algorithms will be analyzed\r\nin terms of their statistical behavior and their optimality; in addition they will be validated on actual data\r\nsets from lung, ovarian and endometrial cancer.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of current cancer therapy is the widespread acceptance of the need to use\r\nmulti-drug combinations. This is because when a patient is treated with a single drug, almost invariably\r\nthe tumor will grow back even if it shrinks initially, and the relapsed tumor is often resistant to the drug.\r\nDue to combinatorial explosion, it is not feasible to try out all possible combinations of drugs in experimental\r\nsettings. Moreover, due to the complexity of the behavior of cancer cells, it is also not possible\r\nto develop analytical models for the mechanisms of action of multiple drugs used in combination. It is\r\ntherefore imperative to develop methodologies for predicting the efficacy of multi-drug combinations while\r\nmaking almost no assumptions about the mechanism of action of each drug. In this project, it is proposed to use\r\nthe so-called \"maximum entropy method\" to develop such a prediction methodology. The maximum entropy\r\nmethod was developed about fifty years in the context of deriving equilibrium statistical mechanics\r\nfrom information theory, and is widely accepted as one of the best methods to be used when it is desired to\r\nminimize the number of a priori assumptions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Currently available algorithms for classification and regression such as LASSO, elastic\r\nnet, and Dantzig have the feature that the number of key features extracted is roughly equal to the number\r\nof training samples. However, even this number is too large to be of practical use in biological situations.\r\nPreliminary investigations on a new algorithm invented by the PI show that it does not have this limitation.\r\nMoreover, this new algorithm has shown promising performance on two types of cancer data sets:\r\nendometrial and ovarian. If a sound theoretical foundation can be established for the observed behavior of\r\nthis algorithm, as well as for another that is still in the conceptual stage, that would be a very significant\r\ncontribution to statistics and to machine learning theory. On another front, if it can be established through\r\ntheory and experiment that the maximum entropy method can be used to predict the efficacy of multi-drug\r\ncombinations, that would greatly advance both the theory of the method and the practical applicability of\r\nmulti-drug therapy.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the USA, in other industrialized countries,\r\nand also in newly industrializing countries. It is widely accepted that cancer is the most \"individual\" of diseases\r\nin that no two manifestations are alike. Therefore personalized therapy is the way forward. However,\r\nthere are very few methodologies for developing personal therapy that are agnostic as to the type of cancer.\r\nThe present project aims to develop precisely such methodologies. Given the large mindshare of cancer in\r\nthe scientific community and in society at large, it can be safely assumed that if the project is successfully\r\ncompleted, then the research findings would be followed up by the cancer researcher community. To hasten\r\nthe process, the PI will work with several cancer researchers in the UT Southwestern Medical Center in\r\nDallas and in the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\r\n\r\nThe project will entail the training of two graduate students and at least one undergraduate summer\r\nintern per year. This would serve to increase the pool of trained manpower and also to disseminate the\r\nanalytical approach to cancer therapy design to a broader audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTCancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S.A. and also worldwide.  The major challenge in treating cancer is the bewildering variety of cancer manifestations.  Therefore personalized medicine (nowadays referred to as \"precision medicine\") is not only desirable but imperative.\n\nThe project had two objectives:\n\nThe first objective was to find computational procedures to group cancer patients into two or more groups, such that patients within each group would respond similarly to a particular therapy.  In this anner, it would be possible to tailor the therapy to the particular patient (or patient group).  We achieved this and demonstrated this in two forms of female cancers, namely endometrial (cancer of the lining of the uterus) and ovarian.  In the case of endometrial caner, our method could accurately predict whether a woman was at risk of \"mtastasis,\" that is, the cancer spreading beyond the original site.  Current guidelines on what surgery is to be performed showed that 78% of the surgeries involed needless removal of pelvic lymph nodes even though they were not metastatic.  Our method correctly identified metastatic patients with 100% accuracy on a training sample of 86 patients.  On an independent test sample of 28 patients, our method achieved a p-value of 0.004, meaning that the likelihood of random guessing achieving the same accuracy as our method was just 0.004, or 0.4%.  This method is now at a stage where the gynecological oncology community can test it further, and eventually, use it as a standard practice.  In the case of ovarian cancer, we could predict which patients would respond poorly to standard frontline therapy, which is platinum-based chemotherapy.  If it can be accurately predicted that a patient would not respond to such therapy, then she could immediately be switched to secondary therapy, thereby saving valuable time, and enhancing the prospects of complete recovery.\n\nThe second objective of the project was to predict the efficacy of multiple drug combinations in cancer therapy.  In general, a cancerous tumor is not a homogenous collection of cells, and contains a lot of different mutations.  To enhance the likelihood of success, the physician would administer two (and very rarely more than two) drugs at a time.  There are now about 500 potential cancer drugs that are being tested in various research laboratories around the world, leading to about 25,000 pairs of drug combinations.  Clearly it is not possible test all posslble drug combinations to assess their efficacy.  In this project, we have developed a method for predicting the efficacy of all drug combinations, based just a few combinations.  For example, it is possible to predict the efficacy of all 25,000 or so drug pairs, based on as few as 500 pairs of drugs.  This methodology can now be tested by clinicians.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mathukumalli Vidyasagar"
