SEAM 2013 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring plenary speakers who will address the following topics: operator theory (Anna Skripka), mathematical physics (Fritz Gesztesy), harmonic analysis on fractals and associated wavelet and multiscale analysis (Palle Jorgensen), free noncommutative analysis (Dmitry Kaliuzhnyi-Verbovetskyi). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
