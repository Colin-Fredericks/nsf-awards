 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the primary instructional responsibilities of any physics department is to teach basic physics to students who are pursuing majors in the life sciences. However, the course sequence offered to life science students is typically not designed to serve their needs but is rather a version (often watered-down) of one designed to serve the needs of physics, mathematics, and engineering students. As noted in the BIO2010 report of the National Research Council, the basic physics knowledge needed to build an understanding of biology is often absent from such courses or may not be covered in depth. \r\n\r\nThis project at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill addresses this concern directly, providing life-science students with a physics course designed with their discipline in mind, using the research-validated pedagogical techniques of the lecture/studio model to maximize student engagement. The project is creating an introductory course sequence for life science majors with content and pedagogy designed to improve the students' grasp of physics concepts and their understanding of the concepts' relevance to biology, as well as to improve their ability to apply those concepts to the solution of complex problems. This partnership between the Physics & Astronomy and Biology Departments adopts a \"how things work\" approach and a lecture/studio model for the courses, in which each unit begins with a biological \"driving question\" and incorporates the physics concepts necessary to understand it. \r\n\r\nAnother goal of this work is the development of the local learning community of instructors to foster the use of research-based pedagogies in large introductory science classes in physics and biology. This collaboration across disciplines in teaching leads to improvement in the effectiveness of the instructors' teaching in other courses, and provides a model for interdisciplinary collaborations for pedagogical reforms for other institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUndergraduate students of the life sciences are typically required to take two semesters of introductory physics as part of their programs of study.  Unfortunately, the content of many of these physics courses is not well-matched to needs of many life-science students, nor are the courses often taught using research-validated pedagogy.  In this project (\"Physics and Biology Partnership for a New Learning Environment\"), physics and biology faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have collaborated to reimagine the content of these physics courses and to transform how they are taught by utilizing the latest findings from discipline-based education research.  As a result of this work, we have\n\ntransformed the structure of the introductory physics class for life-science students to maximize the time that students are actively engaged in thinking about authentic applications of physics to the life sciences;  \n\n\ndeveloped over 50 new active-engagement activities that contain a mix of experiments, conceptual tutorials, and context-rich problem-solving;\nsignificantly improved students? learning of key physics concepts, as measured by nationally-validated concept inventories and surveys.\n\n\nTo date, these revised courses have enrolled over 4000 students, many of whom intend to pursue careers in medicine, public health, dentistry, and other health-related fields.  The broader impact of this work will be felt by the members of the general public who will someday become patients of these students.  We have also trained multiple faculty members in the effective implementation of active-learning strategies used in these courses.  These faculty include 6 at UNC-Chapel Hill plus another 27 that have participated in our professional development workshops at two meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers.  Many of these faculty incorporate the materials and the techniques they have learned from us in other courses they teach, which extends the impact of the project beyond the courses and students it directly affects.  Active learning strategies are becoming pervasive in science courses throughout the UNC campus, and the Physics &amp; Astronomy Department has been a leader in that effort for a decade.  This project served to increase campus collaboration as faculty members from different departments shared their struggles and successes in implementing research-based pedagogical methodologies. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laurie E Mcneil"
