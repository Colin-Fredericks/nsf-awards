 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Scott Gronert of Virginia Commonwealth University for the study of organic reaction processes in the gas phase.  Using an ion trap mass spectrometer with variable temperature capabilities, fundamental processes such as the competition between SN2 and E2 reactions as well chiral recognition are examined.  Also, the mechanisms and reactivity of synthetically important organometallic species, including copper and gold carbenes, are being investigated. Third, the reactivity of aryl halides with nucleophiles is being explored.  Preliminary work indicates competition between several pathways including an unusual SN2 reaction on a halogen center.  The rationale for this work is that gas-phase studies allow one to probe the bonding characteristics of specific, isolated intermediates and gain mechanistic information that is not readily available from experiments using conventional techniques.\r\n  \r\nThe information gained from this research can be very valuable in the development of more effective chemical processes in the synthesis of new materials or the remediation of hazardous materials.  The grant also focuses on developing new scientists and is designed to offer many research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.  As a part of an outreach program, students from local historically black universities (Virginia State and Virginia Union) are recruited to participate in summer research.",
