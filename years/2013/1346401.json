 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports graduate and postdoctoral student participation from US universities, national labs, and non-profit research organizations to attend the 22nd International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) Conference be held in October 2013 in Orlando, FL. IMR created in 1992 is a unique conference for researchers in the field of mesh generation to exchange ideas and is also an excellent educational opportunity for students who are working on the meshing research and related applications. Potential topics for discussion in the conference include: mesh generation and modification, meshing for high-performance and distributed computing, CAD and computational geometry issues, and applications of meshing in computer graphics, finite-element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, biomedical engineering, processing of laser/CT/MRI scans, etc.\r\nStudents have the opportunity to attend a short course in meshing where the lecturers are internationally known experts in mesh generation. The instructors address practical problems for the design and implementation of both unstructured and structured grid generation. The course is ideal for graduate students that just enter the field and for advance graduate and postdoctoral students that want to expand their current skills and knowledge.\r\nThe workshop provides a forum to foster discussions mesh generation and will enable the identification of areas of common interest and potential collaboration among attendees from academia, National Laboratories, and industry. Priority will be given to students/postdocs presenting a paper or poster at the conference. The PI plans  to diversify the accepted attendees' pool and attract underrepresented groups.",
