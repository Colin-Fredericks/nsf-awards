 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monodispersed (uniform size) magnetic nanocrystals have been successfully applied in high energy density magnet, data storage and biotechnology applications. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve the ordered structure needed in a large scale due to different types of planar defects in the nanocrystals. The objective of this project is to produce and study metastable, epitaxially stabilized rare-earth-free magnetic ferrous nanocrystals using bottom-up core/shell interdiffusion process with nanoscale precision. High energy density magnetic nanocomposites will be developed through the self-assembled exchange-coupling (magnetic interaction) of magnetically hard and soft nanocrystals, which will be scaled up by high-throughput microwave processing. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate a bottom-up manufacturing strategy to discover rare-earth-free high-energy density magnetic nanomaterials. \r\n\r\nThis study will represent a versatile nanomanufacturing route for magnetic alloy nanocrystals with unprecedented control of their structures, and create a rational pathway for manipulating bottom-up assembly-controlled exchange-coupling processes. In addition, discovering rare-earth-free high energy density nanomagnets from low cost elements, such as iron and nickel, represent a critical part of present and future sustainable high energy density applications, including smaller, lighter and more efficient motors and generators, as well as non-invasive magnetic hyperthermia biotechnology. A successfully developed ferrous based spring nanomagnets will (1) reduce the U.S. dependence on rare-earth imports; (2) reduce cost and improve efficiency of high energy density applications; and (3) establish U.S. leadership in a wide adoption of green energy technologies. In addition, the benefit to society is that successful results will lead to advances in earth abundant materials and environmentally benign manufacturing applications.",
