The IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is a premier international conference for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in dependability and security of computer systems and networks.\r\n\r\nDSN 2014 will provide many and varied opportunities for student submission and participation. These opportunities range from full-length conference and workshop papers to medium-length preliminary contributions considered by the Student Forum to brief descriptions of early-stage research in the Work in Progress category.  This project is focused primarily on broader impacts through the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of DSN, mentoring that they will receive through the Student Forum activities, and networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference activities.\r\n",

The funds also helped to attract matching funds from IEEE and IFIP, which were used to provide travel grants to 13 international students.  Combining these sources, 28 students were provided an opportunity to attend DSN, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.  Twenty percent of the U.S. students who received awards were female, a group which has traditionally been extremely underrepresented at DSN.  \n\nAfter the conference, SurveyMonkey was used to collect anonymous feedback from the U.S. travel grant awardees concerning their experiences in attending DSN and their satisfaction with the travel grants they received.  Eleven out of the 15 awardees completed the survey.  Some of the highlights of this survey were as follows.  \n\nThe first set of questions was intended to assess the travel grant program itself.  Six of the 11 survey respondents had received travel support to attend one or more other conferences.  Of these, 3 reported the amount of the award was about the same as the others they had received, two reported that the DSN award was more than they had received previously, and one reported that the DSN award was less than their previous award.
