 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern software systems are notoriously large and complex, often made up of hundreds and thousands of interconnected modules, and lines of source code that can number in the millions. Consequently, software developers waste a considerable portion of their time trying to find and get to information in that code. To address this problem, this research project will investigate a scientific theory to describe how developers go about seeking this information. The project will then use the expanded theory to identify ways of helping developers to more efficiently find information, and in the process, increase their productivity. This contribution will in turn be put to practical use by providing to builders of today?s software tools new practical ways to apply this scientific theory to their tools, so as to reduce the effort required in today?s software development projects.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this project will (1) expand Information Foraging Theory to describe how learning affects developers? navigation through code and related artifacts, (2) generate theory-grounded design patterns explaining how to design tools that aid developers?\r\ninformation foraging, (3) develop a design method enabling tool builders to apply these patterns, and (4) evaluate the validity and effectiveness of (1)-(3). Broader impacts will include (a) helping with teaching and learning for software tool builders, professional software developers, graduate students, undergraduates and high schoolers, (b) broadening participation of students from underrepresented groups, (c) producing publicly available infrastructure consisting of design patterns and training materials,\r\n(d) disseminating results via publications, software, and workshops, and (e) providing a scientific foundation for future efforts aimed at training developers and designing tools for their use.",
