 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 11.6 million people were admitted to jail from 2011-2012;\r\nyet, there has been relatively little research examining the impact of short-term incarceration on offender\r\nadjustment. Two opposing theories have typically been provided to explain how inmates adapt to the\r\nincarceration environment. The importation model suggests that inmates bring a host of pre-incarceration\r\nexperiences and characteristics with them into the incarceration environment that account for how\r\ninmates adapt and behave. Conversely, the deprivation model posits the oppressive incarceration\r\nenvironment is responsible for inmate adaptation. Research has found support for both models. \r\nHowever, these theories have not been tested longitudinally in jail. This project will test these theories\r\nthroughout a stay in jail and into the community to update and expand these models. The study will test\r\nthe overarching hypothesis that traumatic experiences with violence encountered before, during, and after\r\njail are related to increased mental health difficulties and recidivism.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred male and female inmates will be recruited to participate in the present study. Subjects will\r\ncomplete surveys approximately once a month for four months, starting from the initial point of\r\nincarceration and ending a month after release from jail. The subjects will self-report psychosocial\r\nproblems including symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, antisocial behavior,\r\naggression, and substance use. Recidivism data will also be collected for released subjects. The\r\nresearchers will use self-report data on violence exposure prior, during, and after incarceration, to explain\r\nthe development of psychopathology and predict mental/behavioral outcomes, as well as identify risk\r\nfactors for recidivism.\r\n\r\nThe current study is the first longitudinal examination to assess developmental changes in mental and\r\nbehavioral health throughout jail and in the community. This project will identify risk and protective\r\nfactors that can be used to create interventions and programs, reducing the risk of recidivism. By learning\r\nmore about the context in which offenders must adapt, researchers can provide informed\r\nrecommendations to policy makers and increase safety in communities and jails.",

It is well known that violence exposure is associated with a host of negative outcomes. Community violence exposure increases aggression, depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior, and post-traumatic stress (PTS; see Buka, Stichick, Birdthistle, &amp; Earls, 2001). However, there has been little research that examines the impact of violence exposure in jail on mental and behavioral health outcomes. The few studies examining this issue have not followed inmates over time; therefore, little is known about the development of these disorders and what may cause them. This project is the first longitudinal study examining developmental changes in mental and behavioral health throughout a stay in jail and into the community.
