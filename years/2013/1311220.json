 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs in the Florida Keys have experienced unprecedented declines over the last 30 years. Hard corals, the backbone of the reef ecosystem, have seen their populations reduced by 44% since 1995. However, the loss of coral is not uniform and it is unclear why some reefs in this system are more resilient to stress than others. For example, reefs closer to shore that are exposed to temperature extremes and pollutants also exhibit higher coral growth and cover than offshore reefs that experience more stable temperatures and better water quality. This project will measure gene activity in corals that were experimentally transplanted between inshore and offshore reef environments. This will help identify the stressors acting at each reef and the mechanisms used by corals to adapt to them. Understanding the physiological mechanisms used by reef-building corals to adapt to local conditions can help refine predictions about how they will respond in time to the effects of global climate change. \r\n\r\nReef-related activities in the Florida Keys generate $3.4 billion in sales and income annually and support 36,000 jobs. Loss of this ecosystem would be devastating both ecologically and economically. The results of this project will advance understanding of the relationship between the environment and the state of the coral reefs. It will also identify mechanisms of coral adaptation, and provide molecular tools to assess coral condition in natural environments which will better inform management practices aimed at conserving this valuable ecosystem. Training of students would occur.",
