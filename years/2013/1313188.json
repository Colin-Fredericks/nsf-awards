The investigators will use these telescopes to construct maps of molecular emission to study how massive star environments affects star and planet formation with a focus on the regions within 50-200 astronomical units (AU) of the host star. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts training two graduate students using the relatively new ALMA observatory, producing an audio-visual fly-through of the Orion star-forming region to share with the public what they learn and working with high school students to produce other multimedia presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStar formation is the fundamental process that determines the cosmic evolution of ordinary matter in our Universe.  Stars are the building blocks of galaxies.   \n\n\nThe gravitational collapse of interstellar clouds produce a wide range of stellar masses.  The abundant low-mass stars shine dimly but live long.  While the Sun will eventually live for about 10 billion years, no star with a mass less than 0.8 times that of the Sun has ever died of natural causes in our 13.8 billion year-old  Universe.  The least massive stars, those having about 1/10-th of the Sun?s mass, are expected to live over 300 billion years, more than 20 times the current age of our Universe.  \n\n\nThe relatively rare massive stars on the other hand, some having 100-times the mass of the Sun, are spendthrifts.   Their brilliant luminosity consumes their nuclear fuel up to a million times faster than our Sun.  Thus, they die, exploding as supernovae, within 3 million years of birth.  \n\n\nSolar systems take 10s of millions of years to form.  Thus dying massive stars can have a profound impacts on forming planets and planetary systems, seeding them with short-lived radio-active species andpowerful blasts of radiative and mechanical energy.  \n\n\nMost stars form in dense groups and clusters containing hundreds of stars in close proximity.  Some of these stars are short-lived, luminous, and massive. \n\n   The Orion constellation contains the nearest region of on-going massive star and star cluster formation.   The main goal of this research is to study this nearby, active star forming complex and its many thousands of your stars in unprecedented detail  using the full array of observational tools now becoming available.  \n\n\nWhile the birth of low-mass stars and their planetary systems is becoming understood, the study of the formation of massive stars is still in its infancy.    In this project, we learned that the most massive star currently forming in Orion, recently underwent a cataclysmic explosion.  \n\n\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array was used to show that about 10 Solar masses of gas was ejected with speeds up to 400 kilometers per second by this explosion behind the Orion Nebula about 550 years ago.  (That is when the light signal from the event would have reached Earth.  Taking the ~1300 light-year distance into account, this event occurred around the year AD 170+/-25 when Marcus Aurelius was emperor of Rome.)  This explosion released about 10^48 ergs of energy - more energy than the Sun puts out in 10 million years!\n\n\nThe explosion was likely triggered by the interaction of three or four stars in the dense star-forming gas located a few tenths of a light year behind the Orion Nebula.  Two stars collided and merged; the merger remnant plus two other stars were ejected.  The merger remnant, the 15 Solar mass star known as radio source I (Src I), along with two other stars were ejected with speeds of 13 to 55 kilometers per second about 550 years ago.   A figure is enclosed showing the expanding debris traced by carbon monoxide (red and cyan), the shock waves created by this ejecta as it slams into surrounding gas (orange),  and the motions of the ejected stars (yellow arrows whose lengths correspond to the motions of these stars over the next 2,000 years).  \n\n\nThese observations show that dynamic interactions in dense clusters can eject stars from their birth environments.  Such interactions, combined with the feedback of energy and momentum into the star-forming cloud may limit the fraction of a cloud?s mass that can be converted into stars, and the random timing of when a star is ejected by the gravitational \"slingshot\" mechanism when stars interact may determine a star?s final mass. \n\n\nThis project also supported the acquisition and analysis of the most detailed map of carbon monoxide (CO) emission from an entire star forming cloud ever produced.   CO is the most abundant easy to observe molecule in interstellar space. It is used to map the mass, energy, momentum, and motions (via the Doppler effect) of star-forming gas.  The map, produced by the CARMA interferometer in California, covers over two square degrees of the Orion A molecular cloud which has spawned the Orion Nebula, and the dense cloud core in which a protostellar merger occurred in AD 170.\n\n\nCombined with other data sets, this map shows how hundreds of lower-mass stars forming from the gravitational collapse of portions of this cloud are powering spectacular jets and outflows.  These observations show that energy and momentum released by the forming stars can limit the fraction of a clouds?s mass that can be converted to stars to something line 5 to 15% of the cloud?s mass.  Thus, star birth is a self-limiting process.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Bally"
