 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThis proposal requests support for research on Early Jurassic vertebrate fauna of the Beardmore Glacier region of Antarctica. The project will support preparation and systematic and paleobiological research on four Antarctic dinosaurs, including two new species, collected in the Central Transantarctic Mountains. With the new material Cryolophosaurus will become one of the most complete Early Jurassic theropods known, and thus has the potential to become a keystone taxon for resolving the debated early evolutionary history of theropod dinosaurs, the group that gave rise to birds. Two new dinosaur specimens include a nearly complete articulated skeleton of a juvenile sauropodomorph, and the articulated hip region of another small individual. Both appear to be new taxa. The dinosaurs from the Hanson Formation represent some of the highest paleolatitude vertebrates known from the Jurassic. The PIs will generate CT datasets for Cryolophosaurus and the more complete new sauropodomorph species to mine for phylogenetic trait information, and to investigate their comparative neuroanatomy and feeding behavior. Histological datasets will be generated from multiple skeletal elements for all four Mt. Kirkpatrick taxa to understand patterns of growth in different clades of polar dinosaurs and compare them to relatives from lower paleolatitudes. This paleohistological study of a relatively diverse sample of sauropodomorph taxa from Antarctica may contribute to determining whether and how these dinosaurs responded to contemporary climatic extremes.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe PIs have established a successful undergraduate training program as part of previous research. Summer interns from Augustana are trained at the Field Museum in specimen preparation, curation, molding/casting, and histological sampling. They also participate in existing Field Museum REU programs, including a course on phylogenetic systematics. Four undergraduate internships and student research projects will be supported through this proposal. The PIs will develop a traveling exhibit on Antarctic Mesozoic paleontology that they estimate will be seen by 2.5 million people over the five-year tour.",

Over three tons of bone-bearing rock were collected during a previous, highly successful 2010-11 field season. New material prepared and identified includes the partial skeletons of two new species of long-necked sauropodomorph dinosaur, plus additional material from the previously described Antarctic dinosaurs: the meat-eating theropod <em>Cryolophosaurus ellioti</em> and the long-necked sauropodomorph <em>Glacialisaurus hammeri</em>. A previously collected specimen from the site has also been recognized as a new species of pterosaur, which fills a critical diversity and temporal gap in our understanding of pterosaur evolution. Preparation and research on the new specimens at the Field Museum, Augustana College, and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County was supported, as well as molding and casting of specimens for scientific exchange and a new traveling exhibit under development. Computed Tomography (CT) datasets were collected on specimens to provide information about the morphology and neuroanatomy of select species. Quantitave datasets of anatomical traits were constructed for several dinosaur groups in order to analyze the evolutionary relationships of the Antarctic species and understand patterns of biodiversity, biogeography, and ecology in dinosaurs during the early Mesozoic. Histological datasets have been constructed for several species in order to investigate patterns of growth and physiology in high-paleolatitude dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>Key outcomes of this project include: 1) The discovery and recognition of at least one, and possibly two, new species of long-necked sauropodomorph dinosaur (one of which is represented by a nearly complete skeleton); 2) Establishment and refinement of the evolutionary relationships of the Hanson Formation dinosaurs; 3) Recognition of a new species of pterosaur; 4) Ongoing support and training of museum preparators/technicians, undergraduate/graduate students, and a Postdoctoral Research Scientist; 5) Physical and web-based museum educational programming related to Antarctic paleontology; and 6) Development of a \"Antarctic Dinosaurs\" traveling museum exhibit, slated for opening June 2018, and predicted to reach over 2 million visitors during a planned five-year run.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246379/1246379_10222690_1490817015152_MapofMt.Kirkpatrick,AntarcticDinosaurlocality--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1246379/1246379_10222690_1490817015152_MapofMt.Kirkpatrick,AntarcticDinosaurlocality--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mt.
