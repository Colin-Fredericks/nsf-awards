 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI), Professors Martin Fischer, Warren Warren, Robert Opila, Dr.  Jennifer Mass and their groups will develop a novel imaging method for nondestructive identification and high-resolution, three-dimensional mapping of both tissue and a broad range of pigment samples in historic works of art.  The primary focus of the proposed research will be to set up a multimodal nonlinear optical microscope for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging and use pulse shaping and time-resolved detection technology for simultaneous access to absorptive and refractive contrasts and further develop novel analysis and characterization methods for tissue samples and pigments. The groups will then set up three-dimensional (3D) imaging of thick tissue, paint cross-sections and intact historic paintings and further increase imaging depth for molecular absorption and nonlinear phase contrast. The researchers will develop a portable microscope for applications in the field and the core technology developed will then be disseminated through industrial partners.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research, if successful, will enable in situ applications in a conservation setting to avoid having to remove artworks from their climate-controlled environment, which will dramatically impact conservation science by providing a non-invasive imaging modality that can extract comprehensive structural and chemical information from historic artwork, complementing established mapping techniques.  The technology developed will also provide tools to the broad biology community to examine structural, metabolic and functional contrast in biological tissue. The program will provide training opportunities in an interdisciplinary environment spanning conservation science, art history, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering for graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.",
