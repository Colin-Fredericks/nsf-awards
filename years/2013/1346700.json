This is the fourth conference in a series of international conferences held on this topic, the last three being held in Taiwan, China and Atlanta. The conference provides an excellent venue for  interaction with researchers from academic and research institutions, as well as from industry, around the world.\r\n\r\nA wide range of topics will be covered, ranging from microfluidics, nanofluids and manufacturing to diagnostics and applications. Research presented will include both fundamental issues at these small scales, and their applications in heat transfer enhancement, biomedical systems, electronic devices, materials processing, drug delivery, and diagnostics. It is important to bring researchers in these diverse fields together to exchange ideas for future growth and application in this and related areas.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is requesting travel support to partially defray the travel of researchers from USA to attend this conference. Students, post-doctoral fellows, minorities and women,  in the broad area of micro/nanoscale transport, will have priority. Invited speakers will also be covered through modest financial support.",
