 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from Southern Illinois University (SIU) and Saint Louis University (SLU) are deploying 45 broadband seismographs and three short-period seismic arrays in the Wabash Valley in Illinois and Indiana. The experiment is part of the on-going EarthScope project and is aimed at better understanding the driving forces of the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone (WVSZ) such as regional lithospheric stresses exploiting a weak zone, glacial isostatic adjustment, and lithospheric basal tractions induced by mantle dynamics.  By applying a variety of seismic techniques including body wave and surface wave tomography, receiver functions, shear-wave splitting, and mapping of background crustal seismicity, this seismic experiment will illuminate the seismic structure beneath the study area and impose valuable constraints on driving mechanism for this geologically enigmatic feature as well as further our understanding of intraplate earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis project directly advances the Earthscope mission to advance our understanding of intraplate seismic zone dynamics and to improve seismic hazard assessments in the midcontinent. It allows for more quantitative comparisons between the WVSZ and the New Madrid Seismic Zone to its south. It furthers the education of a PhD student at SIU and one at SLU as well as sponsors undergraduate research at both institutions. The students are involved in a number of different aspects of the research from the fieldwork comprising station installation, servicing, and data collection to data analysis and interpretation. These students learn a number of seismic analytical methods that point them towards further research and study within the framework of EarthScope and other cutting-edge scientific initiatives. The PIs of the project work with science teachers at several high schools located in the study area. Two seismographs are located on school property, with display for students to view real-time seismic data and provide access to educational resources from Earthscope.",

We produced a high-resolution crustal structure image across the seismic zone from joint inversion results of surface wave dispersions and receiver functions. Several features of crustal structure are revealed. There is a very low velocity layer that reaches up to 5 km at the center of the rift zone. A sharp middle crustal velocity discontinuity at depth from 14 km in the SE side (Kentucky) to 20 km in the NW side (Illinois basin). A lens-shaped high velocity zone exists in the upper crust. It is lopsided to the NW end of the profile, with the maximum thickness of 8 km. The Moho is sharp, continuous, and relatively flat at depths from 50 km in the SE of the profile to the 56 km in the NW. It warps upwards beneath the center of rift. There is a layer of high velocity at the bottom of the lower crust. Its thickness varies from a few kms in the SE to 15 km in NW. Our crustal image confirmed some general aspects of the failed-rift model proposed by Braile (1986) but also show some new interesting features. The deepest part of sedimentary layer is located at the center of the rift. The middle crustal interface skirts the buried rift structure below the sedimentary layers where rift faults are probably present. The high velocity anomaly, likely dense materials, in the upper crust is probably a stack of basaltic volcanics erupted during the main stage of the rifting. The rift structure seems a little asymmetric around its axis, making the interface more steep in the NW side and more gentle in the SE. Thickness variation of the high velocity layer in the lower crust correlates with variation of the Complete Bouguer Anomaly at the surface. Therefore, the high velocity layer represent dense mafic materials at the base of the lower crust that underplated during the rifting. Because of high density, they tend to pond near the Moho and to cause melting in the lower crust to give rise to a secondary volcanism. In such a scenario, the partial melt is always less dense than the parent rock, but the residue (the refractory remnants) will be denser. This is likely to be the case for having a local weak zone in the middle crust as a result of post-rift magmatism. Previous studies found a low velocity zone (LVZ) in the upper-mantle beneath the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone.
