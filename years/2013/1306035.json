 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objectives of this program are to investigate fiber lasers that support new pulse evolutions in their cavities, and to use the knowledge gained to demonstrate practical instruments with unprecedented performance.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in understanding of new nonlinear waves. The field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers based on formation of solitons, pulses that balance phase shifts with anomalous group-velocity dispersion. In the last few years, pulse-shaping based on nonlinear gain and loss, in normal-dispersion media, has been introduced. This approach is transformative as it counters two decades of conventional wisdom regarding the generation of light pulses. Lasers with self-similar propagation of light pulses in their gain media exhibit new phenomena, such as the existence of local nonlinear attraction in a laser. The self-similar evolution opens new routes to lasers with very low noise and to lasers that generate pulses that contain only a few cycles of light.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts are the demonstration of useful (and eventually commercial) instruments with new capabilities for energetic, ultra-short light pulses. These instruments will expand the field of ultra-fast science and will bring short-pulse capabilities to new arenas such as medical clinics. Students will gain experience ranging from theory and numerical simulations to technical aspects of fiber optics and knowledge of applications of ultra-short light pulses. The research on fiber lasers will be coupled to undergraduate and graduate laboratories. Participation in activities sponsored by 4-H will expose rural students to science and technology.",

These range from experiments that allow monitoring of chemical reactions as they occur, to new techniques for microscopes that can see deeper into brain tissue, for example.  Such lasers would be very useful for application beyond scientific research, such as machining and surgery, if they could be made from optical fiber.  The challenge is generating high-power short pulses in a fiber laser; pulses tend to get distorted in the fiber.  This project investigated ways to allow high-power pulses to propagate through fiber without distortion.\n\nSignificant advances were made in understanding the fundamental limits of ultrashort light pulses, development of lasers that produce ultrashort pulses at infrared wavelengths, and determination of the fundamental limits to high-power lasers. Several lasers that offer new capabilities, or major performance increases over existing capabilities, were demonstrated in the course of this work. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \n\n       Educational/Outreach Activities\n\n \n\nIn the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016 we ran workshops for junior-high-school students as part of the \"University U\" program of the New York State 4-H.
