 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Evan Williams at University of California, Berkeley, and his group will be developing thermochemical tools that will enable novel measurements that can lead to both detailed insights into ion-water interactions as well as an accurate new way to measure energetics of challenging chemical reactions.  Ions play important roles in chemistry and biology, and can affect a wide range of physical properties, including structures of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA.  Although much is known about ion chemistry, the origins of some ion-induced effects are still hotly debated.  The accuracy of a method developed by this group called nanocalorimetry will be calibrated using laser-generated light at precise frequencies.  This method will then be applied to understanding how water solvates ions and to measure energetics of chemical reactions.  These state-of-the-art measurements should make it possible to obtain information about the electrochemical properties of ions that have not been measured using conventional methods, such as one-electron reduction potentials of some ions.  From measurements of absolute reduction potentials of single ions in aqueous nanodrops, an accurate absolute electrochemical scale and absolute ion solvation scale could be established.  Because the sizes of the nanodrops are so small, a significant fraction of the water molecules in these droplets are at the surface.  Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy will be used to investigate how ions affect the hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules, both in the interior of the nanodrop as well as at the surface.  Ions at surfaces have been extensively investigated with computation chemistry, but the water surface can be difficult to characterize with conventional spectroscopic methods owing to the overwhelming number of water molecules below the surface of bulk samples.  \r\n\r\nThis research bridges many traditional disciplines in science, and data obtained in these studies provide stringent benchmarks that can be used by others to improve the accuracy of computational methods, which are being increasingly applied to solving important problem in chemistry.  Both graduate and undergraduate students who participate in this research, as well as those who enroll in a related undergraduate course on chemical instrumentation or a dedicated graduate course on mass spectrometry learn about the newest developments in mass spectrometry, a method that is used in many fields of science with applications ranging from drug discovery, molecular characterization of cellular contents, chemical imaging, and petroleum characterization.  Prior NSF funded research has lead to international collaborations, which exposes students to different cultures and approaches to science, and this NSF funded project will enable continued opportunities to do so.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIons and water in confined spaces play important roles in the chemistry that occurs in nature, including atmospheric aerosols and cellular biology.  Some ions stabilize the native folded structures of proteins whereas other ions can cause proteins to unfold into inactive forms.  By using mass spectrometry combined with infrared spectroscopy, new information about how water interacts with ions, how water can change the structures of ions, and how ions can affect the hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules located remotely from the ion have been gained.  In these studies, ions are mass selected and the structures are probed using light from an infrared laser that yields information about characteristic vibrations in a molecular ion.  These experiments provide exquisite details about molecular structure and the interactions of ions with water and with biomolecules.  Water can form structures around ions known as clathrates.  Clathrates are common in nature and have been implicated in global climate change and blocking of oil pipelines.  Clathrates also have potential practical implications, such as sequestration of greenhouse gases and they are a significant reservoir of natural gas.  Results from these studies show that water clathrates can form around common ions and some ions can incorporate into the surface of clathrates.  Ion-water interactions also play an important role in the structures of proteins.  The folded form of a protein is usually critical for its function and it has been known for well over 125 years that different ions can either stabilize or destabilize these folded forms.  The origin of this effect has been hotly debated and there is no clear consensus about how this occurs.  Our results on ion-water interactions provide new insights into how guanidinium, an ion that is used in thousands of laboratories worldwide, can interact with and aid in unfolding protein ions.  Another key outcome of this research is a detailed understanding about how ions can disrupt the crystalline form of ice.  Salts are widely used to melt ice on roads, yet the contributions of individual ions on the physical properties of water is difficult to ascertain in conventional experiments owing the ubiquitous presence of counter ions.  Our experiments isolate the effects of individual ions and show how a trivalent cation (3+) charged ion can affect the orientation of water molecules, even those located remotely from the ion, and can prevent the formation of crystalline ice.  Similar experiments with trivalent anions (3-) also show how these ions orient water molecules at long distance and the essential role that water plays in stabilizing these ions that do not exist without water.  Ions are ubiquitous in nature and these studies have lead to new insights into the chemistry of these important species.\n\nStudents working on these projects learn practical skills including analytical problem solving.  They learn how to operate, trouble shoot, and repair complex instruments and learn how to design and build new instrumentation.  Many students also learn computer programming and computational approaches to interpreting complex data sets.  Students also learn how to present their work to broad audiences, teach others, and gain experience working in a team to solve difficult analytical challenges.  Knowledge gained from this research is taught in a course on mass spectrometry that is taken by both undergraduate and graduate students from many different disciplines.  Students in this course learn how to tackle challenging problems through hands on spectral interpretation, skills that are valuable for solving other difficult problems that they encounter in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan R Williams"
