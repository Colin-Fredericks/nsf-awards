 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative proposal will connect the researchers from Stanford with their colleagues in the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health and Aalto University, Finland to identify the stresses and cognitive demands that are placed on learners who are participating in multi-cultural and cross-disciplinary collaborations in a rich technology-enabled learning environment. The research will be situated in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction Global Teamwork course in the Problem Based Learning Laboratory at Stanford University that engages students in teamwork with partners worldwide. Multiple sources of data will be collected that examine a number of dimensions of student learning experiences including the number of disciplines embodied by the team structure, the number of cultures that influence the communication within the teams, the impact of space and time interactions and the multiple channels by which communication takes place among team members. Physiological data will be collected to identify indicators of stress, and ways that learners and instructions can monitor and self-regulate their well-being and engagement will be identified.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly global economy, the conditions under which teams will be required to work and learn together are increasingly diverse and require that virtual learning environments become more collaborative. This research has the potential to inform those who design virtual learning environments that engage individuals and teams from different cultural milieus whose interactions are separated by time and space. Ways to mitigate the stresses that occur across these separations that foster better communications across cultural differences will contribute to design elements for learning experiences in not only post-secondary courses, but also interactions in the global workspace.",

With globalization and the advances in information and communication technologies (ICT),  global teamwork across geographical and cultural boundaries has become a common practice in both education and industry. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education in a global setting exposes learners to five dimensions of discontinuities - time, space, culture, discipline, and technology.  Although they may first seem unrelated to learning, the five discontinuities put new cognitive demands on learners in terms of participation, engagement, and knowledge creation. Cognition depends on learning environments, e.g., choice of interaction space and ICT, and the psychophysiological state of learners. The UNCODE exploratory study aimed to uncover the hidden cognitive demands of global learning environments on STEM learners.  This study involved a total of 120 students from the academic years of 2013, 2014, and 2015. The students participated in an innovative 16 week project-based learning \"Architecture, Engineering, Construction Global Teamwork\" course organized by the Project-Based Learning (PBL) Lab at Stanford with partners worldwide. The research results provide valuable insights and benefits to both the learners and the instructors towards monitoring and self-regulating their cognitive load, well-being, and engagement during global collaboration activities. This study offers fundamental contributions to global education and has shown potentially transformative interactive learning experiences for online STEM education.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit. UNCODE offers methodological and scientific breakthrough outcomes that provide a fresh lens through which researchers and educators can examine distributed learning for STEM education programs. The research has developed innovative learning analytics and indicators to determine cognitive load and degrees of engagement in a geographically distributed learning context.   Furthermore, the study has formalized and implemented a data collection protocol focused on STEM students\u00c6 weekly online global project team meetings.  The innovative multi-method research approach combines quantitative physiological sensor measurements, qualitative field study methods, and survey methods.  The project has demonstrated the use of mobile and unobtrusive sensor technologies in a real-life learning environment to aid learning and well-being in a global 24/7 setting. Sensors yield big data and the analytic tools and the learning indicators developed in this research provide moment-by-moment insights into learners\u00c6 state. The investigation has led to greater understanding and improvements of collaborative distance-learning. The key findings include:\n\nHidden cognitive demands of geographically distributed, multi-cultural, and cross-disciplinary collaboration in rich multi-media environments and their impact on students\u00c6 learning experience, engagement, and well-being. The research has identified an \"Afterglow\" phenomenon, which shows that high engagement of learners decreases fatigue effect in a global teamwork environment.\nWarning signs, such as stress, that are identified from physiological data during or prior to an non-optimal learning/work state;\nWays that learners and instructors can monitor and self-regulate their cognitive load, well-being, and engagement during global collaboration based on such warning sign indicators.\nClassification of collaboration platforms to characterize the engagement potential and engagement capacity to assist learners and instructors to select the technologies that best support the learning and collaboration activities.\n\n\nBroader Impacts. The methodologies, experimental field observations and results of this research can help enhance the productivity of learners and knowledge workers. On the UNCODE project, the research team involved three PhD students and one MSc student.  Two of the three PhD students are women and the MSc student is an African-American.  Additi..."
