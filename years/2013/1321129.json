 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the study of cooperation in distributed networks, first through the study of simple structures that isolate dedicated resources for global or local cooperation and then directly in general networks.  The work is organized into three thrusts.  The first thrust employs a global facilitator that has access to all messages in the network and can transmit a rate-R description of these messages to all nodes. Bounding the capacity of such a network as a function of R gives a first-order estimate of the minimal cost and maximal benefit of cooperation in a given network.  In the second thrust, we move from global to local models of cooperation to understand how much of the cooperative advantage can be achieved using smaller groups of cooperators.  The final thrust studies the implementation and approximation of the most successful cooperation strategies from the earlier thrusts for use in wireless, sensor, and wired networks; here the rate employed to enable cooperation shares the same network resources as the capacity it aims to increase.\r\n\r\nExample networks demonstrate large potential benefits in communication system performance through the use of strategies that employ cooperation among the communicating devices.  Performance improvement is here measured as an increase in the amount of information that can be reliably delivered through a communication network.  Increasing rate through cooperation may allow more users to simultaneous communicate or each user to communicate at an increased rate in a given network. This project aims to develop the theoretical foundations of cooperation-based communication strategies and to help guide the design of communication protocols that realize the benefits of cooperation in practice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWireless communication networks play an increasingly prevalent role in our world.  They connect individuals with friends and family, businesses with customers and suppliers, and both with information and services any time and any where.\n\nOver time, the growth of our communication networks has fueld the growth of our economy.  Since wireless networks rely on fundamental resources that do not themselves grow, increasing wireless capabilities requires making better use of the resources already available. Coopertion is one strategy for accomplishing that goal.  \n\nIn wireless networks, cooperation refers to communication between devices not for the purpose of sending messages between them but instead for the purpose of increasing the amount of information that can be sent to some third party in the network.  For example, two cell phones in the same vicinity might exchange information not for the purpose of communicating with each other but instead for the purpose of getting better data rates and call quality from the same base sttion or WiFi hub.  \n\nIn this work, we explore cooperation with the goal of understanding when the benefits of cooperation exceed their cost.  We measure cost by the data rates exchanged between the cooperating devices and benefit by the increased network capacity achieved through that exchange.  We wish to understand when and where in the network it is useful to employ cooperation by studying when and by how much the benefits of cooperation can exceed its costs.  \n\nThe results of this work include a variety of important advances from the perspective of both intellectual merit and broader impact.  \n\nKey findings from the perspective of intellectual merit include:\n\nIntroduction of a new \"cooperation facilitator\" model for cooperation.  In previous models, the benefit of cooperation never exceeds its cost;  the cooperation facilitator model makes this possible.\nDemonstration of the existence of networks in which the benefit of cooperation through a cooperation facilitator grows very quickly (almost exponentially) as a function of the cost.  \nProof that for any network where the exchange of a lot of information between the cooperating devices would improve performance, exchanging a little bit of information through a cooperation facilitator gives a much bigger performance benefit -- as demonstrated by an infinite slope in the cost-benefit curve.\nProof that there exist networks where even a cost that is so small as to be negligible in the long term can have a non-trivial benefit in network performance.  \nProof that there exist networks where even a single bit used for the purpose of cooperation can have a non-trivial benefit in network performance.  \nDemonstration that cooperation is typically more beneficial in data transmission than in data reception.  \n\n\nKey results from the perspective of broader impact include training of students directly involved in the research, broad dissemination of research results, and involvement in activities focused on encouraging broader participation of under-represented groups in science and technology.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Effros"
