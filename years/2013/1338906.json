The Center proposes to overcome challenges facing the wheat industry partners, and that will strategically and efficiently derive value from the wealth of genetic diversity in the Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC). \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will focus on developing new methods for using wheat genetic diversity, both natural and induced, to solve problems for farmers and end users of wheat. Industry members will provide market awareness, ensuring delivery of traits important to end-users. WGRC's goal will be to significantly reduce the market-ready time by providing novel traits in elite genotypes. WGRC will develop and apply innovative methods to incorporate novel, high-value traits in wheat breeding programs for sustainable and profitable crop production. WGRC houses one of the worlds premier collections of wheat germplasm and genetic tools, routinely capitalized in applied breeding programs worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe project will have significant broader impacts in a number of areas. Wheat is a critical source of protein, and world health depends upon production which has been impacted by climate change. A doctoral program in seed and wheat breeding will be an element of the program and is clearly needed. Over the last few years, the researchers involved in the center have had significant impact through providing industrially relevant education to a large number of students, including many from underrepresented groups.",

Wheat is a genetically complex crop that is composed of three genomes, designated A, B, and D, each originating from a wild species native to the Middle East or Central Asia. Due to its evolutionary history, the D-genome is the least diverse constituent of bread wheat, and therefore, incorporation of additional diversity from that genome may benefit wheat breeding efforts.</p>\n<p>The long-term goal for the Colorado State University component of this project was to improve drought tolerance in bread wheat by incorporating novel D-genome diversity from the wild species <em>Aegilops tauschii</em> into adapted cultivars. Specific objectives were</p>\n<p>1) to evaluate variation within the mini-core collection of 42 <em>Ae. tauschii</em> accessions that originated across a broad geography from Syria to Kyrgyzstan, with the aim of identifying lines with useful productivity or drought tolerance traits;</p>\n<p>2) to identify high yielding, well adapted progeny of crosses between Great Plains cultivars and lines containing <em>Ae. tauschii</em> germplasm;</p>\n<p>3) to determine the microbiome (bacterial and fungal communities) associated with leaves, roots, and adjacent soil (rhizosphere) of wheat and eight wild relative species.</p>\n<p>Greenhouse and field evaluations were conducted over a 5-year period (2014-2018). The evaluated materials included accessions of wild species, primarily <em>Ae. tauschii</em>, from the Wheat Genetics Resource Center in Manhattan, KS, as well as progeny derived from crosses of the wild species with adapted wheat cultivars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Objective 1. Root trait evaluations conducted in 1-meter x 10-centimeter plastic tubes in the greenhouse indicated significant variation among accessions for root length, diameter, biomass, and response to drought treatments. In field evaluations of the <em>Ae. tauschii</em> mini-core, the accessions differed markedly for maturity dates, above-ground biomass, stem and seed number, and performance in well-watered versus drought stress treatments. Based on the greenhouse and field evaluations, we were able to identify several accessions that show promise for crossing with adapted cultivars.</p>\n<p>Objective 2. Evaluation of progeny that incorporated <em>Ae. tauschii</em> germplasm in an adapted cultivar genetic background involved several sets of materials: (1) crosses of the Colorado cultivar Hatcher with five synthetic hexaploid lines; (2) crosses of seven <em>Ae. tauschii</em> accessions with the Kansas advanced breeding line KS05HW14; and (3) crosses of synthetic hexaploid lines with the Texas cultivars TAM 111 and TAM 112. In total, we evaluated 536 materials, which contained on average 12 to 25% exotic germplasm. The evaluated traits varied with the environmental conditions, but included grain yield, maturity dates, kernel weight, above-ground biomass, canopy spectral reflectance, stripe rust resistance, and winter hardiness. Our results indicated that several of the progeny lines had appropriate maturities and yielded as well as the adapted cultivars, but many were inferior for various characteristics, including low grain yield, susceptibility to stripe rust and sensitivity to cold winter temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Objective 3. Our microbiome investigation based on DNA analysis revealed distinct communities of bacteria and fungi in leaves, roots, and rhizosphere. The rhizosphere microbes were the most diverse and the leaf microbes the least diverse. There were also differences in microbes between the wet and dry field treatments. However, there were only minor differences in microbial communities among plant species. Therefore, despite the advancement and evolution of modern wheat, the microbiome remains essentially the same as the microbiomes of its wild relatives, when grown in the same soil. This indicates that modern winter wheat retains the same ability to recruit and sustain its associated microbes as its wild relatives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This project provided training opportunities for
