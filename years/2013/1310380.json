 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Janice E. Reutt-Robey of the University of Maryland, College Park, and her students will use a combination of scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy measurements to  image functionalized carbon-based C70 nanoparticles and nanoassemblies at crystalline surfaces. This research will determine how functional groups influence the transport, stability  and structural arrangements of nanoparticles at interfaces.   Prof. Reutt-Robey and her students will undertake systematic measurements of two nanomaterial classes:  (1) covalently functionalized nanoparticles and (2) nanomolecular assemblies joined by weak (noncovalent)  forces.   They will develop vacuum-compatible liquid delivery methods, based upon microaerosols and microliquid jets, for the controlled deposition of nanomaterials at well-defined surfaces.   They will obtain detailed topographic and potentiometric contours of discrete species by UHV Scanning Probe Microscopy through complementary tunneling-based and force-based measurements.  The impact of nanoparticle electric moment, polarizability, and stereo features on structure and dynamic evolution will be determined for pristine nanoparticles and for solvated nanoparticles and nanoassemblies.   Molecular-level mechanisms for nanoparticle motion, disassembly and nanocrystallizaiton under different thermochemical stimuli will be measured. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide laboratory research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and junior scientists with direct exposure to  cutting-edge experimental methods and instrumentation.  Students and researchers will gain expertise in nanoparticle characterization, thin film growth and the preparation of advanced materials.  Additionally, students will become trained in quantitative scanned probe measurements and analysis and will receive hands-on training and experience in surface-sensitive microscopies and spectroscopies and vacuum science.  The project consists of a systematic exploration of nanoparticle structure and dynamics at chemical interfaces, which will provide detailed information on how nanoparticles diffuse at surfaces and arrange into functional structures.  The external field tunability of nanoparticle orientation during growth and trapped in multilayer films will be quantified through structural and impedance spectroscopic measurements.   Students and researchers will have significant opportunities to participate in educational and outreach activities with broad national, international and societal impact.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nCarbon-based nanoparticles have emerged as among the most useful components in organic nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, and as biomedical probe and theranostic agents.  Although fullerenes offer electronic and charge-transport features essential for organic electronic applications, all-carbon materials present significant processing and nanomanufacturing challenges.  Chemical derivatives of fullerenes that are stable, homogeneous and solution processable can overcome these processing challenges, widening the scope of carbon nanomaterial applications and improving their environmental remediation.    Importantly, the addition of chemical groups and chemical modifications to improve such processing, significantly alters the packing arrangements of carbon-nanoparticles, and the interactions and transport of carbon nanomaterials across host materials.  The intellectual merit of this project centered on gaining a fundamental and more predictive understanding on how anisotropic interactions of fullerene derivatives direct packing arrangements and migration of fullerene derivatives in organic thin films and at metallic surfaces.\n\nThis project revealed how the electrostatic features of a carbon nanoparticle impact the structures and thermally induced arrangements of nanoparticles deposited from solution.   The electrostatic features of a carbon nanoparticle, derived from chemical functionalization, were quantitated by quantum chemistry calculations.  Using a microaerosol solution-deposition method developed under this support, ultrathin films of carbon-nanoparticles with glassy structures and substantial (few percent) solvent retention were  first created.    Anisotropic nanoparticle-nanoparticle interactions and reorientational barriers account for such  metastable films structures.  Scanning Tunneling Microscopy methods were used to track the thermally induced nanoparticle ordering into dense nanocrystalline arrangements and release of trapped solvent molecules.    For  multicomponent films(functionalized carbon nanoparticle + carbon macrocycle), we showed how electrostatic interactions between carbon-nanoparticles and a solid support (dielectric or metallic) drive interfacial mobility and generate energetically preferred  nanomaterial architectures, including layered structures, nanophase-separated structures,  and nanoparticle chain-necklace like structures.  Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Dielectric Spectroscopy as complementary probes, we monitored the dynamics of carbon-nanomolecular arrangement from the single-carbon nanoparticle regime (by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) to the collective-response regime (Dielectric Spectroscopy).   Using fullerenols as a model system, we further showed how functionalized fullerenes exhibit a negligible response under the driving condition of a frequency-modulated electromagnetic field over a broad frequency range, whereas solvent water molecules confined to interstitial sites within a nanoparticle film respond readily to the driving field.  Functionalized carbon nanomaterials at metallic and organic interfaces undergo reorientation under direct electric fields of the order 109V/m, given sufficient free volume to support reorientation.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project provided cutting-edge laboratory research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and junior scientists with advanced training in the preparation  of carbon-nanomaterials and their interfaces, and their analytis by   surface microscopy (esp. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Kelvin Force Microscopy), spectroscopy (especially Dielectric Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Desorption Spectroscopy).   In addition, students gained experience in the design and development of scientific apparatus, including apparatus  for pulsed molecular beam microaerosol deposition, scan probe microscopy, sample transfer and manipulaiton, and temperature programmed desorption.  The research methodologies developed under this grant are applicable to the research community, and serve as another impact fo this grant.\n\nThe fundamental understanding of the static and dynamical structures of functionalized carbon nanomaterials, particularly as they relate to their electrostatic features, provides a rational framework for controlling the structure and stability of carbon nanomaterial systems, benefitting technological applications of these materials.\n\nAdditionally, the PI and her students participated in a number of K-12 outreach activities, such as the University of Maryland Chemathon and the Maryland Science Olympiad, increasing the pipeline for STEM.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janice E Reutt-Robey"
