 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the rates, durations, and interplay between geologic processes relies on accurate dating of minerals. Under favorable circumstances, it is possible to confirm the accuracy of these dates by applying different dating techniques to the same, or related, minerals. An increasingly important benchmark in mineral dating as well as a valuable source of insights into the evolution of voluminous explosive eruptions is the >600 km3 Bishop Tuff of eastern California, USA. This project will test the hypothesis that U-Pb and Ar/Ar dates for the minerals zircon and sanidine, respectively, are essentially identical in the Bishop Tuff. It will determine whether there are U-Pb age heterogeneities within Bishop Tuff zircon and, if present, to more rigorously quantify them. If the age distribution with zircon is homogeneous, this study will validate use of the Bishop Tuff as a key intercalibration point between the U-Pb and Ar/Ar radiometric clocks. If older zircon domains are present, their ages and their population distributions will validate previous evidence that dates for zircon cores can be considerably older than the sanidine dates. Rapid confirmation or rejection, as enabled by EAGER funding, of the hypothesis that the U-Pb and Ar/Ar dates are identical will have an immediate impact on efforts to improve the accuracy of Ar/Ar dating, a technique capable of providing precise dates for events in the Cenozoic Era, and for geologic materials that may be difficult to date by other methods. The outcome will inform models for how magmas responsible for supervolcanoes accumulate beneath Earth?s surface.\r\n\r\nThe project will explore novel approaches to acquiring spatially sensitive and analytically more robust ion microprobe dates for Bishop Tuff zircons. Analyses will be performed on zircon rims and on oriented cross-sections exposed during optical interferometry-calibrated serial sectioning, resulting in a high spatial sensitivity with respect to crystal growth. Grains will be mounted sequentially so that rim and interior analyses can be performed in tandem, reducing the reliance on a standard for confirming age differences within grains, if present. Sputtering will entail a 100 nA ion beam instead of the normally employed 10-12 nA beam, resulting in enhanced radiogenic Pb yields and reduced analytical uncertainties. Once the age distribution within the BT zircons has been quantified, mass balance analyses will be performed in order to assess whether the zircons crystallized in a few ka and, if older zircon domains are present, the extent to which they could skew the ages obtained by single crystal TIMS analyses. The new technical approaches to be explored in this study could advance the precision of situ U-Pb dating and be adopted by other in situ geochronologists seeking to gain more insight into age heterogeneities and their distributions within crystals for timescales of magma chamber processes. The proposed study will also provide research training in spatially sensitive U-Pb zircon dating for a female graduate student.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe &gt;600 km3 Bishop Tuff of eastern California is an important benchmark for methods of geologic dating as well as a valuable source of insights into the evolution of voluminous explosive eruptions. The Bishop Tuff is thought to have erupted around 770 ka (thousand years) ago, as dated by the argon-argon (Ar/Ar) method. One study concluded that a distinctively U-rich mineral, zircon, mainly crystallized close to when the Bishop Tuff erupted, and uranium-lead (U-Pb) dates for this mineral could therefore be used to improve the accuracy of Ar/Ar dating. This is significant because Ar/Ar dating is capable of providing precise dates for events in Earth\u00c6s relatively recent past and for geologic materials that may be difficult to date by other methods. At seeming odds with the proposal of near-eruption zircon crystallization are other studies that found Bishop Tuff zircon crystallization ages tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of ka older than eruption. To confirm or refute these older ages, we employed a new approach aimed at quantifying age differences within and between zircon grains exposed to different depths internally.\n\nU-Pb dates for the rims of Bishop Tuff zircon average 766&plusmn;7 ka, in excellent agreement with a reported Ar/Ar eruption age of 767.4&plusmn;2.2 ka, and corroborate the importance of near eruption-aged zircon growth. Dates obtained at ~10 micrometers depth in zircon (representing &lt;60% crystal growth in most cases) are, however, 28 ka older than rim dates obtained in the same analytical session. The presence of these older zircon domains therefore warrants judicious care in the use of the Bishop Tuff for intercalibration between U-Pb and Ar/Ar dating methods.\n\nThe differences in age between the zircon rims and their interiors also has important implications for volcano monitoring. A possible scenario for evolution of the Bishop Tuff and the dynamics of zircon crystallization is as follows: (1) zircon nucleation and relatively rapid growth tens of thousands of years before eruption; (2) significant decrease or cessation of zircon growth altogether; followed by (3) mantling of earlier zircon cores by magma rejuvenation and renewed zircon growth during the lead-up to eruption. The magma reservoir responsible for the Bishop Tuff eruption would therefore have been restless for tens of thousands of years before supervolcano eruption, and there must have been sufficient time (tens of years) during the last episode of unrest for detectable zircon growth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary R Reid"
