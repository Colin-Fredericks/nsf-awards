 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sense of taste is used by all organisms to determine whether potential food items will be ingested or rejected and is critical for an organism's survival.  The taste system is made up of multiple cell types that detect chemicals in food and then send a specific signal describing that stimulus to the brain.  The goal of this project is to characterize recently identified signaling pathway in taste cells that contributes to the detection of taste stimuli.  Characterization of these signaling pathways will provide a better understanding of how the taste system works and how the brain gathers information about its surroundings.  \r\n\r\n\tA combination of calcium imaging, molecular biology, and immunocytochemistry will be used to better understand these recently identified signaling pathways and define their physiological role in the formation of taste signals that are sent to the brain.  The findings that emerge from this project will improve understanding of how taste receptor cells that are located on the tongue can detect chemicals in food and translate that information into a signal that the brain can understand. This information is critical for two reasons:  1) understanding how chemicals are detected from the environment has important implications in feeding behaviors including the regulation of food intake, and 2) information about the physiology of these neuronal cells will translate into a better understanding of how signaling pathways function in all neurons.  \r\n\r\n\tThis broader impacts of this project include provision of research and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate students, including both minorities and women.  Students will be trained in molecular biology and immunocytochemical techniques as well as live cell calcium imaging and patch clamp analysis of taste cells.  These skills will provide students with the ability to answer research questions (either in the taste field or elsewhere) using a multi-faceted approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of how taste  cells function.  Taste cells are located on the tongue; they function to detect the chemicals in our food and then send a signal to the brain.  This lets the brain know what is in our mouth so it can decide if we should eat it or spit it out.  The ability to consume nutritious and avoid potentially poisonous food is required for survival.  Because it is so important for survival, every living organism has the ability to detect chemicals from the environment and decide to consume it or reject it.\n\nHowever, we do not have a very good understanding of how the taste cells in the tongue function because there are multiple types of cells that detect different chemicals.  Some cells detect sour or salty stimuli and use a specific signaling pathway to transmit those signals.  Different cells detect bitter, sweet or umami (detection of proteins) stimuli and use different signaling pathways.  This makes it very complicated to get figured out.  It is important to understand how the taste system works because when it stops working, problems arise.  Multiple studies have shown that loss of the taste system results in malnutrition and weight loss that can lead to death.  More recent studies have shown that overeating is linked to a disfunctional taste system, so there is a very strong relationship between taste and consumption.\n\nThere are several proteins that have been shown to be very important in the transduction of bitter, sweet and umami taste stimuli.  Two of these proteins are called PLCb2 and TRPM5.  One study reported that loss of either of these two proteins caused the complete loss of the abiltiy to detect bitter, sweet or umami stimuli.  However, other studies found that loss of either of these proteins caused a reduced, but not abolished, ability to detect these stimuli.  We wanted to study this further to see if we could figure out what is required to transmit these taste stimulus signals in the taste cells.  We found that there are some other proteins that can substitute for PLCb2 and TRPM5.  They are called PLCb3 and TRPM4.  They are similar to PLCb2 and TRPM5 and function in very much the same manner.  We found that PLCb3 and TRPM4 are also contributing to taste cell signaling and must be present for normal transmission of bitter, sweet and umami stimuli.  This is a new finding for the taste field and gives us a better understanding of how taste cells function.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathryn Medler"
