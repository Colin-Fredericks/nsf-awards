 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis dissertation makes two main theoretical contributions. First, the theory provides an explanation for contemporary patterns of descriptive representation in the legislature. Second, Party Fit Theory has implications that extend beyond the realm of descriptive representation and politics.\u00a0 The theory offers an additional explanation for the persistence of polarization.\u00a0 Party Fit Theory suggests that it may be difficult to elect moderate candidates to a polarized political environment.\u00a0 This dissertation advances both the representation and partisan polarization literatures.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation seeks to explain partisan differences in representation by developing a theory of Party Fit.  Party Fit Theory suggests that a party's ideological reputation sends messages about the type of candidate that belongs in the party.  This project focuses on three mechanisms to explain differences in descriptive representation.  The first hypothesis explores patterns of attraction among potential members of the legislature.  The second hypothesis analyzes patterns of retirement among members of legislature.  The third hypothesis examines patterns of support from party activists.  A notable feature of the project is that Party Fit Theory is tested on data from within and outside the legislature, whereas previous research tends to focus on one or the other in isolation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact of the Research\r\n\r\nThis research contributes to the broader academic and non-academic communities.  The findings will be presented at academic conferences and submitted to scholarly journals, and the datasets generated will be made publicly available to scholars.  In the future, the Co-PI will teach classes on representation, and the research will enhance the teaching, training, and learning of undergraduate and graduate students.  The project also has important consequences for American politics and the quality of representative democracy.  We must consider how partisan dynamics affect the election of representatives.  This dissertation provides the most complete picture to date of the impact of partisan polarization on representation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past thirty years, two developments have altered the makeup of the U.S. Congress.  The first and more widely recognized of these is the rise in partisan polarization.  In the current 114th Congress, there is no ideological overlap between the two parties, and the distance between the Republican and Democratic parties is now at a post-Reconstruction high.  The second development has, by contrast, gone largely unnoticed: the number of Democratic women in Congress has increased dramatically while the number of Republican women has barely grown.  Women in Congress are now more than three times as likely to be Democrats, but just thirty years ago, women were evenly distributed between the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nMy dissertation develops a theory of party fit to explain both of these trends.  First, I show that patterns of candidate entry contribute to partisan polarization in Congress.  Scholars have focused almost exclusively on ideological changes in the electorate and procedural changes within Congress to explain the growing ideological gulf between the two parties.  By comparison, we know little about who runs for Congress and how the ideological makeup of the candidate pool has contributed to the rise in polarization.  I analyze state legislators in the congressional pipeline, and I find that liberal Republican and conservative Democratic state legislators are less likely to run for Congress than those at the ideological poles.  This is important because if the only candidates who run for Congress emerge from the ideological extremes, it is difficult to see how polarization will fade anytime soon.\n\nSecond, because Republican women have historically been to the ideological left of their male counterparts, I suggest that the rightward shift of the GOP has had a negative effect on the representation of Republican women.  Conservative men dramatically outnumber conservative women in state legislative office, and the GOP women who were in Congress in the 1980s and 1990s were more likely to be ideological moderates than their male counterparts.  As the party shifted to the right, this disproportionately affected Republican women in the congressional pipeline as well as Republican women serving in congressional office.  More generally, scholars of gender and politics have overwhelmingly pursued party-blind and ideology-neutral theories to explain the dearth of women in politics.  Yet if the Democratic Party is the primary driver behind the advancement of women in politics, we must consider the impact of recent partisan dynamics on female candidates.  Thus, the focus on party fit enhances our understanding of over-time changes in the ideological and gendered makeup of Congress.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Danielle M Thomsen"
