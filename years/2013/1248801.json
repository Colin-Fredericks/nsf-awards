 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposal explores an innovative approach to improving math problem solving skills using a game-based peer-to-peer mobile learning platform. Mathematics education is struggling in the U.S today. By the time our students reach middle school, many of them are already disengaged with and even afraid of mathematics. Research shows that schools often emphasize low-level procedures over higher order problem-solving skills and learners are taught using a top-down, one-strategy-fits-all approach. However, students bring their own strategies and techniques to problem solving and need opportunities to share these processes and get effective feedback. In Phase I, the firm will prototype a mobile version of a social learning platform that supports a student's thinking and learning process for pre-algebra topics in grades 6-8. The core of the platform is the scaffolded creation, curation and evaluation of multimedia vignettes of a student's thought process. The Phase I research will focus on evaluating this approach and concept framework and developing data mining algorithms required to convert inherently qualitative information into measurable and actionable data.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers tremendous promise for changing math education and engagement both in and out of the classroom. The CueThink platform should help students develop confidence and skills in solving complex problems, refine their math communication and improve their meta-cognition through the review of other students work and equip teachers with real-world examples of multiple learning styles and typical student errors and misconceptions. This enables CueThink to harness a substantial market opportunity for online instructional technology for math both inside and outside the school classroom - $2.4 billion market in 5 years. In addition, the team has identified portable opportunities for their solution in special education and higher education STEM learning, both of which should have a strong positive social impact while offering a huge scale-up potential via new markets. The company team brings to the table a diverse mix of educational, technical and business skills that will be critical to successful commercialization of the proposed math education innovation.",
