 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four-year mixed methods research project investigates the processes by which students select into and out of fields of study and of how projects funded by STEP impact these processes.  Grounded in Eccles' expectancy value-model, the research study examines student pathways to STEM baccalaureate degrees and the impact of different types of interventions on those pathways across diverse students and STEM majors.   The research focuses on the relationships among student academic preparation, subjective expectations with respect to future academic performance, objective academic performance, the tasks values students ascribe to STEM courses and majors, and interpersonal relationships from which students may draw personal and academic support. The comparison group design based on stratified probability samples of first-time first-year students from the participating institutions results in representative samples of the population of entering first-time students.  The design includes two control groups and one treatment group to increase external validity:  One cohort includes only STEM students  who enter the university in the year prior to the start of the intervention designed by STEP Type I projects (control condition 1).  The second cohort of students includes STEM students who participate in STEP Type 1 activities (treatment condition) and those who do not (control condition 2). Data include institutional student records and student responses to surveys designed for the study. In addition, the project is constructing a data infrastructure for further research by researchers and use by STEP projects.",

This project will help the universities participating in the STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP) program learn from their own projects and disseminate this knowledge to a wider community of practitioners, researchers and policy makers to help universities like them broaden participation in STEM.\n\nThe project investigated the following research questions:\n\nWhat mechanisms underlie the success or failure of Type 1 projects to increase the number of students who enter and complete bachelor's degrees in STEM fields?\nHow do effects of project interventions vary for students in different sociodemographic subgroups, in particular by gender and race/ethnicity? \nHow do the impacts of project interventions differ across STEM fields?\n\n\nSome of the key preliminary findings by researchers include:\n\nAmong men and women who have the same preferences for an undergraduate major, men tie their choice to higher prospective earnings significantly more often than women do.\nLarge introductory STEM courses tend to have grading practices that benefit men and earned first year STEM grades account for about 17% of the gender gap in STEM major declaration.\nAmong students earning passing grades below an A in their first-year STEM courses, first-generation students are significantly less likely than their continuing-generation peers to persist in STEM.\nChanging majors further contributes to gender segregation. Women leave STEM fields after initially selecting these at lower rates than men\nPersonality attributes like grit and conscientiousness are modestly associated with STEM entrance and persistence.
