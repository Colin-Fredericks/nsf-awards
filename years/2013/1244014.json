 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe research objective of this project is to provide a thorough methodology for the creation of advanced networks of cellular mimics.  The natural world often exhibits elegant solutions to complex engineering problems, many of which are derived from phenomena exhibited at the cellular level.  It is possible to recreate some of these desired behaviors and provide insight into how networks of individual cells can display collective behaviors by creating networks of cellular mimics in the laboratory.  This multi-disciplinary project focuses on coupling experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to aid in the development of a multiscale model for predicting the behavior of these artificial cellular networks, focusing on their unique transduction capabilities and responses to various stimuli.  The approach will involve the creation of individual biomolecular unit cells, constructing a multiscale model for predicting the behavior of networks of these unit cells, validating the model through the experimental results, and applying the validated model towards more advanced systems demonstrating the potential in using cellular mimics as intelligent materials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe benefits of this multi-disciplinary research include a more in-depth understanding of cellular networks through theoretical, computational, and experimental efforts. The findings will provide insight into how cells work in parallel to achieve collective goals, and illustrate the potential for biologically-inspired approaches in engineering research by demonstrating how cellular mechanics may be harnessed for tackling complex problems.  These dual goals will aid in increasing collaboration between the biological and engineering worlds and may lead to further scientific discoveries through fresh perspectives.  Cells demonstrate the same characteristics as many traditional intelligent materials, and properly tailored networks of cellular mimics may offer possibilities for the design of new devices such as microactuators and sensors.   In addition, a new generation of biologically-minded engineers will be encouraged through high school and undergraduate seminars that highlight applications of biomimetic design.",
