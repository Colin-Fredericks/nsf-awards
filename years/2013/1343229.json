There will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on fundamental topics, as well as several outstanding postdocs giving short talks on their work.  The mini-courses and short talks will be on subjects central to geometric group theory, but will also explore connections with other fields, including dynamics, logic, topology, algebraic geometry and measure theory.  The topics of the in-depth mini-courses include dynamics and circle packings, hyperbolic geometry and expanders, and Thompson's groups.  The shorter talks will cover various topics in CAT(0) geometry, hyperbolic groups, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of current interest.\r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is a young and dynamic field of mathematics, studied by an international community of researchers.  Most of the workshop attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact with leading experts in the field.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe \"Young Geometric Group Theory 3\" (YGGT3) meeting was held January\n20--24, 2014 at the Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques\n(CIRM) at Luminy, France.  As the name suggests, this was the third\niteration of a very successful conference series, which aims to bring\ntogether a fairly large number of graduate students and early-career\nresearchers with a smaller group of more senior experts in the\nburgeoning field of geometric group theory.  The time is divided\nbetween mini-courses by the experts, shorter talks by the junior\nmathematicians, and discussions.\n\nGeometric group theory is a young and dynamic field of mathematics,\nwhich uses geometric and topological methods to solve algebraic\nproblems.  The solutions to these problems often reverberate in the\nfields which inspired the methods.  A recent example is the geometric\ngroup theoretic methods used in Agol's solution to the virtual Haken\nconjecture.\n\nThis particular conference brought together about 100 mathematicians\nfrom around the world.  This year's experts were Pierre-Emmanuel\nCaprace, Etienne Ghys, Hee Oh, and Juan Souto.  Caprace spoke on\nmetric geometry and locally compact groups; Oh spoke on dynamical\napplications to the study of circle packings; Souto spoke on the\ngeometry and topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds; Ghys gave an eclectic\nsequence of lectures on particular groups and their mysteries.\n\nMore details, including abstracts of all the talks and research\nstatements from most of the 96 registered participants, can be found\nat the website for the conference:\nhttp://math.univ-lille1.fr/~kassel/yggt3\n\n\nThis grant supported 17 US-based participants at YGGT3.  Fourteen\ngraduate students, two post-docs, and one of the senior speakers were\nsupported.  Over one-third of those supported by this grant were\nfemale mathematicians.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason F Manning"
