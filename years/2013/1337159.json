 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor T.K. Vinod from Western Illinois University and colleagues Brian Bellott, Jin Jin, Shaozhong Zhang and Rose McConnell will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The project is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and reactions of water-soluble hypervalent iodine reagents; (b) oxidative cleavage of alkenes using an in-situ generated aryliodonium ion with oxone as terminal oxidant; (c) design and development of green oxidation experiments for the classroom activities; (d) synthesis and characterization of cathespsin inhibitors; (e) NMR based equilibrium studies of 13C labeled leupeptin analogues; (f) synthesis of organoselenium antioxidants; (g) quantitative detection of heavy metals using a seleno or telluro fluorescent probe; (h) synthesis and study of tellurium and silicon containing macrocycles; (i) steric and electronic contributions of phosphines in catalytic systems; and (j) synthesis of fulleridophiles.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at Western Illinois University but also at collaborating institutions such as Quincy University and Carl Sandburg College.",
