 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innovation combines mobile technologies becoming more widely used in schools, an evidence-based beginning reading program with a long history of R&D and widespread use in many settings, ongoing student progress monitoring and assessment with results and instructional recommendations delivered in real time, and instructional supports that assist teachers, paraprofessionals, tutors, and parents in implementing effective, research-based teaching strategies to efficiently help children learn to read.  While substantial evidence supports computer use in education, most software used for reading provides only targeted skills practice and is \"non-instructional\". The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications are innovative because they (a) include a complete evidence-based reading curricula that is well-aligned with research-based teaching and learning strategies and common core reading standards; (b) incorporate regular assessment to promote mastery of reading skills; (c) adapt based on student responses and assessment data to best meet students' needs; (d) include on-demand assistance to instructors to effectively implement the program; (e) provide a simple yet elegant interface that incorporates universal design features and promotes effective use of technology for teaching; and (f) remain a cost-effective alternative for efficiently teaching beginning reading skills.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications is based on a demonstrated ability to change reading outcomes. Many students are at high risk for reading failure and need effective intervention in early grades. The Nation's Report Card indicates 67% of fourth graders have only partial mastery of reading skills and are struggling readers. Substantial evidence shows struggling readers are more likely to drop out before graduating, become incarcerated, and experience lifelong economic loss leading to poorer health, family, and social outcomes. Additionally, research shows that early literacy skills predict later math and science outcomes which are crucial for STEM participation. Societal implications are clear: early reading success promotes better outcomes throughout lives, while reading failure is costly to individuals and society. Yet, changing reading trajectories for struggling readers is challenging, pointing to a strong need for high-quality, intensive early reading instruction that incorporates research-based teaching and learning strategies. The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications have clear educational and societal significance.  They are cost effective, evidence-based, and provide innovative, adaptive, flexible and accessible mobile applications that parents and school staff can use to efficiently teach early reading skills.",
