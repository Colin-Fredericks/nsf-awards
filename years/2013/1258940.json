This instrument will complement existing micro-analytical tools at the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), University of Rhode Island (URI) and support specific studies including 1) investigations of the role of volatiles (H2O and CO2) in plate tectonic cycles and mantle melting, 2) study of the behavior and fluxes of carbon in the Earth?s upper mantle, 3) research on magma/ice/meltwater interactions at glaciated stratovolcanoes, 4) studies of the role of volatiles in submarine explosive volcanism, and (5) investigations of the interplay of biological and geological processes in Earth?s nearsurface environments.  The instrument will serve graduate students investigations at URI-GSO and the PIs plan outreach activities to expose regional Rhode Island science teachers with tools of modern geoscience research. \r\n\r\n***",
