On a daily basis, the ethos of a nation is invoked in public discourse concerning current events, policies, scandals, and crises.  People commonly express allegiance to national values and ideas, even citing them as reasons to die for their country.  And yet, despite considerable speculation in the social sciences on how national cues might influence the citizenry in both subtle and obvious ways, there is surprisingly scarce empirical work revealing exactly how and when that happens. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research breaks new ground in understanding the implicit and explicit influence of symbols of nationalism on people's everyday attitudes, decisions, and behaviors.  The researchers plan to identify situations in which the implicit processing of cues to nationalism increases, versus decreases, prejudice and bias toward people of racial and ethnic outgroups.  The studies focus on helping behavior as an ecologically valid and important consequence of prejudice.  The proposed studies use cutting-edge as well as classical methods, in the lab and field, to test the implications this research for helping people from similar versus different racial and ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will produce a significant amount of research activity that will involve undergraduates, graduate students, and other faculty in a broadly collaborative effort.  The researcher is also developing a research lab website that will make available for download the data, tasks, and measures used in the research, in order to increase collaborative efforts and extensions.  The website will also have a significant public outreach component aimed at increasing the general public's knowledge of cutting edge research on nationalism, prejudice, and helping behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow do the ideals and values associated with a nation influence its citizens?  On a daily basis, the ethos of a nation is invoked in public discourse concerning current events, policies, scandals, and crises.  People commonly express allegiance to national values and ideas, even citing them as reasons to die for their country (e.g., Gellner, 2006).  And yet, despite considerable speculation in the social sciences on how national values might influence the citizenry in both subtle and obvious ways (e.g., Billig, 1995), there is surprisingly scarce empirical work revealing exactly how and when that happens.\n\n \n\nIn the research conducted for this grant, my colleagues and I examined the implicit and explicit influence of American cues on people?s everyday attitudes, decisions, and behaviors.  We focused on two critical questions.  The first was whether subtle exposure to American cues increases prejudice toward racial and ethnic groups.  The second was to examine potential explanations for the effects.  Overall, we discovered that the effects of subtle exposure to American cues changed over time.  Whereas such exposure resulted in increased politically conservative attitudes and beliefs (as well as prejudiced opinions) early in the grant period, such exposure has since shown no reliable main effect on these outcomes.  That is, subtle exposure to American symbols such as the national flag no longer seems to increase prejudice toward racial and ethnic outgroups.  We investigated a series of potential moderators for this main effect, including beliefs about government, types of news following, individual differences, and demographics, and although we found many promising leads on the kinds of people who show this kind of effect (from American cue exposure), we were not able to conclusively identify reliable moderators before the grant period ended. \n\n \n\nWe will be continuing this research (without NSF grant support) to examine the circumstances under which subtle exposure to common American symbols (such as the national flag) alters people?s attitudes, feelings, and intergroup behavior.  We also have extended our work to other countries, and are actively examining the effects of national cues on attitudes and voting behavior in Israel.  This research has significantly advanced our understanding of how ideological symbols, such as flags, might influence people, and especially how the meaning of ideological cues is extremely rich and variable over time.  We think our findings contribute an important addition to theory in this area in terms of showing how ideological cues vary based on an assortment of variables including the political climate, the constituency of federal government, news media, and people?s changing motivations and allegiances. \n\n \n\nOur grant-supported research involved substantial collaboration and cooperation among dozens of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty.  We made sure to invite the participation of undergraduate participants across a spectrum of races, ethnicities, political affiliations, and socioeconomic statuses.  We also depended on the support and participation of over a dozen undergraduate students who worked in the lab as research assistants, programmers, and lab managers.  We disseminated our findings at multiple national and international conferences, and are about to submit for publication a manuscript describing some of our results. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melissa J Ferguson"
