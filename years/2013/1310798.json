 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Jennifer Apell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The project title is \"Comparison of Food Web Models Constructed with Traditional and Passive Sampling Data.\" The host scientist is Dr. Barry Kelly.\r\n\r\nFood web modeling, which allows for the prediction of chemical concentrations in biota based on concentrations measured in sediments, water, or air, is often used for remediation decisions and to establish cleanup goals for contaminated sites. Yet, the accuracy of the model is dependent on how well the contamination is characterized. Traditional sediment sampling techniques often incorrectly estimate the concentration of contaminants that are readily accumulated by biota, which is referred to as the bioavailable fraction. However, passive samplers, constructed of a polymeric material, can act as surrogate for biota and have been shown to be a more accurate estimate of the bioavailable concentration. This research uses contaminant concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, measured using both traditional and passive sampling techniques, in a Gobas food web model to compare the outcomes as well as evaluate the impact these sampling techniques have on the model.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, results from this research could lead to innovation in the way contaminated sediment sites are evaluated and remediated. Findings will be presented to parties involved in the remediation of Superfund sites as well as graduate and undergraduate students at MIT.",
