 "awd_abstract_narration": "1321470 (Davis). Smart Manufacturing (SM) is integrating network-based data and information that comprises the real-time understanding, reasoning, planning and management of all aspects of a manufacturing and supply chain enterprise. SM is facilitated through use of advanced sensor-based data analytics, modeling and simulation in real-time. SM is about game-changing potential to energize innovation, address productivity, achieve new and structurally different performance goals, and drive the competitive advantage of investments in plant assets. Unfortunately, a cost effective infrastructure to integrate real-time manufacturing intelligence and active management across the control systems of an entire production operation does not exist today. This is the ultimate aim of the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC). SMLC has been formed around a set of goals that no one company can accomplish alone. SMLC enables stakeholders in the smart manufacturing industry to form collaborative R & D, implementation and advocacy teams for development of the approaches, standards, platforms and shared infrastructure that facilitate the broad utilization of manufacturing intelligence. The SMLC is a non-profit organization committed to overcome barriers to the development and deployment of SM Systems through development of a shared infrastructure called the Smart Manufacturing Platform (SM Platform). SMLC activities are built around joint industry and university-driven development, application and scaling of a shared infrastructure that will achieve transformational economic-wide impact, manufacturing innovation and global competitiveness. SMLC supports the manufacturing industry through pursuing a comprehensive technology that no one company can undertake. Without a modern industrial infrastructure, adoption of SM systems is not economically viable. Process control and automation systems implemented in a piecemeal fashion will continue to limit innovation and capability. SMLC will build the business, interoperability and technology models, demonstrations, infrastructure, and project teams across multiple industry segments. Through the SM Platform, SMLC will help companies address manufacturing-related challenges across the automotive, food, military, materials, chemical, oil and gas, refining, pharmaceutical, information technology, process control and automation industries. SMLC also supports collaborative research, development and commercialization. Education and workforce training resources for smart manufacturing will be developed for universities, technology schools, and small and medium manufacturers.",
