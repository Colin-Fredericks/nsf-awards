 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attributed-based obligatory access control is a new access control paradigm for achieving fine-grained authorization and assured system accountability. However, access control and obligation policies can be implemented incorrectly for various reasons, such as programming errors and misunderstanding about the policies. It is important to reveal discrepancy between the policy specification and the actual system implementation. The objective of this ?Transition To Practice? project is to develop an open source tool for model-based testing of attribute-based access control and obligation policies. It can build test models by integrating attribute-based access control and obligation rules with functional test models, generate test cases from the test models to meet given coverage criteria, and transform model-level test cases into executable code in a target language and test execution environment. The test code can then be executed with the system under test to exercise the access control and obligation policies. The tool is applicable to a great variety of systems due to the support for various programming languages and test execution environments. It is independent of how access control and obligation policies are implemented in the system under test. The broader impacts of this project include deployment of the tool to various academic and industry projects and involvement of students, particularly undergraduate students, in cutting-edge research.",

However, incorrect implementation of access control and obligation policy can lead to serious policy violations, such as unauthorized access and unfulfilled obligations. To reveal the potential discrepancy between the policy specification and the actual system implementation, this project has developed a tool-supported approach to model-based testing of attribute-based access control and obligation policies. This approach can build test models automatically by integrating access control and obligation rules with functional test models, generate test cases from the test models to meet various coverage criteria, and automatically transform model-level test cases into executable test code in a chosen target language and test execution environment, such as Java (JUnit) and C# (NUnit), and C/C++. The approach has been implemented in the open source project MISTA (Model-based Integration and System Test Automation). It is the first model-based testing tool for conformance verification of attribute-based access control and obligation policies. To evaluate the proposed approach, we have developed an open source web-based application, GPMS (Grant Proposal Management System), as a complete case study based on XACML. XACML is an industry-standard language for specifying attribute-based access control and obligation policies. GPMS allows an academic institution to manage the internal workflow of grant proposal submissions with fine-grained access control. Our experiment has demonstrated that the proposed model-based testing approach is effective for detecting defects in both XACML policy and policy enforcement code. In addition, this project has investigated methods for coverage-based test generation, fault localization, and automatic repair of XACML policies. The results of this project have led to 11 papers, including two journal articles, seven conference and workshop publications, and two manuscripts to be submitted for publication. The two open source projects, MISTA and GPMS, are publicly available. MISTA provides a new model-based approach to automated testing of attribute-based access control and obligation policies. GPMS can be used as a benchmark for the research community to investigate and evaluate techniques for quality assurance of access control and obligation policies specified in XACML. GPMS also serves as a real-world system for teaching security courses. This project has involved six undergraduate students in research through a REU supplement and an NSF REU summer program in Software Security. These students included two females, one minority, and three from institutions with limited research resources. In addition, two research associates sponsored by this project have started an academic career in cybersecurity.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dianxiang&nbsp;Xu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
