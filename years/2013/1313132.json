 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal brings together the theoretical and observational skills from two researchers to conduct a study of L-dwarfs, which are relatively cool brown dwarf stellar objects.  They will use optical and infrared spectroscopy and photometry of approximately thirty L- dwarfs to constrain and revise models of the atmospheres and evolution of low mass stellar objects. They will use archive data from Spitzer IRAC and 2MASS surveys, and new data from a 1.3-m telescope in Chile and 2.4-m MDM telescope. They will focus on determining accurate values of effective temperature, mass and metallicity of the dwarfs, and to better understand why many young brown dwarfs are not as luminous as models predict.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the research training of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups from the City University of New York system, supporting the AstroBetter blog, producing planetarium videos and other public outreach activities through the American Museum of Natural History.\r\n",

Brown dwarfs are objects that form like stars do, from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, but without enough mass to reach a high enough core temperature to stably generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium. Thus brown dwarfs cool, shrink, and fade with time. Brown dwarf spectral classes include M, L, T, and Y dwarfs, and they overlap in observational properties as well as in atmospheric and physical properties with young, high-mass exoplanets. This project focused on the warmest brown dwarfs, L dwarfs, for which solid condensates (dust) are expected to contribute significantly to their atmospheric and observational properties. Young, cool M dwarfs are estimated to have substellar masses and dusty atmospheres so they were also included in several studies.</p>\n<p>Dr. Filippazzo&rsquo;s thesis project focused on deriving the fundamental parameters of nearly 200 brown dwarfs using their distance-calibrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which describe their energy output over a broad range of wavelengths at low resolution. Using SEDs, Dr. Filippazzo determined the overall power output (bolometric luminosity) of each object, from which he could infer a surface temperature and mass, assuming a value for radius estimated from evolutionary models, often constrained by an independently-determined age. These measurements are as close to empirical as possible for single objects. This project produced age-sensitive relationships of luminosity, temperature, and absolute magnitude as functions of spectral type and absolute magnitude to disentangle the effects of degenerate physical parameters of temperature, surface gravity, and clouds on spectral morphology. It also characterized the longer-wavelength reddening of low gravity L dwarfs and identified a systematically cooler temperature of up to 300 K from field age objects of the same spectral type and 400 K cooler from field age objects of the same intrinsic brightness.</p>\n<p>This project has supported numerous undergraduate student researchers working on projects related to the scientific goals of this grant. Most student researchers were from the City University of New York, and one was from Barnard College. In addition to performing analysis related to their projects, research students participated in on site and/or remote observing, presented their work in talks and as posters at numerous student and professional research conferences, and participated in various education and outreach activities relevant to their personal interests and communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>This project combined an unprecedented observational dataset with foundational model atmospheres to determine the fundamental parameters of a large, diverse sample of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, providing a framework for understanding the properties of young, high-mass exoplanets. The work defined and described &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; brown dwarfs both in terms of their observational properties and their atmospheric and physical properties. The work increased the number of young brown dwarfs with ages constrained by membership in nearby young moving groups of young stars, and established methods for understanding these objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Both the PI and the student were active in education and public outreach during the duration of the grant period.

Dr. Filippazzo is now a Research &amp; Instrument Analyst at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and several undergraduate student researchers, all identifying as members of groups historically
