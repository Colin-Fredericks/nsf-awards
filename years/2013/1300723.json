Specifically, Prof. Saykally and his group will probe water clusters produced in the laboratory with modern THz light sources.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the work by Professor Saykally and his group is to develop a better quantitative understanding of the complex interactions in water.  Results of this work could have profound impacts in biology and environmental science.   In addition, Prof. Saykally will help to train a new generation of scientists skilled in cutting-edge research.  Prof. Saykally and his colleagues are also involved in scientific outreach, including the Math, Science and Engineering Resource Support (MASERS) program, which brings hands-on science activities and science professionals into middle schools in the San Francisco Bay area.",
