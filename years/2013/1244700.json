 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is integrating concept mapping, laboratory instrumentation, and the 5E learning cycle to improve student conceptual understanding in a foundational course on engineering dynamics. Engineering dynamics is typically a high enrollment course nationally and is required of students in Mechanical, Aerospace, Civil, and Bio Engineering programs. One study indicated that national success rates in dynamics is approximately 53%. Because the course is taken early in the undergraduate program, poor performance can often be the cause of low graduation rates. This project is meeting three goals: (1) improve student conceptual understanding of dynamics, (2) cultivate student interest in learning dynamics, and (3) to understand if and to what extent the use of the proposed pedagogical model impacts student learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis project is the first of its kind to integrate these three proven instructional approaches to improve student conceptual understanding in dynamics. Building on previous work this study will have a national impact on STEM education.\r\n\r\nAssessment instruments contain both quantitative and qualitative components and the study includes control and quasi-experimental groups utilizing pre and post testing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDisclaimer\n\nThis Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project integrated concept mapping, hands-on real-world laboratory instrumentation, and the 5E learning cycle to improve student conceptual understanding in engineering dynamics, a second-year foundational course required in many undergraduate engineering programs, such as mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, civil engineering, and bioengineering. The course covers numerous foundational concepts and requires students to have a solid conceptual understanding for effective problem solving.      \n\nIn this project, undergraduate student participants who took engineering dynamics courses at the PI?s institution generated a set of concept maps for them to better understand the relationships among various concepts and see the big picture in engineering dynamics.  The results from both quantitative and qualitative assessments have shown that students had positive experiences with concept mapping as well as improved conceptual understanding.  The top four reasons that students liked concept mapping include: helped make connections between concepts, helped visualize concepts, helped review what students had learned, and helped organize concepts.  For example, a student stated that \"The concept maps were a good review of the material from each chapter.  Making the maps gave me the opportunity to review the material I had learned and check my understanding of each concept.\"         \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project provided valuable training opportunities for graduate students to get involved in engineering education research, such as quantitative and qualitative assessments.  This project also provided undergraduate student participants with a new learning experience.  Many undergraduate student participants did not have any prior experiences to develop their own concept maps.  By participating in this project, undergraduate students were provided opportunities to generate their own concept maps.  Analysis on these student-generated concept maps helps the engineering education community to better understand how students learn engineering concepts and how they perceive the relationships among various concepts in engineering.        \n\nThe project results were disseminated to the national and international community of engineering education.  For example, the project results were disseminated through journal publications, such as in International Journal of Engineering Education, as well as either oral or poster presentations at relevant professional conferences, such as the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference &amp; Exposition.  These journal and conference papers have reached a wide range of audience, involving not only engineering educators and administrators but also researchers in STEM education, especially in engineering education.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ning Fang"
