 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding to evaluate the feasibility of producing vertically aligned bulk heterojunctions by combining screen-printing and lyotropic liquid crystal processing. The proposed research includes three key aspects related to this liquid crystalline printing. First, novel core-shell hybrid nanowires will be synthesized by chemically grafting conjugated polymers onto inorganic nanowires. Lyotropic liquid crystalline behaviors of the resulting rod-like hybrids will be determined with variations of concentration, solvent and temperature. Second, rheological tests will be performed to optimize formulation of liquid crystalline ink for appropriate alignment during the screen-printing process. In particular, studies on viscosity, thixotropy and viscoelasticity of printable nanowire ink will guide further development of screen-printing for high throughput production. Third, processes of screen-printing for producing vertically aligned bulk heterojunctions of liquid crystal ink will be developed in a well-controlled manner. The processing-structure-property correlations will be established to optimize the materials properties.\r\n \r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to the creation of a new paradigm, which will have a profound impact on the production of solar energy devices. The vertically aligned bulk heterojunction is an ideal morphology and structure required for high efficiency hybrid photovoltaic cells. The new approach of the liquid crystalline printing developed in this research will be of significant importance for the manufacture of large-scale, cost-effective, high-performance polymer-based hybrid photovoltaic cells that would revolutionize renewable energy generation. A reliable analysis of the processing-structure-property correlations will provide a foundation for the optimization of new multifunctional nanomaterials that can be utilized in various energy generation and conversion systems. This interdisciplinary award makes contributions to the fields of nanomaterials, liquid crystals, polymers, organic electronics, coatings, and graphic printing.",
