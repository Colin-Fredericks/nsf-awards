 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although physicists have wrestled for decades about how to teach quantum physics to physics majors, little research and development has focused on helping engineering students begin developing the conceptual understandings, problem-solving approaches, and habits of mind they need to become nanotechnology designers or engineers working in the quantum realm. In this project, a collaborative team is (1) refining previously developed curricular modules on quantum physics aimed at sophomore through senior level engineering students, (2) developing extensive supporting materials for instructors, to help them adapt and implement the modules to meet the needs of their students, and (3) doing research and evaluation on students' learning with these materials, across a range of different types of institutions.\r\n\r\nIn refining and assessing the curricular modules, all of which have been classroom tested, the project focuses on students' ontological conceptions about quantum-scale phenomena and devices.  \"Ontological conceptions\" means the ways in which students associate particle or wave (or other) ideas with physical scenarios, and with entities such as electrons, light, photons, and atoms, while solving problems. Ontological conceptions are particularly salient in quantum physics, where experts adeptly juggle \"particle\" and \"wave\" pictures of quantum entities, all while remaining aware that quantum entities are completely neither of the two. Prior research shows that expert engineering design and engineering/physics problem-solving, including quantitative problem solving, build on solid conceptual underpinnings and metacognitive sophistication. For this reason, the project studies not only whether students become more sophisticated quantum reasoners, but also how students' conceptions and metacognitive awareness do and do not shift in response to instructional and contextual cues. This research provides insights that inform (1) the refinement of the curricular modules and (2) the creation of supporting materials for instructors, who can better adapt and implement our modules given a well-articulated \"theory\" and patterns of student reasoning underlying our instructional choices. As part of this research and evaluation, the project is developing on-line assessment tools for probing students' ontological conceptions and problem-solving skills in quantum mechanics. These tools are being used across all participating institutions and also are of more general use to instructors and researchers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Development of assessment tools and of resources for instructors is happening in tandem with the refinement of the curricular modules, all informed by research designed to illuminate mechanisms of learning about the quantum realm. This research combines large-group surveys with detailed video analysis of students using the materials and addressing difficult problems in both classroom and clinical settings. The development of materials is also guided by feedback from faculty focus groups that include engineers engaged in nano-scale work as well as exemplary quantum physics instructors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Previous research shows that incorporating collaborative active learning into engineering courses improves not only achievement but also retention, particularly of women and underrepresented minority students. Since students aiming for careers in nanotechnology, surface science, or solid-state materials and devices increasingly need a deep understanding of quantum physics, upper-division modern physics courses aimed primarily at engineering majors are becoming more common. Therefore, by helping such courses incorporate collaborative active learning, this project is increasing both the size and the diversity of the workforce capable of generating and harnessing cutting-edge discoveries at the nano scale.",
