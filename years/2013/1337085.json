Student participation in SoCS encourages young investigators in their research in combinatorial search.  This symposium carries on a tradition of bringing together researchers and students around issues of pattern-database heuristics, inconsistent heuristics, real-time search, path-finding for physical robots and computer-game agents, parallel search, and search using external memory.  These search techniques have a significant place in broader AI application in areas such as robotics, computer games, planning, and bioinformatics.  In addition, SoCS 13 includes a special focus on graph search engineering.",
