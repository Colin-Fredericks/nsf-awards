 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study the details of ionospheric source dynamics through synergistic use of two- and three- dimensional models and new estimation schemes involving both incoherent scatter radar and optical spectrograph data. High-latitude ionospheric plasma density and structure play a critical role in the coupled terrestrial ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) system. Experimental and modeling studies have convincingly demonstrated the presence of heavy ions of ionospheric origin in various magnetospheric regions, and that these heavy ions appreciably affect response of the ITM system to solar wind forcing. The ionospheric source and its dynamics play a substantial role in modulating this ion outflow process. This research will directly address several gaps in the current ability to observe the composition of the high-latitude ionospheric plasma and our understanding of the temporally dynamic nature of heating events and associated transients governing composition, ionospheric upflows, and the generation of mesoscale and small-scale ionospheric plasma density structures. Specific science objectives will be to provide detailed data-model analyses to determine the: (1) Location and intensity of storm-time ionospheric sources for molecular ion outflow (2) Contributions of molecular ion recombination, current closure depletion, and ion upflows to plasma loss in realistic auroral current systems (3) Time scales on which major ionospheric loss and transport processes operate, including the effects of electromagnetic induction in highly dynamic situations (4) Effects of three-dimensional current system geometries on ionospheric transport and loss, and the role of these processes in the development of smaller-scale irregularities (5) Temporal dependence of low altitude upflow, including transients in upflow initiation and finite propagation times to higher altitudes, and possible influence of some types of wave-particle interactions on upflow. The early career scientist leading this project will focus on supporting a new PhD program in Engineering Physics at ERAU, including funding of students completing MS and PhD theses, and refinement of the PI's MS and PhD courses to include contemporary space physics research topics where appropriate, and student research projects. Efforts to support undergraduate research will continue through funded summer projects, independent studies, and development of a new, year-long senior thesis option for highly qualified students. This project will support and further develop new and existing academic programs, is heavily pitched toward both undergraduate and graduate student involvement, and is specifically intended to work in concert with the university-wide student research initiative IGNITE. Research results will be made available through prompt publication, and it is anticipated that many of the contributions will yield student-authored papers. The research undertaken will represent an international collaboration with both European and South American institutions supporting some aspects of the work. Methods developed for addressing the science goals above (i.e. models and estimation schemes), will likely serve as useful tools for the community to use in other related studies.",
