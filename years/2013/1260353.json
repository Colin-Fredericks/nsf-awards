The experiments were designed to examine hydrological and biological processes in basaltic ocean crust. Major issues to be addressed include overall permeability, the magnitudes, velocity and directions of fluid, solute,and heat transport,constraints on the fluid storage properties of crust, determining how fluid reservoirs respond to seismic perturbations, and investigating the variability, diversity, and metabolism of resident microbial populations. This project will recover sensors and samplers in the instrumented boreholes(CORKs),access data and samples, collect biological incubators placed at depth within the boreholes, and seal the CORKs. All of these activities are needed for the completion of the JDFR experiments\r\n\r\nOnce the data and samples are retrieved, the PI's will develop new numerical models for the hydrology (permeability, thickness and extent of permeable zones, connectivity, direction of flow, and anisotropy) of ocean crust based on the results of flow tests. T sensors will enable thermal structure to be determined in conjunction with flow parameters. DNA will be analyzed via ?16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes as well as select full-length Sanger-style sequencing and gene fingerprinting techniques.? The PI's will look at diversity, shared species, emergence and disappearance of groups. Metagenomic work will be done on some samples.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts include training of 4 shipboard educators, with an emphasis on recruiting underrepresented groups for these positions, teacher workshops, and special training for undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs. Research team includes grads, undergrads, and post-docs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    This multi-PI from multiple institutions project began about a decade ago with initial planning and developmental engineering with the primary objective of improving our knowledge about the largest aquifer system in the world, the upper ocean crust.  In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this study will help other studies of the deep microbial biosphere and the thermal and the chemical evolution of the solid earth.  Finally, it also utilized and further developed subseafloor boreholes (CORKs) installed by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP and its subsequent reincarnations, including IODP&mdash;the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program).\n\n    The UCSB portion was dedicated to a multi-borehole tracer (chemical dye) experiment that began in August 2010 during IODP Expedition 327.  During that expedition, two new boreholes were drilled in 3.5 million year old seafloor oriented N20&deg;E, 100 km east of the Endeavor Segment on the Juan de Fuca Spreading Ridge in the Northeastern Pacific (Holes #1362A and #1362B) and installed with 3rd generation CORKs.  A 24-hour pumping test was conducted in Hole #1326B prior to the installation of its CORK.  For 20 hours of the pumping test, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer was added to the injection water.  Although a strong greenhouse gas, SF6 is an ideal tracer in this setting because it is non-reactive, can be measured at low concentrations using a gas chromatograph in small samples (~1 ml), and background concentrations in natural waters are extremely low (&lt; 1 fmol/L; 1 fmol = 1 x 10-15 mol).  Samples were collected from four boreholes (Holes #1301A, #1362B; #1362A; and #1026B) using Osmosamplers in gas tight copper tubes. Osmosamplers are passive pumps that collect about 1 ml of borehole water per day. These samplers are designed to exploit osmosis by separating fresh and saline water reservoirs with semipermeable membranes, collecting and storing samples for years in remote environments without electrical power or moving parts.\n\n    In addition to serving as an educational and research tool for three B.S., one M.S., and one Ph.D. students, major results include: 1) detecting tracer at all four boreholes, 2) verifying a dominant natural flow direction from south to north, 3) quantifying the effective porosity of the upper ocean crust aquifer, and 4) confirming the suspected anisotropy of the field location.  The tracer study showed that 1) the effective porosity is very low (&lt;&lt;1%), which means that hydrothermal flow is restricted to &lt;&lt;1% of the aquifer volume and 2) the effective porosity parallel is at least 10 times higher than perpendicular to the spreading ridge, presumably due to larger and more extensive faulting in the ridge parallel direction.  These results have important implications for the hydrogeology of the upper ocean crust on ridge flanks, and for fractured and heterogeneous water-rock systems more broadly, including those high-temperature systems near seafloor spreading centers and in the continental crust.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jordan F Clark"
