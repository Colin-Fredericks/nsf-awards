 "awd_abstract_narration": "1338154\r\nFerguson\r\n\r\nThe proposed system facilitates multimodal analysis of a single ROI on one modular platform by integrating an Atomic Force Microscope, an Ultra Nanoindentation Tester (max depth = 100 \u00ecm; load = 50 mN), a Nanoindentation Tester (1000 \u00ecm; 500 mN), and an optical microscope through which 2-D Raman microscopy (514 or 785 nm lasers) is performed. A high precision translation stage moves samples between modules. This proposed instrument will facilitate combined mechanical analysis, across multiple small length-scales, with determination of chemical composition at a single ROI. AFM and nanoindentation are well-established techniques for assessing stiff, conventional engineering materials. Yet most commercially available nanoindenters fail to accurately test materials that are hydrated, soft, or subjected to thermal changes. The CSM Instruments platform adeptly overcomes limitations of existing indenter systems by using one independent probe to find a sample's surface and continuously monitor thermal drift while a second probe indents the sample - critical for soft or fluid-like surfaces. Integration with a Raman microscope will facilitate combined analysis of mechanical behavior and materials chemistry in one exact ROI. Acquisition of this system at CU Boulder will inform design of cutting-edge materials in an unparalleled fashion and enhance our activities in world-class materials research.",
