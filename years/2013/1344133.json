 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Special Projects program of the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, both in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the the Petrology and Geochemistry Program in the Division of Earth Science in the Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis project combines cutting-edge research from two intellectually distinct areas (astronomy and geochemistry) in order to significantly advance understanding of how terrestrial planets form and develop a biosphere.  The main goal focuses on how dominant carbon-bearing molecules in the solar nebula were incorporated into the primordial Earth and how they were geologically cycled between the planet?s interior and atmosphere.  This work will constrain models of carbon delivery to the Earth by combining astronomical observations of planet-forming disks (with ALMA and Keck observatories), laboratory experiments involving molten lava, and astrochemical modeling of carbon-bearing compounds in the solar nebula.  \r\n\r\nThe astronomers will use the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter ARRAY (ALMA) and Keck Observatory to obtain radio and infrared spectra, respectively, of carbon-bearing molecules in circumstellar disks to measure how the carbon budget is allocated between molecules in the gas and solid phase, and how much of it is destroyed (or chemically reduced) by starlight irradiation.  In parallel, the geochemists will conduct experiments in order to better understand how carbon cycles between the interior and surface, which plays a large role in maintaining Earth?s biosphere.  Their experiments focus on the chemical exchange between material from the surrounding planet-forming environment and the molten silicate surface of the young Earth. The experiments will subject samples made from carbonaceous chondrites (from Allende and Homestead meteorites) to varying temperatures and pressures and then measure solubility and partitioning of carbon. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will work with graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in their research, and with teachers in the K-12 system through introductory courses and web-interface tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project seeks to explore the origin of our inhabited planet and lies within the cross-cutting boundaries of Astrophysics, Planetary Sciences, and Geophysics.  Our interdisciplinary team seeks to explore the origin of life-fostering carbon and nitrogen on terrestrial worlds through direct research within each discipline but crucially by working together across disciplines to reveal new insight into Earth's origin but also other potential \"Earths\" waiting to be discovered.  \n\nOur work has explored the disposition of carbon and nitrogen through the origin in interstellar space, into the young planet-forming disk, within the building blocks of planets, and finally within young planets with magma oceans and early atmospheres.    Within astronomy we explored the chemical evolution of carbon and nitrogen in two forms: carbon-rich refractory solids with low volatility and carbon-rich organics with moderate volatility.   Carbon-rich refractories are found to be so abundant that they would lead to the formation of carbon-rich planets and not Earth-like worlds.  Thus we focus on the destruction mechanisms for these solids which we find are prevalent on the surface of the protoplanetary disk within the formation zones of terrestrial worlds.   To explore carbon in forms of higher volatility, we use the newly commissioned Atacama Large Millimeter Array to set limits on the carbon content of young gas-rich planet-forming disks.  We find that carbon appears to be missing from the gas-phase, hinting at vast reservoirs of carbon rich solids in the outer parts of solar systems.  Within geophysics we explored the chemical storage and behavior of C and N in silicate magmas, and molten or crystalline iron-rich alloys.  The results place constraints on the core as a potential host of C and N as well as on the effects of these elements on physical properties.  Combined with geochemical modeling of core formation and outgassing, the data suggest that C delivered to the growing Earth may be largely in the core.  Nitrogen is also likely concentrated in the core, but was possibly expelled preferentially by atmospheric loss.  Accretion of differentiated planetesimals may also have played an important role in acquisition of these crucial ingredients.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, our team worked to combine these pieces together to form a more complete picture of how worlds like the Earth are born with carbon and nitrogen present on their surfaces.  Here we found that the critical stages involve loss of carbon relative to nitrogen during the early stages of planetary accretion, followed by preferential loss of nitrogen from the proto-Earth under oxidizing conditions.   Our results suggest that planets like the Earth are readily supplied with these key elements, but their relative amounts on the surface and in the atmosphere will be highly variable.\n\nThroughout this project our diverse team members promulgated these results to numerous world-class scientific conferences and seminars.  Furthermore, this project has led to the training of over 10 young scientists who represent the future of STEM leaders for our country.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edwin Bergin"
