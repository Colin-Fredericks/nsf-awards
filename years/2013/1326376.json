The objective of the research is to obtain a better understanding of the reasons why people fail to take advantage of available information in strategic settings.  The PI develops new models that organize observations about how people share and use information.  He then works out the formal implications of these models and frames hypotheses that can be used to test the models and distinguish between them.  This project contributes to game theory, develops concepts and a taxonomy to give rigorous foundation to ideas about coordination, conventions, argumentation, and social comparison, and suggests ways to structure economic environments to improve performance.  \r\n\r\nFailures to share information within and between groups can lead to significant costs in the decision making of committees, juries, and corporations.  The research will provide new insight into how to structure the organizing rules of such committees to reduce communication failures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\nThe research focused on understanding how people communicate in strategic settings.  One collection of papers examined conditions under which people take advantage of opportunities to communicate effectively.  Misunderstandings and failures to coordinate are possible (both in practice and in theory) even when economic actors have strong motivations to coordinate.  The proposal studied how common understanding of the way that people use natural language.  Modeling common understanding as a restriction on how people use words, the research provides mathematical conditions under which communication will be effective.  These qualitative results hold in two related contexts: in situations in which people talk about what they intend to do and in situations in which they talk about what they know.\n\nThe study of the problem led to a conceptual puzzle about the structure of equilibria in an abstract games.  Solving the puzzle led to  results that characterize equilibria in a new class of environments that involve families of games with complementarities. \n\n A related part of the project studied lying costs.  People are more honest than naive economic theory predicts.  That is, many people will avoid telling lies even when lies and financially profitable.  A natural hypothesis is that lying is costly.  The project sought to identify the nature of these costs.  The possibilities considered are that lying cost are related to the financial gain available; they are related to some measure of the distance between what is true and what is said; or they are related to how likely the students are to be viewed as dishonest. Experiments provide convincing evidence for the second and third type of cost.   \n\nTo summarize, the intellectual merits of the research conducted are new results identifying sufficient conditions for effective communication, new results about a novel class of \"interval dominance supermodular games,\" a taxonomy on lying costs, and evidence about which types of cost are relevant in practice.  \n\nThe research is theoretical, but it is related to substantive issues.  Its broader impacts are guidelines for how to structure communication to take advantage of individual willingness to tell the truth.  To the extent that it identifies conditions under which communication is effective, it provides guidance that helps understand the causes of communication failure and ways to remedy it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel Sobel"
