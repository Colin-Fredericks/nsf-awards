 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nThe importance of affordable and high efficiency technologies for renewable energy has been well established and there is a demand for scientifically and technologically competent students who have sufficient experience in research methods, ethics, and teamwork for them to pursue advanced technology careers. To address these needs, an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program focused on Renewable Energy Generation and Storage will be established on the Binghamton University, State University of New York campus. Working with the Center for Autonomous Solar Power (CASP), an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineering faculty, this REU program will bring up to 10 STEM undergraduate students (sophomore and junior level) and two STEM faculty from four-year colleges together each year for a 9-week summer experience in a stimulating and supportive research environment. A special focus will be placed on incorporating students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines with a plan to reach >50% minority and female participation, and to accomplish this goal, the REU site will work with established minority serving partner institutions. Along with conducting research, the students will participate in education and training programs to support their professional development, present their work to industry members of the CASP technical advisory board, and have access to travel funds to present their work at professional meetings in the year following their experience. Support for this REU is provided by the National Science Foundation's Division of Materials Research. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nAffordable and efficient energy generation and storage is a critical technology for the future success of the U.S. and world economy. With the support of the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, this REU site will build a new research program at the Center for Autonomous Solar Power on the Binghamton University, State University of New York campus. Targeting undergraduate students from groups typically underrepresented in the science and engineering disciplines, a supportive and challenging research experience has been created for each participant that focuses on creating new solutions to current global energy challenges. Students will benefit from both carefully planned, open-ended experimental problems designed to yield significant results and the opportunity to contribute as a member of a research team to the scientific knowledge in their discipline. The program focuses on the development of the REU participants into future leaders in the science and engineering energy community.",
