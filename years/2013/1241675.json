The project develops a Cyber Scholars Program that expands the national IA academic reach to students throughout the Gulf Coast region, increasing diversity and capacity of the national cybersecurity workforce. The USA School of Computing (SoC) has three ABET-accredited computing programs, including a health informatics degree program that offers substantial interaction in IA and a unique opportunity to attract women into the computing field. The project collaborates with local minority institutions such as Bishop State Community College, a designated underrepresented institution, and other community colleges in the region, raising awareness of cybersecurity issues in a wide variety of rural communities. USA has a strong K-12 outreach program in partnership with industry and government agencies, including an annual GEMS (Girls Exploring Math & Science) conference for middle school girls and Summer Security Seminars for high school students.",

Of the awards under the grant, 71% were given to male students and 29% were female, with 13% of our cohort coming from underrepresented groups. Student recruitment during the award period has resulted in 76 applications with 41 scholarships offered and 40 awarded. Of those who applied for the program, 81% of applicants were existing USA students who were made aware of the program as a result of advertising, curriculum outreach, research initiatives, and public announcements. 19% of applicants were students at other universities and were made aware of the program though web-site advertising, direct mailing, press releases, media interviews, and PI presentations. Of our applicant pool, 44% were current undergraduate students and 56% were existing graduates students. Applicants also came from diverse academic backgrounds which includes 76% from STEM-based majors (e.g. CS, IT, IS, EE, CpE, Math) and 24% from non-STEM majors (e.g. Law, Graphics Design, Theater, International Studies, Business). The applicant pool also consisted of 71% male / 29% female and 24% of applicants were in underrepresented ethnic groups.&nbsp; A local partner school program supported by CFITS has allowed recruitment of students through K-12 STEM outreach activities that have reached over 10,000 students since inception of the program.</p>\n<p>Cyber Scholar students focus on cybersecurity research during their programs.

SFS students also actively participated in the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC), National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NCCDC), and the Cyber 9/12 challenge.
