 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are  provided for the principal investigators (PIs) to participate in a project that aims to investigate the dynamics controlling fault continuity, strain partitioning, and interaction between multiple fault branches as fault systems evolve. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the evolving relationship between the northern and central branches of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). To evaluate a series of possible models describing this relationship, the project will use high-resolution multi-channel seismic (MCS) data already collected for the northern branch, and will collect new MCS data for the central branch. The data will be combined with modeling to characterize slip history, strain partitioning, and relative fault activity. Results will constrain the evolution of the NAF system and enable comparisons with other transform fault systems. Funds will allow the initial participation of the PIs on the Turkish reserach cruise.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work has direct implications for understanding seismic hazards in Turkey, and may also support a future IODP initiative in the area. It will strengthen international ties through ongoing collaboration with Turkish researchers. The PIs will continue ongoing outreach efforts. Data management includes archiving of data in various repositories within two years of acquisition/analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is a joint Turkish-American project funded by TUBITAK and NSF, respectively.  The North Anatolian Fault is a major strike-slip fault in Turkey that has experienced numerous damaging earthquakes over the centuries.  The latest were the 1999 Izmit (Mw 7.6) and Duzce (Mw 7.2) earthquakes.  As the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) approaches the Marmara Sea and Istanbul it splinters into several branches.  Most of the motion continues along the northern branch, which has been extensively studied.  The project mounted two cruises to image the layers of sediment and faulting and sediment layers along the little studied central branch in the southern Marmara Sea. We participated in the first cruise.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWe found clear evidence of active faulting on many individual strands of the central branch of the NAF.  We have also been able to extend our correlation of sediment layers into the southern Marmara Sea, providing some control on the relative age of the sedimentary strata.  The faults offsetting the layers of correlated strata indicate that the faulting rate and pattern has remained unchanged for several hundred thousand years.  These results contradict recent model that suggest the central branch is waning and fault motion is focusing on the northern branch, which passes next to Istanbul. \n\nWe also undertook preliminary fieldwork along the southern coast of the Marmara Sea.  We found evidence that the deformed rocks from an earlier collision event have been reused during the formation of the Marmara Sea.  These reused faults continue offshore and tie to a low-angle fault, or detachment, previously identified by other projects.  Furthermore, we imaged active high-angle faults that likely end in the detachment.  This suggests that this older fault system was reused during the Marmara Sea basin formation.  The presence of weak older faults that can be reused may help explain why multiple faults of the NAF at the Marmara Sea are still active and the faulting has not simplified to a single major fault in this region.\n\nBroader Impacts.\n\nIstanbul is considered one of the megacities of the world that is most at risk for a damaging earthquake.  How the motion along the NAF is distributed among multiple faults has important consequences for estimating the seismic hazard for Istanbul and the broader Marmara Sea region.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael S Steckler"
