 "awd_abstract_narration": "HOV Alvin has undergone a major overhaul and upgrade, and has been out of service since December, 2010.  The upgrades include: a larger personnel sphere with two additional viewports, which will be capable of diving to 6500m water depth; improved lighting and imaging capability; improved command and control systems; and, an increased science payload capacity.  The vehicle is undergoing reinstatement of certification by the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).  Following certification, it will be important for the science community to understand what the changes to the vehicle mean in terms of science support capability, especially bottom time, integration with external sensors and equipment, speed over ground, agility of manipulators, video quality, etc.\r\nThis award provides funding for a Science Verification Cruise.  A team of experience Alvin users will validate the present capabilities of the vehicle in a 10-12 dive program, after which a report will be made available to future Alvin users.  \r\n\r\nPlanned dive assessments include:\r\n* Direct observations of the deep ocean and seafloor to depths of up to 4500 m;\r\n* HD still and video imaging/documentation of observations;\r\n* Systematic mapping/surveys of seabed and overlying water column (with appropriate sensors);\r\n* Collection of materials and biomass at the seafloor and in the overlying water column (with appropriate samplers);\r\n* Placement/recovery of instruments and landers at the seafloor;\r\n* Efficient Transit time that is scientifically useful between work sites;\r\n* Systematic exploration of regions/habitats/organisms.\r\n\r\nTargets dives include: San Diego Trough; Del Mar Methane Seep; OMZ bottom; La Jolla Canyon; Santa Monica Fossil seep; Santa Monica Mounds North; and, Putative hydrothermal venting (Palos Verdes).  Personnel transfers are planned during the cruise in order to accommodate as many diverse participants as possible.",

It has played a role in the discovery of hydrothermal vents (underwater hot springs that harbor tremendous communities of unique animals and microbes), the discovery of numerous sunken vessels including the RMS Titanic, and was one of the first deep sea vehicles to respond to the Deepwater Horizon accident.  \n\nAround the turn of the century, scientists began seriously discussing an Alvin upgrade, in which they proposed to update the vehicle with state-of-the-art sensors and cameras, as well as advanced power and propulsion systems.  Subsequently, the National Science Foundation in partnership with other federal agencies approved a program to upgrade the HOV Alvin with the aforementioned technologies.  In addition, the vehicle was updated with new flotation foam and pressure housings that would allow the submersible to dive to 6500 meters (pending additional upgrades).\n\nOver the past five years, HOV Alvin has undergone a suite of enhancements including a new pressure hull with improved visibility and ergonomics, new digital imaging and data acquisition systems, a novel basket that accommodates greater payloads, and numerous improvements to the vehicle\u00c6s command and control systems. The new pressure sphere has been certified to 6500m. Future upgrades to the submarine\u00c6s batteries and other major subsystems will ultimately make this HOV capable of operations at 6500 m.\n\nCompletion of Navy sea trials occurred in late 2013, and resulted in Alvin being re-certified for operations.  However, there are key aspects of vehicle operation and performance that are critical to science but not necessarily included in the certification process as defined by the US Navy\u00c6s protocols. \n\nConsequently, we requested support for a science verification cruise (SVC) that will be conducted to assess the research capabilities of the vehicle.  The specific objectives of the cruise will include:  1) involvement of experienced users to ensure operational components and scientific sensors on the vehicle are working properly, 2) pursuit of various science projects and opportunistic exploration, and 3) education of select early career scientists who intend to write proposals for deep submergence field science using HOV Alvin in the coming months. \n\nProject outcomes: The Science Verification cruise took place on March 13-25, 2105.

Observers also commented on the spectacular field of view that one has when they sit up close to the viewport.\n\nWith respect to the scientific payload, the upgraded Alvin basket is larger than the previous version,  allowing for the potential to carry more scientific equipment on an individual dive.  Like the previous version, the basket is fully adaptable, and the gear can be mounted in multiple configurations. As there is always a demand for space on the basket, the new basket provides an upgrade to the previous configuration.\n\nDespite its greater weight and s..."
