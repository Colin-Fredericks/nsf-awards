 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across South and Southeast Asia, aquifers along rivers draining the Himalayas are heavily utilized for dry-season irrigation and domestic water supply.  Previous work has documented elevated arsenic (As) concentrations in the deltaic aquifers of these rivers, including the Ganges-Brahmaputra, the Red, and the Mekong.   Few studies have been conducted in the alluvial aquifers upgradient of the deltaic aquifers, but those few have documented locally elevated As concentrations.  The monsoonal climate of the region imposes shifts in hydraulic gradients between the river and adjacent aquifers.  These gradient shifts have the potential to influence the behavior of trace elements in groundwater due to changes in flow magnitude and direction, as well as in redox conditions.   \r\nThis project initiates an international collaboration with investigators at Khon Kaen University, Thailand to collect preliminary hydrologic and geochemical data from an alluvial aquifer along the Mekong River in northeast Thailand. Wells and the river will be sampled during the dry season (November) and the monsoon season (May-June) and samples analyzed for field parameters, major ions, selected trace elements, dissolved organic carbon and stable isotopes.  Equipment will be installed  in selected wells for continuous monitoring. This data will enable tracking of  flow between the alluvial aquifer and the Mekong.  The group  will develop a conceptual model of alluvial aquifer-river interactions, which will form the basis of a proposal to the NSF Hydrologic Sciences program for a longer-term and more spatially intensive study.  Results will be shared with local residents, educators and government agencies in Thailand, and with researchers through CUAHSI?s Hydrologic Information Systems (HIS), and  will provide a baseline for the aquifer prior to dam construction projects proposed on the Mekong. The  conceptual model will offer a template for other alluvial aquifers in the region, such as the Irrawaddy valley of Myanmar, where dams are being built or planned. \r\n\r\nNon-technical abstract:\r\nElevated arsenic (As) in groundwater across South and Southeast Asia is a critical public health problem. The behavior of As and other trace elements in groundwater is tied to hydrologic and geochemical processes, which are in turn influenced by climate.  Another possible forcing is the construction of dams, which dramatically changes the connections between the river and the adjacent aquifers. Our goal is to collect a preliminary dataset on the geochemistry of groundwater in an aquifer adjacent to the Mekong River in northeast Thailand during two hydrologic seasons: the dry season (November) and the monsoon season (May-June).   The results will be used to develop a conceptual model of how climate influences aquifer-river interactions, and if those interactions affect As concentrations in the aquifer.  These data will provide a ?baseline? of water quality in the aquifer prior to construction of proposed dams on the Lower Mekong.",

The behavior of As and other elements in groundwater is linked to hydrologic and geochemical processes, which are in turn influenced by climate. However, these linkages are complicated and not completely understood. We worked with Thai colleagues to study groundwater chemistry and flow beneath the floodplain of the Mekong River at two sites in northeast Thailand. We collected water samples for chemical analyses during the dry season (January) and the early monsoon season (June) of 2014. We also installed instruments to monitor water levels and salinity in wells from January 2014 to March 2015. Arsenic concentrations varied locally, but values exceeded the recommended drinking-water standard in multiple wells at both sites, with the maximum concentration more than 10 times the recommended value. Most samples with elevated As also had elevated iron, which is consistent with studies elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia. Water levels in wells varied with the level of the Mekong River. Groundwater flows toward the river during most of the year, but away from the river as it rises during the early monsoon season. Brackish (moderately saline) groundwater occurs at relatively shallow depth beneath the floodplain, but that depth fluctuates seasonally with river level. Our results indicate that both As concentrations and salinity need to be considered when planning groundwater use along the Mekong River in the region. In addition, changes in river levels as a result of climate change or installation of dams are likely to affect water chemistry in floodplain aquifers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/01/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Fryar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1338213/1338213_10272122_1427942302340_P1090211--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1338213/1338213_10272122_1427942302340_P1090211--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"That Phanom nest 3, January 2014\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1338213/1338213_10272122_1427942302340_P1090211--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"That Phanom nest 3, January 2014\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pumping monitoring well with jet pump at That Phanom, Thailand.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alan Fryar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Fryar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">That Phanom nest 3, January 2014</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
