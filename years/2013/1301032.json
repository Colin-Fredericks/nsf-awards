 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award CHE-1301032 provided by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism-B Program (CSDM-B) and the Chemistry of Life Processes of the National Science Foundation to Professor Michael T. Bowers at the University of California at Santa Barbara will be used to investigate the mechanism of peptide assembly.  This is currently a very active area of research both for its fundamental importance and because of possible therapeutic applications in neurological diseases.  These studies will include the determination of oligomer distributions, the structures of sized selected oligomers and the effect of select inhibitors on this process.  Peptides will be selected to test existing models for beta sheet formation and eventual fibrilization and for their possible implications in amyloid based diseases.  Experimental methods will include ion mobility spectrometry coupled with mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron spectroscopy and a newly developed oligomer size selected infrared spectroscopy experiment constructed at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, Germany.  The experiments will be complimented by high level theoretical calculations including both DFT and replica exchange molecular dynamics.  Inhibitors will include both naturally occurring substances like polyphenols and specially synthesized molecules designed for select peptide attachment. \r\n\r\nThe two fastest growing major diseases in the US today are Alzheimer's disease and Type 2 Diabetes.  These seemingly dissimilar diseases share the common trait of having toxic agents that come from the assembly of ordinarily innocuous agents (peptides) in the body:  one process occurring in the brain causing Alzheimer's disease and the other in the pancreas causing Type 2 Diabetes.  It isn't clear how these normally safe species assemble into deadly ones nor is it clear how they kill cells once they do assemble.  This is a difficult problem to study with the normal tools of biochemistry that can't select specific assembled peptides and hence can't tell their structure or how toxic they are.  The thrust of this proposal is to provide a new set of methods that can do this selecting and to apply these methods to model peptide systems to learn the factors that control peptide assembly in general and then test simple molecules that can stop this assembly in its tracks.  Finally the results are translated into presentations that can be given to local high schools and each Bowers group member visits several such schools each year to make these presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn biology most important information is transmitted via non-covalent interaction between two or more entities.  Most often one of those entities is a peptide or protein whose tertiary structure needs to be in either a native or a specific activated state for the transfer to be successful.  A second, and related phenomenon in biology, is the near ubiqutious presense of oligomeric or fibrilic forms of peptides or proteins for many devastating diseases. These so called amyloid diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Type 2 Diabetes for example) are intimately linked to the assembly of over expressed or under cleared protein with the toxic agent more often than not found early on in the assembly process (i.e. an early oligomer state).  The current paradigm views the assembly occuring from native like monomer protein that samples different structures as it forms oligomers (for example dimers, teramers hexamers) some of which are metastabe (long lived) and simultaneously cytotoxic.  This is a serious condition found in the etiology of most amyloid diseases to date. \n\nIn the work funded by this NSF grant ( and by its predicessor grant and its succesor grant) we have begun to determine the mechanisms and structures involved in model systems that connect to real bilogical systems.  We have developed unique technology based on ion mobility methods that allow us to determine the accurate 3-dimensional tertiary structure of assembling systems one oligomer at a time.  We have now begun active collaborations with colleagues that allow us to put these soluble oligomers, detcted and characterized by ion mobility, in context to the larger fibrular evolution problem and to understand the intricate secondary structural development of the olligomers as they assemble.  The first collaboration involves Atomic Force Microscopy that allows us to do time line measurements of structural evolution up to and including formation of fibrils.  The second collaboration involves the combination of ion mobility with infrared spectroscopy that allows us to determine details of the internal structure of each individual oligomer (helix, beta sheet, coil).  Our goal is to understand these assebly processes at a fundamental level and then use this knowledge to contribute to therapeutic development for cure of disease.  The work has been and contiues to be well recieved by our scientific colleagues as judged by the success of our publications in the best peer reviewed journals (23 for the 4 year life of this grant).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael T Bowers"
