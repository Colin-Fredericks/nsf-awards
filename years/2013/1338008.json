UTB is a minority-serving institution in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) of Texas. With a population of 1.5 million, comprised primarily of Hispanics, the RGV is the fourth-largest populated region in the state. The project supports four specific research components: (i) Integration of Microcantilever with AC Electrokinetics for Sensing Bio-/Nano-Particles. tric fields for the implementation of high-efficiency bioparticle collection and separation. (ii) Biased AC Electroosmosis Micropump for Water Management in PEM Fuel Cells. (iii) Biomimetic Flow Sensing. The main objective of this activity is to obtain the micro-scale time-dependent flow structures. (iv) Selective Filtration/Absorption of Nano- and Micron- Size Particles Using Carbon Nanotube-Based Media. This activity will synthesize carbon nanotube-based media with various morphologies and densities to  selectively filter nano- and micron-size particles from fluid flow.",
