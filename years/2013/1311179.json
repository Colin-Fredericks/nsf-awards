 "awd_abstract_narration": "The volume and variability of water flowing through rivers and streams are primary regulators of freshwater biodiversity, particularly for fishes.  This regulation is partially due to energetic constraints imposed by particular flow conditions.  For example, some species are better adapted to fast currents for food resource acquisition, while others require slower currents.  In addition to energetic constraints, species are also influenced by biological interactions such as predation and competition with ecologically similar species.  Consequently, fish populations will persist given suitable amounts of food resources and reasonable levels of interactions with other species, two factors which are also regulated by flow conditions.  Nevertheless, the combined effects of flow characteristics and biological interactions in determining fish species diversity are not well understood.  This project addresses this issue by collecting food web data from multiple sites in the Meramec River system in southeastern Missouri and relating these measurements to stream flow characteristics.  Investigating factors influencing food web structure in the context of various flow regimes will provide novel information on the primary factors regulating biodiversity in freshwater stream ecosystems.\r\n  \r\nThe Meramec River watershed is located in the Ozark Highlands and represents a freshwater biodiversity hotspot in North America.  Over 120 species of fishes are found in the Meramec River and its tributaries.  At the same time, the Meramec River supplies drinking water to approximately 250,000 people.  Although the drainage area remains relatively pristine, some stream sections are experiencing ongoing degradation due to human modifications of the landscape.  Consequently, the Meramec River watershed is a primary focus of collaborative conservation efforts by the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy due to its biological importance and the dependence of humans on the water resources in the drainage.  Results from this research will be of practical use for these conservation agencies during their attempts to balance human activities and the conservation of biodiversity in this unique aquatic ecosystem.  In addition, several undergraduate students will be trained in research techniques as well as exposed to issues focused on the conservation of aquatic resources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the relationships between stream flow and the number and kinds of species in aquatic systems is of considerable importance considering the economic and recreational benefits of freshwater species as well as the ongoing impacts of human activities on freshwater habitats.  In this project, we addressed two main questions regarding how freshwater biodiversity and interactions among species are influenced by stream flow patterns.  The first question addressed whether the number and kinds of fishes and invertebrates at a location are associated with variation in stream flow patterns across a watershed, and can these measures be better explained by also considering the amount of food resources available at a site.  The second question addressed whether interactions between species at a location (for example, predators and prey) varies across sites in a watershed and are these differences associated with variation in stream flow patterns. \n\nAll the proposed field data collection and laboratory work was completed during the funding period and the results have allowed us to adress the main research questions.  At the watershed scale, stream flow patterns and food availability are both important for predicting differences in the number and kinds of fish and macroinvertebrates among sites.  Feeding relationships among species (termed trophic interactions) were quantified based on food web characteristics at a site, the sources of nutrients that were used by stream organisms were also determined, as well as the rate that fish species consumed food resources.  These different aspects of trophic interactions were strongly influenced by stream flow characteristics, food availability, and fish population characteristics.  The results demonstrated that the association between stream flow and aquatic species does not take place through physical forces and habitat characterstics alone, but in concert with biological processes related to resource and energy acquisition.  Therefore, biological interactions associated with differences in flow should be taken into account during the management and conservation of freshwater biodiversity.   \n\nThe data and results generated from this study are providing important information of practical use by conservation agencies, including the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy, during their attempts to balance human activities and the conservation of biodiversity in local freshwater systems in the Meramec River watershed.  Dr. Knouft and Dr. Niu have co-mentored three undergraduate students, Mr. Sam Vohsen, Ms. Summer Issa, and Mr. Seth Weixlmann, who participated in field and laboratory work on this project during the fall of 2011 and summer of 2014.  All the results have been published in Dr. Niu\u00c6s PhD dissertation, and Dr. Knouft and Dr. Niu are currently preparing manuscripts based on the four dissertation chapters.  The manuscripts will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals by the end of 2015.  The fish and macroinvertebrate specimens from this research are maintained in the Knouft lab at Saint Louis University for teaching and research purposes.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason H Knouft"
