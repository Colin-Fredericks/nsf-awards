The intellectual merit of this activity rests in open exchange of the latest research results concerning formation, physical and chemical properties, transformation and cloud-climate impacts of atmospheric aerosol particles. Broader impacts of this support center on offering a unique opportunity for student scientists to share research results and have discussions with an international cross-section of established experts in their respective subdisciplines.",
