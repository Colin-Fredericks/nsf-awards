 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will advance the development of a new pulmonary testing instrument.  The innovative device utilizes a strain gauge to measure pulmonary airflow, an indicator critical in monitoring the health of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.  The research challenge is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a customized strain gauge for this device.  This will involve fabricating and testing thin film sensors and comparing their efficacy to the commercial sensor now used.  The customized sensors will be developed in a university-based clean room and tested against the commercial sensors by comparing signal to noise measurements.  Research efforts will aim at improving signal to noise and minimizing non-linear responses seen in the commercial sensor.  For this proposal, the specific application of the new sensor will be in a device that will measure pulmonary airflow resistance using the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT).  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to market an instrument that has significant advantages over those currently in use to measure lung airflow of pulmonary disease patients.  An estimated 36.4 million Americans suffer from asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Successful development of the proposed assistive technology will offer a low-cost, easily cleaned, readily mobile testing device that is adaptable to home use.  The specific application proposed for this device, forced oscillation technique (FOT), has a significant advantage over standard spirometry, as it does not depend upon deliberate cooperation of the patient to perform required respiratory maneuvers.  It is therefore useful for comatose patients, infants and children, mentally and physically impaired individuals, and even animals.  FOT devices are new developments; they are being used primarily in research settings.  The device proposed here will be extremely competitive in the marketplace, primarily due to its low cost, but also to its simple design and ease of use.  Software developed for his device will make the wireless transfer of data from the patient?s home to the physician?s office effortless.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project enabled Feather Sensors, LLC to fabricate and test a custom piezoresistive thin film sensor for use in its innovative pulmonary Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) device, the FeatherTone FOT Lung Analyzer.  The device measures pulmonary airway impedance, an indicator critical in monitoring the health of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.  The research involved fabricating and testing thin film sensors and comparing their efficacy to the commercial strain gauge used in earlier prototypes.  It further entailed comparing the FeatherTone FOT Lung Analyzer incorporating this new sensor with a standard FOT instrument that incorporates a pneumotach.  The pneumotach is the gold standard apparatus for respiratory measurement and is used in most spirometers and FOT instruments. \n\nPhase I of this project successfully developed a highly sensitive thin film sensor that significantly outperforms the commercial sensor used in prototype devices.  Outcomes included successful development and testing of sensors with different metals, designs, and circuits.  The FOT Lung Analyzer incorporating the optimal sensor was tested by comparing its measurements with those from a pneumotach-based FOT device.  The custom sensor achieved equal if not better electrical responses to oscillatory airflow than the pneumotach.  The grantee is thus able to replace pneumotach-based devices with an accurate device that is less complicated in design, with simpler electronics, easier to clean and maintain, and much less costly. \n\nFeather Sensors believes that this NSF supported study establishes the feasibility of using thin film sensors for medical FOT analysis. The sensing element is completely compatible for this medical application and, with further refinement described in the Phase II application, Feather Sensors intends to commercialize its custom sensors in the FeatherTone FOT Lung Analyzer.\n\nBroader Impacts/Commercial Potentials\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is found in the FeatherTone FOT Lung Analyzer, an instrument that has significant advantages over those currently used to measure lung airflow of pulmonary disease patients.  An estimated 40.8 million Americans suffer from asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Successful development of the proposed assistive technology will offer a low-cost, easily cleaned, readily mobile testing device that is adaptable to home use.

The marketplace is searching for alternatives to traditional means of monitoring health.  Many entrants are offering variations of FOT that use pneumotachs.  The Feather Sensors approach is entirely new and has significant benefits over these other devices. The Company is seeking investors and partners and believes that once the device has received FDA PMA approval, additional private support will be readily forthcoming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSu..."
