 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Orion Berryman from the University of Montana and colleagues Tom Livingstone, Robert Szilagyi, Edward Rosenberg and Charles Thompson will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of organocatalysts with halogen bonding; (b) solid-state structures of luminescent ruthenium diimine complexes; (c) development of molecular yardsticks to determine the spatial dimensions and key binding motifs of glutamate transporter proteins; (d) asymmetric catalysis of Group 3 metals and cationic cyclizations; (e) development of structure activity relationships for isoxazole containing drug candidates; and (f) electronic and geometric structures of metalloenzymatic and organometallic catalysts.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training and will contribute to educate students both at the University of Montana and Montana State University including those from a Native American background as well as high school students and those at a tribal college.",

This is a state-of-the-art instrument that analyzes crystalline samples and provides an atomic picture of the compound. The instrument was installed at the University of Montana in February 2014. This is the only instrument of this type in the Rocky Mountain Northwest and has enabled chemical analysis for nine labs across five different universities. Data for over 900 samples have been collected by the facility leading to over 26 publications and new discoveries. One significant discovery enabled by this instrument includes the first solid state characterization of an iodide induced self-assembled triple helix. This self-assembly process could lead to a general and efficient strategy to create complicated structures. These structures could find use as sensors to detect environmental contaminants and as synthetic anion channels to treat diseases associated with anion misregulation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Numerous outreach activities were also enhanced by this instrument. Individuals attended three international workshops to be trained to analyze data on the instrument. Additionally three crystallography workshops were provided on the purchased instrument for scientists across the region. Two laboratory classes incorporated the instrument in their learning objectives. Reaching a broad audience, this instrument played a central role in the research projects of an REU student from Blackfeet Community College and an ACS SEED student. Both students were studying how molecules assemble in the solid state. This form of crystal engineering can be used to control a vast range materials properties ranging from enhanced catalysts to improved organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Finally, this research was used to inspire children to study STEM. Three chemistry summer camps were enhanced to include crystallography and X-ray diffraction.
