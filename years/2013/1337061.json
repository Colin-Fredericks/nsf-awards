The core-shell nanoparticles will provide a structure where the magnetic core responds to permanent magnetic or alternating radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields, and the gold shell responds photonically to ultraviolet-visible or near infrared (NIR) light. RF and NIR absorbance will be examined as a function of core-shell structure, including spherical and tubular geometries. By exploiting the ability of the core-shell nanoparticles to convert the absorbed field energy into heat, controlled release from liposome-templated nanoparticles using dual NIR and RF triggers will be examined. This approach represents an original strategy and the project is expected to lead to transformative advances in the way multifunctional nanoparticles are synthesized and the way nanoparticles respond and react to simultaneous NIR and RF fields.\r\n\r\nRises in the spread and severity of chronic diseases coupled with the need for selective, non-invasive treatments have created a demand for more effective therapies. In addition to being economical and having long-term chemical and physical stability, the ideal therapeutic system would be multifunctional providing disease targeting, imaging, diagnostic, and drug delivery capabilities. Magnetic-gold core-shell nanoparticles represent such a system where multiple therapeutic objectives can be realized. Students will impacted by this work through direct training, curriculum development, and STEM outreach.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Particulate and Multiphase Processes and Thermal Transport Processing Programs in Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport Division in Engineering Directorate.",
