 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social behavior is a critical target for natural selection because expressing behaviors appropriate for a given social context affects reproduction, resource acquisition, and survival.  Social context can vary greatly over a lifetime, however, and it remains unknown how well, and by what means, individuals can deal with this variation.  The bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli), a highly social fish, is a useful model for investigating context-specific social interactions because behavior and reproduction are simple to measure, and social context is easy to alter in relevant ways.  Hormones such as androgens, which are important for vertebrate social behavior, reproduction, and context-specificity, can also be measured and manipulated in L. dalli.  For each status class in a hierarchy of gobies, there are specific social behaviors that promote group reproduction.  This work will test for the first time whether those successful individuals can translate prior success into positive outcomes in different social contexts and whether the strategic expression of distinct behavioral patterns underlies that success.  The reproductive success of individual L. dalli may be directly regulated by androgens and/or regulation could be indirect via androgen effects on important social behaviors.  Androgens acting in the brain may be particularly important for the regulation of L. dalli behaviors associated with reproduction.  This work could elucidate an evolutionarily conserved interaction between androgens and reproductive success.  Social behavior is complex, and this research approach, which integrates an evolutionary perspective with mechanistic regulation by hormones, will be critical to understanding why and how individuals behave the way that they do.  Diverse undergraduates, including women and minorities underrepresented in science, have been, and will continue to be, involved in all stages of this research.  This work has already been shared with the public at K-12 schools, museums, and research centers, and these education efforts will continue to be a priority.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis funding by NSF provided the opportunity to investigate the interactions among social behavior, hormones, and reproduction in the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli), a highly socially fish that undergoes socially-regulated, bidirectional sex change. \n\nIn stable social groups, we found that patterns of social interaction are closely tied to fitness: males have lower reproductive success in social groups with higher rates of social interaction and aggression.  In particular, aggression among females, especially targeting the middle-ranking female, was associated with differences in male reproductive success.  Although the male is socially dominant and can disrupt aggressive interactions between females, some males are capable of maintaining low aggression social groups and some are not.  These differences in male leadership style, therefore, have important consequences for his fitness.  Sex and stress hormone levels were also associated with the social and reproductive dynamics of the social group.  This work also involved developing a novel yet simple method of dying eggs within the ovary using injections of food coloring.  Injected females lay colored eggs, allowing for the identification of the female that laid the eggs.  This technique will be broadly useful to ichthyologists and herpetologists. \n\nTo better understand how an individual\u00c6s behavior affects their group members, we systematically formed social groups with fish of known aggression levels.  Aggressive fish of different social statuses should have unique consequences for their group.  We also used pharmacological manipulations to link specific neurochemicals to social behaviors important for reproduction.  Manipulation of arginine vasotocin signaling in the brains of dominant females had behavioral affects not only on her social behavior, but also on the behavior of other group members.  This demonstrates the ways in which social behavior in a group is highly interconnected. \n\nSocial behavior can cause differences in reproduction and reproduction can cause differences in behavior.  To determine the direction of causation in goby social groups, we primed females to make different reproductive decisions.  Groups with females in different reproductive states had different patterns of social interaction.  When the middle-ranking female was ready to lay eggs (gravid), males initiated more interactions with that female.  Additionally, males occupied a more central position and the gravid female occupied a less central position within the social network.  This effect was status specific.  When the highest-ranking female was gravid, there were no differences in behavior or social network dynamics.  This suggests that the shift in male behavior is tactical and may help the subordinate female get reproductive opportunities.  Whether or not a female actually laid eggs, which was associated with changes in stress hormone levels, did not affect the social network dynamics.         \n\nFinally, our work demonstrated that social behavior and social status not only have a profound effect on bluebanded goby adults, but also during early-life.  We showed for the first time that juveniles, which develop with both ovarian and testicular tissue in their gonads, become either males or females based on their early-life social status.  Dominant juveniles grew at faster rates and developed as male.  Subordinates developed as female.  This is the same mechanism of sex determination as for adults, suggesting that the same mechanism can both create and maintain female-biased sex ratios in populations of bluebanded gobies.  There was substantial variation in the kinds of social groups in which juveniles developed in nature.  Most juveniles were subordinate and developed as female, but a small proportion did develop initially as male.  Early-life social status did not appear to limit whether an individual can appropriately express dominant or subordinate social behaviors in the future. \n\nIn ..."
