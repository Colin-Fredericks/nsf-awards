 "awd_abstract_narration": "As software pervades our society and lives, failures due to software\r\nbugs become increasingly costly.  Scalable approaches for\r\nsystematically checking software to find crucial bugs hold a key to\r\ndelivering higher quality software at a lower cost.  Mera is a\r\nmethodology to scale model checking and symbolic execution which are two\r\npowerful approaches for systematic software analysis and known to be\r\ncomputationally expensive.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on two novel concepts: memoization, which allows\r\nre-using computations performed across different checks to amortize\r\nthe cost of software analysis; and ranging, which allows distributing\r\nthe analysis into sub-problems of lesser complexity, which can be\r\nsolved separately and efficiently.  Mera consists of three research\r\nthrusts.  First, the core memoization and ranging techniques for model\r\nchecking and symbolic execution are developed.  Second, these\r\ntechniques are optimized in the context of different kinds of changes,\r\nlike the program code, expected properties, or analysis search-depth\r\nparameters.  Third, these techniques are adapted to effectively\r\nutilize available resources for parallel computation using static and\r\ndynamic strategies, such as work stealing.  Mera will help improve\r\nsoftware quality and reliability thus holding the potential to provide\r\nsubstantial economic benefits and to improve our quality of life.",
