They attended technical sessions, plenary sessions, keynote addresses, short courses, field trips, and social events, to network with others in their discipline and in allied disciplines, encompassing a growing field called medical geology. \n\n \n\nA special feature of the conference was the availability of student travel grants providing partial support to attend MEDGEO 2013.  Students had the opportunity to present their research results and to \"rub shoulders\" with experienced professionals in medical geology.  Dr. Alan Jacobs, a member of the Executive Committee of MEDGEO 2013, and professor of geology and environmental science at Youngstown State University (Ohio), applied to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund some of the student travel awards for MEDGEO 2013, and was awarded $18,000 (approximately $1,000 each for 18 graduate and post-doctoral students).  The winning students had to have their submitted abstracts accepted by a conference review committee, had to be the first author and presenter, had to be in full-time attendance at a U.S. university, and had to state their need for travel funds.  Eighteen NSF funded travel stipends were awarded for a total of $17,983.47.  Students represented 8 U.S. universities, presenting their research on such topics as water quality on native American reservations, contamination of urban soils, the use of natural clay and other minerals as antibacterial media, and lung damage in U.S. soldiers returning from the Middle East who were exposed to inhaled metallic dust.\n\n \n\nThe outcome of this grant not only allowed students to learn from professional conference presenters, but as seen from the presentation of student research, educated the professionals in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan M Jacobs"
