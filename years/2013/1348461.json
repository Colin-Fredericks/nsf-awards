 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although many virtual organizations (VO) are quite effective, not all VO practitioners are effective in each area, and there is no organized body of knowledge or set of ?best practices? among VOs to draw upon for key issues. Therefore centers are likely not as effective as they could be. This proposal involves the creation of an online knowledge exchange.  This Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) would provide leaders of virtual organizations with resources about running virtual organizations and access to relevant organizational scientists. VORTEX is intended to aid in building a community among virtual organization leaders so that they can collaborate, share, and learn with and from each other. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives of the work include development, evaluation, and improvement of an online Virtual Organization Resources and Toolkits Exchange (VORTEX) environment to aid scientists and engineers to more effectively lead virtual organizations. This type of environment is necessary in order to: \r\n(1) Connect leaders of virtual organizations with appropriate organization scientists; \r\n(2) Provide online educational and reference materials for issues associated with managing virtual organizations; and\r\n(3) Establish a center for leaders of virtual organization to share and collaborate with each other.\r\n",

Further, this includes an incredibly involved (and unforeseen) level of work relating this research to the existing research in non-virtual organizations.

From these we have four dimensions that we refer to as virtual work teams, agent relationships, managed crowds, and open projects.

The end goal will involve generating new theory into the coordination of virtual work and the role of technical platforms as coordination mechanisms, as well as additional practitioner guidance based on the literature.\n\nFrom this research, we have also dug more deeply into platform-centered coordination and how to get both participation and knowledge sharing through platforms.  This is very important for the practice of virtual organizations because, as we move increasingly to virtual coordination, the active engaged participation and in-depth knowledge-based collaboration is increasingly relevant. We are using meta-analyses of online communities for participation and knowledge sharing to gain insight into this issue.  Primary drivers of participation involve identification, commitment, and engagement with a community, and the primary driver of knowledge sharing in an online community is participation, of course, but also social ties and group identification with a community.  Clearly this notion of identification is critical to both participation and knowledge sharing and the meta-analysis unpacks this theoretical relationship.\n\nThe UGA team is also continuing to work closely with the UT Austin linked project in creating content for the website*.
