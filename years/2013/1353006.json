Instead of having one large chip connected to a dense electrode array via a cable, many tiny low-cost chips that form a complete system are distributed over a foldable substrate. Specified regions of the substrate willt be arranged to establish relations in the final folded form. New patterns will be developed that can be tiled into pixel arrays and provide 3D positioning of the components mounted upon the substrate. The reconfigurable chips will have novel proximity sensors and communication circuits to form a complete system suitable for the origami structure and deployment. Micromechanical latches will be used for fixation and tuning of the structure. Different module \"types\" will be developed that can be elegantly tiled into arrays and result in 3D shapes that match the contour of the tissue. The reconfigurable chips will have novel proximity sensors,  communication and power delivery circuits to form a complete system with the proposed modular structure.",
