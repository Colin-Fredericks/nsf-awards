 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the response of lower stratospheric and surface climate to the changes in insolation accompanying the 11-year sunspot cycle.  Insolation changes are hypothesized to affect stratospheric temperature as increases in solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation cause increases in stratospheric ozone which in turn lead to increases in stratospheric temperature (maximizing over the tropics) and midlatitude zonal winds.  The increased stratospheric zonal winds then affect circulation at lower levels through the wave-mean flow interactions associated with the \"downward control\" mechanism, producing a pattern of sea level pressure anomalies including low pressure over the poles and high pressure over the northern North Pacific.  Work conducted under this award would examine this \"top down\" mechanism for the influence of solar variability on surface climate in simulations from two climate models, one in which the solar-induced ozone anomalies are specified from satellite observations, and another (the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, or WACCM) in which the ozone changes are generated internally by the model in response to the insolation change.  In the WACCM simulations, the insolation change will be prescribed according to several estimates of its spectral distribution, to determine the sensitivity of the response to uncertainty in the UV component of the 11-year solar forcing.  WACCM simulations will also be used explore the sensitivity of the response to additional factors including the phase of the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation.\r\n\r\nThe work will have broader impacts through the support and training of a graduate student, which will develop the scientific workforce in this scientific area. In addition, a better understanding of the impact of solar variability on climate may prove useful for understanding the sensitivity of climate to external forcing, and the mechanisms which determine the climatic response.  Such information may benefit decision makers engaged in policy decisions regarding climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work done under this 2-year grant has taken several positive steps toward identifying characteristics of climate models that are necessary for accurately simulating the component of climate change that is caused by solar variability.  There are two primary mechanisms that can lead to solar-induced climate change.  The first, termed \"bottom-up forcing\", involves changes in solar radiative output at visible and longer wavelengths that penetrate directly to the surface.  The second, termed \"top-down forcing\", involves mainly variations in solar radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths, which produce changes in ozone and radiative heating in the stratosphere.  The latter changes can modify atmospheric circulation at lower levels, producing detectable changes in regional climate. \n\nThe most important work done under this grant has involved statistical analyses of simulations performed using six advanced climate models that include all essential elements for operation of both the bottom-up and top-down mechanisms (a well-resolved stratosphere, interactive ozone chemistry, and a coupled ocean).  A consistent statistical method (multiple linear regression) was applied to both model data and available stratospheric observations during the 1979-2005 period to evaluate whether the models were able to simulate the observed stratospheric response to the 11-year solar cycle.  All of the six models (four developed in the U.S. and two in Japan) were forced using a conservative model for temporal changes in solar radiation that was developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory based on proxy measurements such as sunspot and plage areas on the solar disk.  The latter solar radiation model differs from that estimated using recent satellite measurements, which suggest much larger variability at UV wavelengths.  However, the satellite measurements may have been affected by instrument-related drifts and so are not yet validated.  It was found that three of the models (one developed in the U.S.  and two in Japan) produce solar-induced signals of ozone, temperature, and westerly wind in the stratosphere that are in reasonable agreement with observational evidence, especially when uncertainties in the observations are considered.  The remaining three models did not for reasons that can be understood in terms of differences or deficiencies in their radiation and chemistry codes.  These results therefore implied that at least some fully coupled climate models are able to simulate the observed stratospheric response to 11-year solar forcing even if a conservative solar radiation model is adopted.  This is important because (a) it supports use of the proxy-based models of solar UV radiation in climate models; and (b) accurate simulation of the stratospheric response is a prerequisite for simulating the top-down component of solar-induced climate change.\n\nFurther analysis of the three models that produced a realistic stratospheric response to 11-year solar UV forcing yielded several other implications for climate models.  Analyses of global satellite-based data have previously indicated that both ozone and temperature exhibit a secondary response in the tropical lower stratosphere in addition to the primary response in the upper stratosphere that is known to be caused by direct photochemical increases in ozone production rate and radiative heating.  The lower stratospheric response is believed to have a dynamical origin, involving changes in the mean meridional circulation resulting indirectly from the ozone, temperature, and westerly wind responses in the upper stratosphere.  However, a number of model simulations have suggested that the lower stratospheric response could be an artifact of aliasing from the stratospheric effects of two major volcanic eruptions, El Chich&ograve;n and Pinatubo, that fortuitously occurred following solar cycle maxima in 1982 and 1991.  It is important to establish whether the solar-induced response in the tropical lower s..."
