 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research team will investigate the predictability and upscale evolution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and explore techniques designed to improve quantitative and probabilistic precipitation forecasts of these systems, which serve as a pivotal source of both beneficial and sometimes damaging warm-season rainfall over much of the central U.S. and its associated agricultural belt.  Research will focus on numerical model simulations employing fine-mesh \"convection-allowing\" grid spacings (CAGS) of 2-4 km which explicitly represent thunderstorm-scale circulations and related precipitation processes.  Two main research thrusts are planned.  The first will emphasize understanding the errors present in simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model of the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ), planetary boundary layer (PBL) evolution, and stratiform rain region development and how these features impact simulated MCS evolution.  The second thrust will involve evaluations of basic issues related to low-level jet intensity and the role they play in the growth of MCSs.  An extensive archive of in-house WRF simulations, output from simulations run by outside collaborators, and data from various observational sources would be incorporated, with intellectual merit centered on advancement of the understanding of (1) relationship of LLJ simulation accuracy to prediction of MCSs; (2) impacts of cloud-solar radiation deficiencies within the PBL on MCS simulations; (3) the role of cloud microphysics and near-storm winds on prediction of MCS evolution; and (4) evaluation of neighborhood methodologies applied to ensemble output to improve convective rainfall prediction.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this research will come through expected improvements in forecasts of warm-season convection, which bring considerable societal benefit due to the disruptive nature of severe weather and flooding events.  The researchers plan to work closely with NOAA/National Weather Service personnel to increase the research to operations aspect of the work.  Education would also be emphasized, with multiple students involved in the research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, the predictability of many aspects of thunderstorm systems was studied, making use of numerous computer model simulations.  Early on, it was found that one reason it is very difficult to predict where and when thunderstorm systems will begin is that there is not a good relationship with the amount of rising motion occurring with larger weather systems, unlike with general precipitation once the thundrstorm systems have already formed.  It was also found that there are certain types of thunderstorm systems that are predicted worse than others.  Among the most poorly predicted systems are lines of thundrestorms with large areas of light rain behind them, and bow echoes, thunderstorm systems which accelerate to form a shape like a bow.  This is a serious problem since these bow echoes typically produce large areas of damaging winds in thunderstorm systems.  Even when computer models are run many times in a way to explore even small weather features, bow echoes remain difficult to predict.  To help explore the predictability of these systems, we also adapted an existing technique called the Structure-Amplitude-Location method to use radar data instead of precipitation data.  Our adaptation should help other researchers in the future.  In our exploration, we discovered that when the computer models are adjusted to give information on smaller scales, some thunderstorm systems accelerate and end up moving too fast compared to what actually is observed.   \n\nWe also examined the relationshp between errors in predicteing a strong river of air several thousand feet above the ground which often occurs at night to the errors in the rainfall forecasts from thunderstorm systems.  These rivers of air are known to be very important in keeping the thunderstorm systems alive for long periods of time.  We found that for thunderstorm systems happening in events where the larger-scale weather pattern is known to create rising air, some errors in forecasting the river of air match well errors in the rainfall forecast.  Thus, if a forecaster sees that the computer model is not forecasting the direction of the wind well, he or she can be confident that the rainfall forecast from the model will not be good.  But for thunderstorm systems happening in situations where the larger weather patterns do not usually create much rising motion, it is hard to find good connections, and errors in forecasting the river of air do not match well with the errors in the rainfall forecasts.  \n\nWe also continued to explore a method to create probability forecasts for rainfall using the computer model forecasts of rainfall amount.  We found that it is reasonable to reduce the amount of data coming from the computer model since the probability forecasts remain relatively accurate.\n\nFor all of these tasks, numerous graduate students performed the research and received vital training for their future careers as atmospheric scientists.  Specifically, the funding assisted in some way with the work of three M.S. students and 2 Ph.D. students.  One undergraduate student and one post-doctoral scientist also were supported for short periods to help with the research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William A Gallus"
