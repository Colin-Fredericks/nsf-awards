 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important problems in neurobiology is how memories are maintained in the brain over the course of decades. Traditionally, it has been thought that, after induction and an initial period of consolidation, memories are relatively permanent and resistant to disruption.  Recent evidence, however, indicates that long-term memories are far more labile than previously supposed.  Evidence for the lability of long-term memory has come from studies in which a consolidated memory is reactivated in an animal, typically by giving the animal a stimulus that reminds it of the original learning experience. It has been found that reactivation renders a stored, long-term memory subject to disruption by manipulations, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, that disrupt newly formed memories.  This finding has led to the idea that, upon reactivation, long-term memories undergo a new episode of consolidation (\"reconsolidation\"), during which they are fragile and subject to elimination.  Although the notion that consolidated memories undergo reconsolidation following their reactivation is increasingly accepted by neurobiologists, the mechanisms of memory reconsolidation are poorly understood.  This project will use a simple invertebrate organism to gain general insights into the cellular and molecular processes that mediate memory reconsolidation.  A significant advantage of this model system is that memory reconsolidation can be examined at the level of a single sensorimotor synapse in dissociated cell culture.  This permits rigorous mechanistic analyses of reconsolidation.  Among the questions that will be addressed during the project are the extent to which disruption of reconsolidation of a memory actually eliminates the memory; the similarity between the molecular signaling processes that are involved in original memory consolidation to those involved in memory reconsolidation; and the effect of reconsolidation on the strength of the memory.  The latter question will be examined on both the behavioral and synaptic levels.  The broader impacts of this project include the training of underrepresented graduate students and undergraduates.  In addition, significant public outreach will be undertaken.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of the project was to elucidate the cellular and molecular bases of long-term memory.  The project focused on understanding phenomena related to the disruption of long-term memory.  It has been long appreciated that the stabilization, or consolidation, of memories requires protein synthesis in the brain.  More recently, it has been shown that if a long-term memory is reactivated in an animal, the memory can be disrupted by injecting an inhibitor of protein synthesis into the animal immediately following memory reactivation.  It has been hypothesized that the reactivation of the memory triggers a new round of memory consolidation?termed memory ?reconsolidation??and that reconsolidation, like the original consolidation, requires protein synthesis.  Therefore, it has been asserted, if protein synthesis is blocked when a memory is reactivated, reconsolidation fails, and the original memory is erased.\n\n We tested these ideas using a simple model system, the marine snail Aplysia.  This invertebrate animal has a simple defensive withdrawal reflex that exhibits a form of nonassociative memory referred to as sensitization.  Sensitization can be induced by giving the animal a noxious stimulus, for example, moderate tail shocks.  Following the delivery of such noxious stimulation, the defensive withdrawal reflex becomes strengthened (sensitized).  If repeated bouts of noxious stimulation are delivered to an Aplysia, the reflex can undergo sensitization that persists for a week or more.  Long-term sensitization represents a simple form of long-term memory.  Reconsolidation of the memory for long-term sensitization can be induced by giving a long-term sensitized animal a single tail shock twenty-four hours or more after original sensitization training; if the animal receives an injection of a protein synthesis inhibitor immediately after the tail shock, twenty-four hours later the animal exhibits no prolongation of its reflex, suggesting erasure of the memory for long-term sensitization.  However, we observed that the long-term memory could be reinstated if the animal was subsequently given truncated sensitization training, training that induces memory lasting for several hours, but not for twenty-four hours or more (long-term memory).  This suggested that the reconsolidation blockade protocol did not erase the long-term memory but, rather, somehow prevented its expression.\n\n To explore this idea further, we performed experiments on synapses between sensory and motor neurons, the neurons that mediate the withdrawal reflex in Aplysia.  The sensory-motor synapse undergoes long-term facilitation in animals that have received training that induces long-term sensitization.  Long-term facilitation can also be induced at synapses in cell cultures of sensory and motor neurons by repeated application of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is known to mediate sensitization in Aplysia.  We showed that reconsolidation of this synaptic memory can be blocked if application of a single pulse of serotonin, which induces only short-term synaptic facilitation, is immediately followed by treatment with an inhibitor of protein synthesis.  This reconsolidation blockade protocol appeared to eliminate the synaptic facilitation due to the training with repeated pulses of serotonin.  However, the disrupted synaptic memory could be reinstated by truncated serotonin training.  This suggests that the synaptic memory persisted, albeit occultly, following reconsolidation blockade.\n\n In additional experiments we examined the effect of reconsolidation blockade on the synaptic morphology.  These experiments involved labeling of sensory and motor neurons in cell culture with nontoxic fluorescent dyes and repeatedly imaging their fine structure using a high-powered microscope.  Previously, it had been observed that long-term synaptic facilitation is accompanied by approximately a doubling of the number of presynaptic sites of neurotransmission (termed presynaptic varicosities).  We investigated whether reconsolidation blockade erased this long-term morphological change.  Accordingly, we first treated sensory-motor connections with repeated pulses of serotonin sufficient to induce long-term facilitation, and twenty-four hours later subjected them to reconsolidation blockade using a single pulse of serotonin immediately followed by treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor.  When the synapses were microscopically inspected twenty-four hours afterward, the number of presynaptic varicosities had reverted to the pre-training level.  Thus, reconsolidation blockade reversed the synaptic growth that normally accompanies long-term facilitation.  Surprisingly, however, the retraction of the varicosities appeared random: there was equal retraction of varicosities present prior to the serotonin training as there was of varicosities that had grown due to the serotonin training.  This result implies that long-term memory is not stored at synapses, as widely believed.\n\n The results obtained during the project challenge current thinking about how long-term memories are stored.  In particular, our results indicate that long-term memory can persist following reconsolidation blockade, despite the absence of learning-induced behavioral and synaptic changes.  Furthermore, our results argue against the idea that long-term memory is stored as persistent synaptic changes.  The results from the project have important implications for understanding the biological basis of memory, as well as for the development of effective treatments for disorders of long-term memory.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Glanzman"
