 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting two programs at Boston College to address the need for highly qualified mathematics teachers in high-need school districts. The Boston College Department of Teacher Education (The Lynch School of Education) and Department of Mathematics (College of Arts and Sciences), working together with the non-profit Math for America (MfA) Boston and with colleagues at Boston University and Education Development Center, are offering a Teaching Fellow (TF) program and a Master Teaching Fellow (MTF) program.  Two highly select groups of preservice high school teachers (Teaching Fellows) are participating in a five-year integrated program of study  that includes a one-year Master of Science in Teaching and systematic professional development over a four-year period during their formative years as new teachers in Boston and Framingham school districts.  The project provides an integrated curriculum that seamlessly interweaves content, pedagogical content knowledge, and pedagogy.  The Teaching Fellowship program is grounded in research and based on prior successful models of mathematics teacher preparation that have a high teacher retention rate in urban districts. Eight experienced teachers (Master Teaching Fellows) from the high-need school districts of Boston and Framingham are involved in mentoring the Teaching Fellows and are participating in the mathematics professional and curriculum development seminars and workshops. With the support of their school districts, the MTFs, in close liaison with mathematicians and mathematics educators, are assuming leadership roles in reforming mathematics teaching and learning. The goals of the project are to: 1) Increase the output of the current Masters level mathematics teacher preparation program at Boston College by preparing eight Teaching Fellows (TFs) to become excellent mathematics teachers for high-need schools; 2) Recruit and support eight outstanding practicing teachers (Master Teaching Fellow) in mathematics from high-need school districts to become highly qualified instructional leaders and mentors; and 3) Build a strong and lasting professional community of mathematicians, mathematics educators and teachers in the greater Boston area by combining the resources of Boston College, MfA Boston and the EDC and to develop the long-term infrastructure neccessary to support this community.",
