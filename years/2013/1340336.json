 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers propose to further the development of high power density layered-layered CNT/active materials based cathodes and anodes for Li-ion battery. This layered-layered nanomaterial based electrode architecture designed to be compatible with various Li-ion materials was developed using a room temperature and pressure processes. Coin cell battery prototypes in full as well as half-cell configuration were fabricated and tested. Preliminary results indicate that these electrode architectures can have very high power density at a fast charge/discharge rate and long cycle life. \r\n\r\nThis battery electrode technology may have a large economic impact by enabling the realization of low cost all electric (EV), plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and renewable energy storage devices. It will also exhibit the advantages of incorporating nanotechnology into macroscopic devices. The layered-layered electrode technology is compatible with various types of active materials and can be readily incorporated into the existing manufacturing process, enabling the use of commercially available materials. This technology will aid researchers in understanding the impact of electrode architecture and geometry on the performance metrics for energy storage devices.",

Two papers were presented in conference and the patent filling has been extended to include Europe, china and South korea. \n\n \n\nUsing micron-sized spinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) in these electrode architectures, we demonstrated a significant increase in power density of a lithium ion cathode with high active material loading in the range of 8-10mg/cm2 and low carbon contents of 10% and 20%.  At a high discharge rate of 10C, a multi-layered electrode containing a high active material loading of 9 mg/cm2 demonstrates greater than 65% capacity retention and highly stable cycling for over 100 cycles while the conventionally prepared electrode exhibits less than 10% capacity retention at a loading of 2 mg/cm2. These values translate to an enhancement in power density by 20 times over a conventionally prepared cathode of identical composition. We also demonstrate improvement in volumetric density by a factor of 3 over a conventionally prepared electrode. This multi-layer structure when used in conjunction with a low-rate lithium ion cathode material, such as the high capacity lithium-rich lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, 0.3Li2MnO3 0...."
