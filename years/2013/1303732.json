 "awd_abstract_narration": "OP-TEC's mission is to build the capacity of U.S. two-year colleges to provide the quality and quantity of photonics technicians needed in this critical field.  To date the center has: Developed seven exemplary Partner Colleges that serve as models, mentors, test sites and regional leaders in specialized photonics technician areas; Launched four Regional Photonics Clusters of employers and colleges, using Partner Colleges for leadership; Supported nine colleges in initiating new photonics AAS degree programs; Assisted five colleges to restore declining or closed photonics programs; Worked with 108 colleges to plan new programs; and Developed a strategy for increasing the number of high school students who enter the optics and photonics field. In addition the center has conducted faculty development, developed curricular material, and has begun work developing a program for precision optics.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the center, along with Partner Colleges and in cooperation with business and industry, is encouraging and developing additional optics and photonics programs or optics and photonics specializations within related majors (for example, in engineering technology) at two-year colleges; developing additional ways to attract more students into these program; developing course material in emerging areas; providing faculty development; enlarging strategies to recruit veterans with related experience into the programs; increasing the number of members of groups under-represented in these programs; and developing short programs for technicians already in the field. The center is developing materials and encouraging colleges to develop concentrations in precision optics to meet employer demand \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this proposal resides in its focus on photonics, photonics-enabled technologies, precision optics, and emerging applications of photonics that impact U.S. security and economic development. Expanding capacity for producing photonics and precision optics technicians also guarantees that there are rewarding jobs for US students and that employed technicians receive additional education and training to secure their jobs and support needed technical innovation.  \r\n\r\nThe  Broader Impacts lie in 1) growth in student completers due to increase in programs and enrollment  through OP-TEC outreach/retention strategies, including regional clusters/centers, 2) expansion of  photonics education in photonics-enabled  technologies, retraining employed technicians and  developing precision optics programs, and 3) new efforts to attract returning veterans and  underrepresented populations by educating faculty and administrators in diversity awareness as well as recruitment  and retention strategies.",

Expand the number of educational courses and programs in optics  and photonics offered by colleges and high schools.\n\nExpanded and strengthened photonics education from 12 to 36 U.S. colleges, which increased the number of new photonics techs entering the workforce from under 200 to over 500 annually. Over 200 employed technicians, transferring into this field, have also received education and training in lasers, optics and laser safety from colleges supported by OP-TEC. \nAssisted new program startups by a) providing lists of photonics employers in the college service area, b) facilitating employers needs assessment surveys, c) program planning, including lab design, equipment and laser safety, and d) student recruitment and retention. \n\n\nExpanding the number of programs and improving student recruiting efforts maximizes capability to reach a wider audience base, ultimately engaging a larger number of underrepresented populations, including women, minorities, veterans, those living in rural areas or those participating in distance learning while serving overseas in photonics-enabled technician programs.\n\nOP-TEC has also supported and assisted other technician education programs to infuse laser and optics courses into curricula where photonics is an enabling technology.\n\n\n 4.  Provide education and training for administrators, counselors, high  school teachers, and community college faculty members to prepare  them to (a) design new photonics technology programs (b) infuse  photonics into programs in photonics-?enabled technologies; and (c)  teach optics, photonics, and laser courses.\n\nUsing on-line training, followed by two and three-day lab experiences, OP-TEC prepared over 200 new faculty to teach optics and laser courses. OP-TEC has also provided professional development to faculty through webinars and supported for them to attend meetings and technical conferences.\n\n\n 5.  Identify and support the emergence of new technologies, including  alternative energy, that require technician knowledge and skills in optics  and photonics.\n\nEmerging applications of optics and photonics, supported by OP-TEC included vertical-cavity, surface-emitting diodes, nanophononics, integrated(silicon)photonics, wearable sensors and laser-assisted additive manufacturing.\n\n\nSustaining the Impact of OP-TEC\n\nOP-TEC efforts to sustain and continue our impact have been achieved by transferring all resources and responsibilities to the NSF/ATE Center LASER-TEC.
