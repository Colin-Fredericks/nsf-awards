The guiding questions for this study are: (1) What MESA Community College Program (MCCP) activities are especially helpful in improving self-efficacy or motivation in STEM for underrepresented students and, (2) How are students' perceptions of STEM disciplines influenced by their participation in MCCP activities? This project will ascertain the value of the MESA model as a method to develop local STEM talent and learning communities among underrepresented populations in varied settings (rural/urban).",
