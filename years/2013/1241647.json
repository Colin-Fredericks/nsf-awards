 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the cyber threat continues to grow at an exponential pace, the US is challenged to find cybersecurity leaders who are equipped with technical cybersecurity knowledge and an understanding of the organizational phenomena that impact the successful implementation of cybersecurity initiatives. The HOLISTiC (Human & Organizational Learning - Integrated STudies in Cybersecurity) program is meeting this challenge by piloting a doctoral-level Cybercorps program to develop cybersecurity leaders who are able to effectively navigate the complex and unpredictable cybersecurity environment. \r\n \r\nHOLISTiC is being implemented within the George Washington University (GW) Executive Leadership Doctoral Program (ELP) in Human and Organizational Learning (HOL). Working closely with the ELP program faculty and advisors, and through the integration of dissertation research from program entry, students are working toward the completion of doctoral degree requirements in 3 years. The HOLISTiC program is producing 6 cybersecurity leaders who have a strong technical foundation and expertise in key areas such as risk analysis, information management, and organizational change; a portfolio of advanced research and analysis skills; establishing a community of practice that engages students and cybersecurity experts in collective dialogue, and; driving the development of practically-based, rigorous research on cybersecurity challenges that span technical and non-technical areas.",
