The 2013 Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials & Devices (WOCSEMMAD) will address research areas in III-V compound semiconductor field. It is one of the few workshop format meetings where the latest results can be debated and discussed in a relatively open format. \r\nWOCSEMMAD has played a key role in identifying new directions for research.  It is one of the few workshops where presentations are required to focus only on important new data, and last minute results. Less-than-successful results are also very welcome since they allow the participants to discuss the difficulties encountered and propose new approaches.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWOCSEMMAD report\n\nThe 2013 Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials and Devices (WOCSEMMAD) covers advanced and compound semiconductor issues and it has a workshop format where the latest results can be debated and discussed in an open format.  The invitation list is managed to insure participation by young investigators, graduate students, and well-known contributors.\n\nThe program provides many opportunities for informal scientific exchanges and discussions.  The presentations consist of 5 minute talks and 5 minute Q&amp;A sessions with talks focused on important new data and up-to-the-minute results; in fact, unpublished results or discussion of new aspects of recently published results is required. \n\nA special topic on THz devices augmented the program.  Highlights of the workshop are shared with a European workshop (and highlights from the European workshop are shared with 'WOX' attendees) to further broaden the discussion and provide opportunities for even more areas of networking. \n\nThe organizing committee takes great care to invite researchers who provide presentations which are open, detailed and use unpublished data.  The event makes special efforts to incldue women, minorities, and women.  Many graduate stdeutn speakers from prior meetings now contribute as faculty members at a variety of instituions.\n\nThe NSF funds were used to defray the costs for all graduate stduent participanst (15 graduate stduents) as well as provide AV support for all conference attendees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark S Goorsky"
