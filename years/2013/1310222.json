Vanden Bout of the University of Texas at Austin to develop strategies to study the fundamental nature of energy transport in supramolecular and macromolecular organic systems such as tubular molecular aggregates, single conjugated polymers, and polymer aggregates. The research program investigates the properties of these materials for energy transport applications by combining a number of super-resolution imaging techniques.  A goal is to directly probe energy transport in individual nanoscale systems, coupling both temperature and electric field dependence measurements to examine how disorder and electronic coupling affect energy migration. By studying both polymer systems as well as self-assembled supramolecular systems, the results will help to separate the effects of intra- and intermolecular interactions in energy transfer events.\r\n\r\nBy studying how energy can be collected and moved in organic materials, this research will help to formulate new materials for light harvesting and solar energy. The research will use methods that directly probe the migration of energy in individual systems to overcome the inherent complexities of the bulk materials.  The research project will also seek to increase the number and diversity of students pursuing chemical research via the inclusion of undergraduate students in the research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlants harvest light energy from arrays of antenna molecules that transport those excitations to a locations where it can be converted into chemical energy.  The antennas consist of large numbers of interacting molecules.  These collections of molecules or supramolecular systems have properties that are distinct from those of the individual molecules that make up the assembly.  The light excitations in these supramolecular systems are called \"excitons\"  and consist of energy that is spread out over many molecules  Of greatest interest is the fact that the excitons can move around the antenna system.  This research examined the properties of artificial antenna systems in both assemblies of dye  molecules that mimicked natural systems as well as plastic electronics that have been described using similar delocalized excitons.  Most studies that have looked at energy transfer in these systems in the past could only examine the motion of the excitons indirectly.  In this research we directly visualized the energy spreading out spatially in these materials using super resolution microscopy.  Not only were we able to directly image the extent of the exciton migration, but we found evidence that the excitons can move much farther than many had predicted.  The initial light excitations was found to spread out over a distance of nearly one micron along bundles of the antenna material.  With this distance (1/1000 of a millimeter) is small from a macroscopic sense it is extremely large compared to the size of the molecules.  Moreover, it is well beyond the length needed for a number of interesting applications.  The one micron distance was also nearly ten times farther than previously predicted.  We followed up on this work by embedding the materials into a polymer films to see how environment affected the transport.  We also looked model electronic plastics to see how the folding of the molecules affected energy transport.   These results have inspired a number of similar studies from other research groups as chemists try to assemble systems that allow for long range directed energy transport of light excitations. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Vanden Bout"
