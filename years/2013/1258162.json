 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fungi are remarkable for the ecological niches they occupy and the ecological services they provide in both human-made and natural ecosystems. This project will investigate the genomic evolution of a large order of fungi, Hypocreales, which is diverse in both number of species and ecological functions. This research will involve sequencing of genomes and comparative analyses that focus on genome scale changes that promote shifts in ecologies (e.g., decomposers vs. pathogens) and nutritional modes (e.g., plant vs. animal-based carbon sources). The project is interdisciplinary and collaborative, employing tools from biological and computational sciences and researchers from three continents.  \r\n\r\nFungi are promising sources of pharmaceuticals, alternatives for control of insect pests and bioremediation of contaminated soils, and essential in the development of biofuels.  In order to exploit fungi for the betterment of society, however, a more robust understanding of patterns and processes that have led to the diversification of their genomes and subsequently their metabolism is necessary. To achieve these advancements,  more students and young researchers trained in an interdisciplinary manner are needed, with the result being a qualified generation of scientists in academia, industry and government agencies equipped to study biological solutions to the challenges of the modern World.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFungi are essential components of all ecosystems and provide numerous ecological services, from beneficial symbionts to antagonistic pathogens to decomposers of organic matter.  This breadth of these ecologies can be performed by closely related species that have undergone host/substrate shifts during their evolutionary history.  This research is focused on a group of fungi, the Hypocreales, which serves as a model system for understanding how fungi evolve to associate with distantly related hosts and become reliant on qualitatively different substrates for nutrition.  Species of Hypocreales can be pathogens of plants or animals, beneficial or benign inhabitants of plant tissues (an ecology called endophytes), decomposers of plant debris, or even parasites of other fungi.  In addition, species of Hypocreales produce a diversity of natural compounds some of which function as toxins and must be prevented from entering human food supply (e.g., mycotoxins) and others that have been developed into life saving pharmaceuticals (e.g., cylcosporin used in organ transplation).  To decipher the patterns and processes underpinning these changes in host and substrate associations scientists must develop a robust understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the fungi involved.  We sequenced the genomes of species of fungi that spanned the diversity of Hypocreales and combined them with data generated by collaborating scientists and the larger fungal biology community.  Analyses of these data resulted in the following findings: 1) The common ancestor of Hypocreales was associated with plants as pathogens and plant endophytes.  2) Pathogens of animals are a derived ecology and represent an interkingdom host shift from plant to animals.  3) Reversals to plant associated fungi have occurred but these fungi have a low incidence of plant pathogenesis and are mostly endophytes.  Importantly, these endophytes retain anti-insect activities such as antiherbivory and can have a beneficial relationship with plants.  4) Shifts involving fungi parasitizing other fungi have occurred multiple times, but more frequently from animal pathogen ancestors.  These evolutionary shifts in host and substrate utilization resulted in a changes in the genomic content of enzymes necessary to metabolize unique carbon and nitrogen sources.  This research provides a strong foundation for numerous fields of biology including plant pathology and safe food supply; biological control of insect pests to reduce the reliance on pesticides; and bioprospecting for biologically active compounds for development of pharmaceuticals.  Research supported by this grant involved the cross-training of four young scientists in fungal biology, genomics and computational biology.  This research also supported the development of international collaborations, which is essential we strive to understand better the Earth?s biodiversity and its potential uses by humans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph W Spatafora"
