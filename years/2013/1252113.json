 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 5-year research proposal lays out a set of studies that will be conducted across 3 sites (UC-Riverside, Northwestern University, and Georgetown University) with 18 month old to 6 year old children to explore how the relationships that children form with fictional characters (called parasocial) in DVDs and other digital media utilizing intelligent agents influence their learning of STEM concepts. The studies, though all focused on social attachment with media figures, use different measures and different stimuli: some assess children's perceptions of known media characters, while others introduce novel artifacts such as interactional toys. Little is known about how children's relationships with characters traverse different media platforms and whether similar learning principles apply in different media environments. In this research, the collaborative group of investigators brings the developmental and communication research areas into contact with the work in the learning sciences in a series of studies examining the formation and impact of parasocial relationships with characters in the toddler and preschool years. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses children's social experiences with characters on TV, DVDs, or as intelligent on-line agents (called avatars), and how these experiences can support STEM learning. Young children form strong relationships with their favorite characters. These characters can be used as positive role models for children and also have the potential to provide continuity for children as they are exposed to math and science in different environments (e.g., home, school). The guidelines and principles derived from this work should help policy makers, educators, and companies make better use of the media characters that pervade the daily experiences of children to improve STEM education.",

The studies in this grant emerged because of the need for U.S. children to develop better math and science skills for academic success in the 21st century. \n\nMedia characters are young children?s friends and social partners, providing potential avenues for them to learn STEM skills via close relationships and interactive experiences.  This research builds on past scholarship involving the benefits of children's emotionally tinged relationships with media characters (parasocial relationships), and on their spoken interactions with characters (parasocial interactions) in which socially contingent replies are given about academic content.\n\nAn initial line of studies addressed what a parasocial relationship is.  According to young children, these relationships involve a perceived friendship with a trusted character who is cute and makes them feel safe.  Parents report that these relationships with a specific character last about 2 and a half years for their offspring, at which point children break up with that character, moving on to characters who are more developmentally advanced.  Overall, we discovered that parasocial relationships parallel the kinds of relationships that children form with their peers.\n\n In a study with toddlers, we discovered that interactive plush toy characters who were personalized to children (knew the child?s name, had the same favorite colors and foods as the character) led to better performance after viewing that character perform a math task on a screen.  The closer the relationship with the character was, as demonstrated by nurturing behaviors such as pretending to put the character to bed or feed the character, the more children subsequently learned. For preschool-aged children, trust in a character also led to better learning of STEM content.\n\nBuilding on these findings, we did a series of studies involving an intelligent character using Dora the Explorer, who was designed to elicit and respond to children?s math talk.  The targeted activity was a key math concept, the add-1 rule: knowing that adding one to a number increases the total sum by a single unit.  In three studies, we discovered that children could learn the add-1 rule when they had closer parasocial relationships with the character and when they received socially contingent replies from the character.  Having a virtual character interact with children, as opposed to only hearing a human voice during the virtual game, and receiving socially contingent replies to their math talk, led to better transfer of the add-1 rule to physical objects. \n\nChildren?s parasocial relationships and parasocial interactions with media characters, then, can provide a new pathway for 21st century education, with popular media characters bridging the traditional boundaries between virtual and physical settings. The implication of these studies is that intelligent character applications are part of the educational horizon as children?s trusted peers and teachers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sandra Calvert"
