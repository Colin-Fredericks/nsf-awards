 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diatoms are responsible for a significant fraction of primary production in the ocean. They are associated with enhanced carbon export and usually dominate the response of phytoplankton to additions of the micronutrient iron in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. Diatoms, particularly those isolated from the open ocean, appear to have a significant capacity to store iron for later use, and in some groups of diatoms this ability is enabled by the iron storage protein ferritin. Such luxury uptake of iron has long been observed in laboratory cultures and hypothesized to provide diatoms with an ecological benefit in the low-iron waters that cover 40% of the global ocean. However iron storage has been difficult to observe in natural systems due to the methodological challenges of working with mixed plankton assemblages, and a physiological understanding of the impacts of iron on ocean diatoms is lacking. This project combines state-of-the-art high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing and single-cell element analysis with novel laboratory and field incubation experiments to quantify iron storage abilities of cultured and natural diatoms that either contain or lack ferritin and determine the ecological impacts of this process. The overall objective of this project is to examine the ecological importance of iron storage as a selective mechanism controlling the distributions of diatoms along iron gradients in marine ecosystems. The proposed research includes three specific objectives:\r\nA. Determine if there is a consistent physiological difference in the ability of pennate versus centric diatoms to store iron.\r\nB. Examine whether iron storage capacities across diverse diatom taxa consistently provide a mechanistic explanation for continued growth in the absence of iron.\r\nC. Determine whether enhanced iron storage provides diatoms with a competitive within natural phytoplankton assemblages in both coastal and oceanic regions.\r\nTranscriptomic sequencing on a variety of ecologically important pennate and centric diatoms will be used to survey for the presence of ferritin-like genes in order to establish biogeographical and/or phylogenetic patterns of occurrence of diatom ferritin. Laboratory culture experiments will be used to quantify the iron storage abilities of these diatoms, as well as the number of cell divisions that can be supported by the stored iron, providing valuable physiological data to inform the understanding of plankton ecology in iron-limited coastal and HNLC systems. The laboratory experiments will be complemented by measurements of ferritin expression and iron storage in coastal and ocean diatoms sampled across gradients of iron availability on two cruises-of-opportunity to the northeast Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: By characterizing the diversity in potential iron storage capacities of diatoms and elucidating the role ferritins play in enhancing iron storage and the iron-limitation response, this project will provide new insights into how this important group of primary producers has adapted to their environment, thus contributing to our knowledge of what factors influence their abundance and distributions. This knowledge is especially important in relation to predicting the future effects of climate change on these organisms that are responsible for significant primary production in marine ecosystems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project incorporates several activities that will directly contribute to education and training. The training of a graduate student, post-doctoral researcher and multiple undergraduates will be directly supported. Additionally, a broader impact goal of this project is to facilitate teaching and learning on marine science-related topics through translating our research objectives into widely distributed educational materials that can be used in the classroom. To accomplish this, a high-school teacher will participate in one of the cruises and convey her experiences at sea to her students as well as develop curricular materials for her class. These will be used for high-school earth and environmental science courses and also distributed to teachers in Maine as part of Bigelow Laboratories teacher training program, thus broadening the scope of the outreach activities.",
