  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe scientific studies in this project focused on developing\nself-consistent theoretical models of the star-forming interstellar\nmedium, mainly using computer simulations that follow the dynamical\nequations govering flows of gas and radiation, and account for\nmagnetic fields, gravity, and the energy ``feedback'' injected by\nstars.  The effects of star formation feedback are important both on\nthe scale of individual clouds and on the scale of the whole galactic\ndisk, and in this project we have studied both.\n\nFor our large scale models, we developed a new computational framework\ncalled ``TIGRESS'' -- this acronym stands for ``Three-phase\nInterstellar medium in Galaxies Resolving Evolution with Star\nformation and Supernova feedback.''  The TIGRESS framework allows us\nto follow the interstellar medium, star formation, and feedback\nself-consistently over very long timescales and over spatial scales\nfrom a few light years to a few tens of thousands of light years,\naccurately including the important physical processes described above\n(and more).  We have documented the algorithms adopted in the TIGRESS\nframework, as well as numerical accuracy of our model results, in a\ncomprehensive publication.  The TIGRESS framework can be applied to\nmake theoretical models of interstellar gas properties in a wide range\nof galaxies, and as a first application we have run numerical\nsimulations for enviroments similar to that surrounding the Sun in our\nown Milky Way.  We also used this model to make predictions for new\nobservations and to interpret existing observations.  This included a\nthorough study of how to interpret observed emission from carbon\nmonoxide (CO) interstellar gas, the most commonly observed molecule in\nthe Universe.  Our study of synthetic CO emission also required the\ndevelopment of a new chemical network that we expect to be adopted\nwidely by other researchers.  Our TIGRESS models also make predictions\nfor the properties of a large-scale wind that may be driven away from\nthe disk of the Milky Way into the halo surrounding our galaxy.  We\nhave conducted idealized studies of individual supernova-driven\nbubbles that are complementary to our TIGRESS models.\n\nIn other galactic-scale work, we used our computational models of the\nlarge-scale interstellar medium to collaborate with other theoretical\nand computational groups from other universities. The PI has also been involved\nin teams that have obtained and analyzed observations of star-forming\ngas in both normal and starburst galaxies\n\nOur small-scale models have focused on how giant molecular clouds\nevolve in response to the radiation emitted when star clusters form in\ntheir interior.  The strong radiation from young star clusters creates\nspectacular ionized nebulae in their immediate enviroment -- many of\nthe most well-publicized images from ground- and space-based optical,\ninfrared, and ultaviolet telescopes are of these nebulae surrounding\nstar clusters.  These ionized nebulae -- as well as the non-ionizing\nradiation also emitted from stars -- are believed to play a role in\nthe longstanding question of what determines the star formation\n``efficiency'' in a cloud.  Having developed and implemented a new\nnumerical method for following the interaction of radiation with gas\n(under support of a previous NSF grant), we used this implementation\nto run detailed computer models of the effects of radiation pressure\nin star-forming clouds.  We considered two regimes, and a range of\ndifferent cloud properties in each regime.  \nThe combination of ionized gas and radiation pressure is likely to be\nmore effective than radiation pressure by itself, in dispersing gas\nfrom clouds.  We were therefore motivated to implement a new\n``ray-tracing'' algorithm so that we can study both mechanisms\nsimultaneously, which we did working with collaborators from Korea.\nThis is now enabling us to study a range of cloud models, which we are pursuing\nwith support from a new NSF award.  \n\nAltogether, the research program was quite successful, leading to 16\npapers published or submitted for publication in refereed journals\nover the period of the grant. In addition, the PI and other members of\nthe team gave talks to disseminate the results of research.  \n\nThe most important Broader Impact of this project was in training and\nmentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. Two\nundergraduate students, four graduate students, and two postdoctoral\nscholars took part in the project, and as a result were trained in\nadvanced computational research methods and mentored in preparing\nresults for presentation and publication. One student who received his\nPhD moved on to a data science position in industry, another PhD\ngraduate took a postdoctoral research position, while the postdoctoral\nresearcher who completed his term took a position at a national\nresearch laboratory.   In addition, the PI and team members used\nresearch results from the project as part of instructional curricula\nand public outreach, and software developed for this effort will be\nfreely shared with the larger community beyond our university.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eve C Ostriker"
