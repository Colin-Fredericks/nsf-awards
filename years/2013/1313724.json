Galloway\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator proposes to continue his work on two basic research directions: (i) the geometry and topology of initial data sets in general relativity, and (ii) spacetime rigidity results.\r\n\r\nAn initial data set in a spacetime M consists of a smooth spacelike hypersurface V, its induced metric h and second fundamental form K.  A 'marginally outer trapped surface' (MOTS) in V is a closed two-sided hypersurface whose out-going light rays have vanishing divergence. The presence of a MOTS signals a gravitationally extreme situation: Generically one expects the development of singularities and the formation of a black hole.  MOTSs arose in a more purely mathematical context in the work of Schoen and Yau concerning the existence of solutions to Jang's equation, in connection with their proof of positivity of mass. In a time-symmetric (K =0) initial data set a MOTS is simply a (2-sided) minimal surface.  An important theme in minimal surface theory for many years has been the use of minimal surfaces to study the topology of Riemannian manifolds.  In a similar vein, motivated by results on topological censorship (which are global in time results), the PI and collaborators, M. Eichmair and D.  Pollack, have recently studied the relationship between the topology of 3-dimensional asymptotically flat initial data sets and the occurrence of MOTSs.  In particular, using a consequence of geometrization and recent existence results for MOTSs, they have shown that non-trivial topology implies the existence of (immersed) MOTSs.  This can be interpreted as a non-time symmetric version of results of Meeks- Simons-Yau. This work raises many interesting questions that the PI proposes to work on, particularly in the context of higher dimensional initial data manifolds with inner horizon (MOTS boundary) which satisfy the 'dominant energy condition', a physically natural curvature condition.  The approach advocated makes use of the connection between solutions of Jang's equation and MOTSs.  Various rigidity problems will also be addressed, in connection with the aforementioned work, the PI's previous work with R. Schoen on the topology of black holes and the PI's recent work with Carlos Vega concerning a spacetime rigidity problem originally posed by Yau, a concrete version of which is known as the Bartnik splitting conjecture.\r\n\r\nModern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and light cones).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEinstein's General Theory of Relativity is a 'geometric' theory of gravity.  The field equations of General Relativity (known as the Einstein equations) describe how our space-time universe curves in the presence of matter, and it is this curvature that is responsible for the effects of gravity. As the famous physicist John Wheeler put it \"Matter tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells matter how to move\".  The field of Mathematical General Relativity,  to which this project belongs, explores the consequences of the Einstein equations in spacetime models that can represent a single star or the entire universe.  Black holes (which can result from the gravitational collapse of a star after exhausting its nuclear fuel) are certainly one of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity.   In the  1970's, Stephen Hawking presented his work on the theoretical and mathematical foundations of black holes.  Since then significant progress has been made in our understanding of black holes.  Our current understanding of gravitational collapse is consistent with the remarkable detection of gravitational waves announced by LIGO in 2016, and predicted by Einstein 100 years earlier. \n\n A number of the findings of this project stem from concepts and properties considered in Hawking's foundational work, such as marginally out trapped surfaces (or apparent horizons),  the topology of black holes and the subsequent development of the notion of topological censorship, and the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions, which are the most important solutions of the Einstein equations that describe black holes (nonrotating and rotating, respectively).  \n\nSeveral outcomes of this project concern the geometry and topology of general relativistic initial data sets with horizons.  An initial data set in spacetime consists of a spacelike hypersurface V (which represents space at a given instant of time), its induced metric g (which enables one to measure distances in V) and its second fundamental form (which describes the initial velocity of V wiithin spacetime).  At the initial data level, a black hole horizon is represented by a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS).  The notion of topological censorship has to do with the idea that the region of space outside of all black holes should have a simple topological structure, i.e., that nontrivial topological structures (such as wormholes)  should end up hidden behind the black hole event horizon.   Classical results supporting topological censorship involve assumptions that are global in time, and, as such, are difficult to verify - one must be able to predict the entire future evolution of the universe.  The aim of some of the recent research of the PI has been to obtain results supportive of the principle of topological censorship at the pure initial data level, thereby circumventing these difficult issues of global evolution.   The current project has made significant contributions to this area. This includes work (carried out in conjunction with K. Baker) establishing the topological simplicity of 3-dimensional initial data sets with MOTS boundary (which represents space outside of a black hole) having higher genus ends. This generalizes previous work of the PI with M. Eichmair and D. Pollack on the spherical end case.   By quite different methods, the PI, in work with L. Andersson, M. Dahl and D. Pollack, has obtained a result for higher dimensional initial data sets with MOTS boundary.

This result also recovers earlier work of the PI with R. Schoen on the topology of black holes (albeit under stronger assumptions). \n\nOther outcomes of this project include work with C.
