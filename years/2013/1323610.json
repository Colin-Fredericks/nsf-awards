 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a recognized need of the 21st century technological society - broadening participation in computing education. The project is transforming STEM education by building a nationwide community of educators, who are teaching students to synthesize the creativity and design of art with the mathematical rigor and formality of computer science, technology, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe Computing in the Arts (CITA) model curriculum consists of 50 hours of computing courses, arts courses, and synthesis courses. Graduates of CITA are educated to create, design, and code new creativity tools. From contemporary music, art and theater production, to new forms of animation and digital media, to the visual and audio systems of tomorrow's computers, to revolutionary web applications, CITA prepares students for productive and integrated careers in the information and arts economies. The CITA model maximizes reuse of existing courses and faculty expertise, and thus facilitates adaptation. In this collaborative project the CITA model has already been successfully implemented at the lead institution, where there are currently 46 majors (a 22% increase), mainly from an underserved population - students interested in the arts.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on dissemination - successes and synthesis with other complementary approaches with partner institutions to build a strong, diversified community of educators interested in adopting and further developing innovative CITA instructional materials. This community is being forged through three faculty workshops, special sessions at the annual conference for Computer Science Education, and a website of pedagogical materials. The evaluation plan involves an independent evaluator, and various quantitative and qualitative outcomes that assess (a) the formation of a thriving CITA community, (b) dissemination efforts, and (c) the impact on transforming STEM education.",

Jennifer Burg arranged and coordinated the workshop at Wake Forest University in 2014. Lead PI Bill Manaris and Ren&eacute;e McCauley hosted the workshop at the College of Charleston in 2015, and Susan Reiser and Rebecca Bruce hosted the workshop at UNC Asheville in 2017. These three summer workshops involved over 70 computer science and arts faculty from across the U.S. These workshops resulted in the development of various ways of synthesizing computer science and arts, including creation of new synthesis courses, modifications to traditional computing courses, development of new CITA-like curricula, design of CITA-like project experiences for undergrads, and other creative endeavors combining computer science techniques and traditional art practices and theory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main role of PI's Reiser and Bruce in the collaborative grant was to provide the tangible computing projects relevant to the theme of each workshop.&nbsp;During the academic year we developed projects and modules that we test-taught in relevant classes: specifically, the Introduction to Mechatronics Engineering, the Introduction to Computing and New Media (CS0 taught on the EBCI's -- Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian -- Qualla Boundary), Introduction to Programming Media Applications (CS1 in Processing), and Creative Fabrication: Art Meets Technology. We synthesized each year's class projects into a different single activity for each of the three years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the grant is that it provided an invaluable opportunity to share and develop our Computing + Art experiences and to learn the curricular approaches and activities at Wake Forest and the College of Charleston and those of our approximately 70 workshop attendees from across the United States. Workshop attendees had an opportunity to gain new ideas for inter-disciplinary projects and curriculum material for computing in the arts programs. These workshops and related presentations provide materials that support teaching computer science and computational thinking in arts and humanities programs, as well as traditional computer science courses via the use of creative applications, assignments, and projects. Following their workshop experience, attendees proposed or initiated 8 new inter-disciplinary CITA programs or degrees, 6 new inter-disciplinary or inter-institutional CITA collaborations, and 13 new CITA courses after attending our workshops.</p>\n<p>Broadening participation and excellence in computing education was and is a goal of the PIs and the NSF. We believe teaching students to synthesize the creativity and design of art with the mathematical rigor and formality of computer science and engineering is an effective strategy to teach technology and the much sought-after 21<sup>&nbsp;</sup>century skills &ndash; communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. At UNC Asheville, combining majority male engineering courses with majority female sculpture courses results in gender balance and allows authentic interdisciplinary collaboration. An introductory computer science and new media course taught at Cherokee High School has resulted in a majority female enrollment for the last four years. Our work on the grant resulted in 5 peer-reviewed papers and presentations, 7 panels or presentations, and 4 gallery shows.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Reiser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323610/1323610_10278023_1515367191699_IMG_7017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323610/1323610_10278023_1515367191699_IMG_7017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"pTOT Project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323610/1323610_10278023_1515367191699_IMG_7017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"pTOT Project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Personal Internet of Things project developed for 2016 workshop at UNC Asheville.
