 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transfer of carbon, nutrients, and pollutants from terrestrial environments to streams and the biogeochemical transformations of these constituents within river networks are issues that motivate environmental scientists and water-resource managers. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a master variable in streams and rivers that affects contaminant speciation and mobility, light penetration, stream metabolism, pH, and water-treatment efficiency. The goals of this study are to (i) improve approaches for predicting DOM pulses from head-water catchments and (ii) advance understanding of factors that consume and alter DOM during its transit through the downstream drainage network.  The project will continue to refine a new model suitable for quantifying DOM transfer from the landscape to streams draining head-water catchments. This model links rainfall-runoff processes that generate stream flow to biogeochemical processes that govern the quantity and composition of terrestrial DOC through changes in catchment-water storage. The model will be tested against measurements of DOM concentration and composition made in several headwater (1st-order) streams of Connecticut's Farmington River Basin. These DOM measurements will also be made in 2nd and 5th-order streams within the Farmington Basin, thereby illuminating the manner in which DOM composition and lability evolve along the drainage network. These observations will be used to test hypotheses for river-network DOM dynamics that are based alternatively on the classical River Continuum concept and a newly proposed Pulse-Shunt concept.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide graduate students and a post-doctoral associate with opportunities to engage meaningfully in lab, field, and quantitative, theoretical research. Equally important, our study will impact the general public by working with the Peabody Museum of Natural History. In particular we will work with New Haven Public high school students to build a \"Watershed Teaching Cart\" that will be manned by high school students on weekends at the Peabody Museum.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report\n\nThe goal of the NSF project \"The Pulse-Shunt Hypothesis: Predicting the Evolution of DOM Composition and DOM Subsidies in Drainage Networks\" is to understand how terrestrial organic compounds influence the water chemistry of downstream ecosystems.  Namely, how dissolved organic matter, or DOM, which moves off of land with storms impacts streams, rivers and ultimately the coastal ocean.   Dissolved organic matter is important to the chemistry of these aquatic systems.  It absorbs light, carries pollutants, and is a main food source for bacteria.  It also reacts with chlorine, during drinking water disinfection, to create hazardous compounds and is regulated in the United States and abroad. \n\nThis project set up an unprecedented set of \"nested\" field sites.  Tiny headwater streams that were nested inside of small rivers, which were themselves nested in bigger rivers.  All sites were outfitted with probe systems to take measurements every 15 minutes.  Automatic samplers were also deployed to take a physical water sample every few hours during storms. These samples were then brought back to the lab to help calibrate the probe systems, but also to provide more in-depth measurements on water quality.  This project was ultimately combined with a larger 5 year grant from the NSF MacroSystems program so the measurements are still ongoing. \n\n             The Pulse-Shunt-Concept has now been published in a leading ecological journal.  It lays out a theoretical basis, backed by a mathematical model, for understanding how the terrestrial transfer of materials responds to storms.    It quantifies the importance of storms and also postulates that large rivers are important sites for the breakdown of terrestrial compounds.  This theoretical work is being tested by data coming back from the probe and laboratory measurements.  One such study examines the data from the Connecticut River, the largest river in our nested design.  It finds that the terrestrial DOM signal can be clearly seen in the probe system in this large river.  Furthermore the best predictor of the DOM response in this large river, was the soil temperature of the watershed.  Thus, in addition to the increased knowledge on the controls of the export of DOM this project was able to demonstrate the utility of this new probe system for large rivers and the land-ocean connection. \n\n             As part of the project we have also been partnering with the Connecticut River Watershed Councils citizen science program.  This program is aimed at taking a snapshot of the entire watersheds nutrient chemistry during a signal day.  A Yale team formed and added Connecticut to the sampling, prior it was just New Hampshire and VT, and added DOM to the sampling, prior it was only nitrogen species.  Furthermore we began a partnership with the Metropolitan District of CT, the water utility for Hartford and its surrounding communities.  In order to understand how reservoirs impact water quality our sampling now includes streams that are the fresh water source for these reservoirs as well as the reservoirs themselves.  \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Raymond"
