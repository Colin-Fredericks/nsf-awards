 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nIII-V semiconductors, such as GaAs, InP, InAs and InSb, are used in laser diodes, photodetectors, fast electronic circuits and the most efficient solar cells. However, very limited attention has been paid to development of solution-processed forms of III-V semiconductors for low-cost manufacturing of this important class of materials and making it accessible to broad markets of energy-related technologies. \r\nThe research supported by the NSF Solid State and Materials Chemistry program focuses on new synthetic and surface chemistry for III-V nanomaterials. It will explore novel approaches to colloidal synthesis of III-V semiconductor nanocrystals. Special attention will be paid to development of new inorganic surface ligands for III-V nanostructures based on molecular metal chalcogenide complexes and pnictide Zintl ions. The combination of strong quantum confinement and new inorganic surface chemistry can lead to new physics due to the multi-valley band structure of III-V semiconductors and due to emergence of the collective electronic states (minibands) in strongly coupled nanocrystal assemblies; it may also lead to new applications for this important class of semiconductors. \r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe fastest commercial transistors and the most efficient solar cells use III-V semiconductors such as GaAs. At the same time technological difficulties associated with preparation and handling III-V semiconductors do not allow them to compete with silicon and other less expensive materials for large consumer markets. This project supported by the NSF Solid State and Materials Chemistry program focuses on development of new soluble forms of III-V semiconductors for low-cost manufacturing of new materials for applications in green energy technologies. The proposed research will create a new class of inexpensive semiconductors suitable for applications in electronics, light-emitting devices and solar cells. Research program will also involve participation of underrepresented minority groups and public outreach to the south side Chicago community. These activities will help recruit minorities and disadvantaged students and promote their pursuit of careers in science and engineering.",
