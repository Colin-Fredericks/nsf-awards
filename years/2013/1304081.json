  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has yielded new computational techniques that will allow for more accurate simulation of physical phenomena in less time.  Two such techniques better simulate how a physical interface moves with and reacts to the surrounding environment.  When these techniques are combined, they enable the simulation of cell membranes undergoing various drying processes that biologists will use to guide the development of lyopreservation methods. These methods, unlike cryopreservation, do not require extremely cold temperatures.  Another technique that resulted from the project will allow mechanical and civil engineers simulate the flow of fluid, such as oil in a pipe, at a fraction of the computational cost.  A final technique produced by the project allows for the simulation of the ocean both during and after an earthquake.  When an earthquake occurs under the seafloor, a tsunami is usually generated that can have devastating effects on coastline populations.  Monitoring instrumentation and early warning systems are currently designed to detect tsunamis that were created far away.  The results of this project will now enable simulation of tsunamis resulting from earthquakes close to the US coastline. These simulations will help provide warning system with better, more tailored instrumentation.\n\nThe project has also contributed to ensuring the next generation of scientists will have the mathematical and computational backgrounds needed to tackle today's problems.
