 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical methods are taught by many engineering disciplines throughout the nation and therefore more engaging and effective teaching of these methods could result in better prepared engineering graduates.  When teaching numerical methods it is critical to cover not only theoretical concepts required for algorithm development and selection but also the precise language of computer programming required for algorithm implementation.  This project is evaluating the efficacy of using an inverted classroom methodology to teach these diverse concepts.  \r\n\r\nResults from this project will include on-line materials that encourage and support use of active in-class pedagogical methods and assessments of these materials and methods. These results will inform the education community regarding the efficacy of teaching numerical methods using an Inverted classroom methodology.  The materials will be readily available to engineering departments nationally and assessment results will help faculty better understand what aspects of numerical methods can be taught using an inverted methodology and also will give them the resources needed to teach in similar ways.  \r\n\r\nMultiple universities with diverse student populations are implementing the methods and materials of this project.  Assessment and evaluation is performed by another university not affiliated with the implementers; therefore, evaluation is independent of the instructors.  Evaluation of student performance is partially being assessed using a numerical methods concept inventory which is being developed by the program.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful results in this research could transform the way engineering programs teach numerical methods nationally.",
