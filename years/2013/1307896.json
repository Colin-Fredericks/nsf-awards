 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is about extending the methods that the PI and his coauthors (M. A. Hill and M. J. Hopkins) developed and used to establish the nonexistence of elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres with Kervaire invariant one, thereby solving a 50 year old problem in algebraic topology.  The conclusion of their main theorem is the opposite of what experts in the field were hoping for in 1970s.  For this reason the theorem raises as many questions as it answers.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic topology is a collection of tools for studying problems in higher dimensional geometry.   While the ideas are abstract, they have helped scientists understand the characteristics of electrons and other elementary particles and provided ideas used a few years ago to solve one of mathematics' most challenging problems, Fermat's Last Theorem. It is useful for understanding knots and robotics. Physicists use algebraic topology to try to figure out the shape of the universe. It helps them understand what they can observe and gives them tools to imagine what they cannot observe. Its ideas are also central to \"string theory,\" where physicists conceive of space as having not just three dimensions but 10 or even more.   Topology gives us a way to deal with 10-dimensional objects without actually seeing and touching them.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic topology is a branch of mathematics with applications to physics and data science.  It gives us powerful  tools for dealing with higher dimensionsal geometry and higher dimensional symmetry. \n\nIn 2009 the PI, along with Mike Hill of UCLA and Mike Hopkins of Harvard, unexpectedly (to us) found the answer to a 50 year old question in the subject known as the Kervaire invariant problem. Our solution made heavy use of techniques involving symmetry, known within the field as equivariant stable homotopy theory.  This was surprising because the problem was not originally conceived in such terms.\n\nThe answer we found was surprising for another reason. The problem has to do with the possible existence of higher dimensional manifolds having certain very delicate properties. It has been known since 1969 that they can only exist in dimensions two less than a power of two Since 1984 it has has also been known that the first five of them (in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30 and 62) do exist.  In the 1970s many topologists tried and failed to construct them in all such dimensions. \n\nWe now know why they failed, because we proved such structures do NOT exist in dimensions 254 and higher.  The case of dimension 126 is still open and very challenging.  It is conceivable that our methods could be refined to show that this sixth object also does not exist, or that some entirely different methods could show that it does.  This is the subject of ongoing research.\n\nThis nonexistence result is the opposite of what most experts were hoping for.  Its full ramifications are still far from being understood.\n\nThis breakthrough has led to increased interest in equivariant methods among both experts and graduate students.  It indicates that such methods can provide insight into geometric problems appearing at first glance not to involve any kind of symmetry.\n\nThe PI is writing a book designed to make these methods more accessible.  The manuscript now has over 600 pages and is still growing.  Stay tuned.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas C Ravenel"
