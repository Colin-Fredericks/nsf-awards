 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program is providing a 10-week summer experience in engineering education research to a group of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduate students recruited from across the nation.  Each summer, eight REU students are working closely with faculty members and their graduate students in the Department of Engineering Education at Utah State University on four research projects that focus on self-regulated learning in engineering education.  Self-regulated learning refers to learners' ability and skills to understand and control their learning environment.  Example projects on which REU students are working include: 1) development of a self-regulation survey instrument for problem solving in engineering, and 2) effect of computer simulation and animation on students' motivation, self-regulating, and cognitive strategies in a foundational engineering course.  REU students are also attending a series of workshops offered by faculty mentors.  The workshop topics include self-regulation learning and its role in engineering education, responsible research, development of research questions, mixed methods research methodologies, and educational data analysis.  Assessment data is being collected to determine whether REU students and their faculty mentors are better off because of this Site program. The results of this Site program are being disseminated in a variety of ways, such as conference presentations and journal publications. This REU Site program acts as a catalyst for undergraduates to retain in STEM careers, particularly careers in teaching and STEM education research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDisclaimer\n\nThis Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nSelf-regulated learning (SRL) refers to a student?s ability to understand and control his/her environment.  Extensive research has shown that SRL significantly affects a student?s academic performance, because it enables students to learn in the most efficient and effective way. It also allows students to make timely corrections and adjustments to improve learning outcomes.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program aims to conduct research on SRL and to motivate and retain talented undergraduates in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) careers. This REU program particularly promotes careers in teaching and research on STEM education. \n\nOver a three-year project period, 24 REU students from across the country actively participated in this REU program, and researched self-regulated learning in the field of engineering education.  During the three-year project period, eight students were selected each year, through a competitive process, to participate in the 10-week REU program. The program was held during the summer on the campus of Utah State University.  Two REU students, a faculty mentor, and a graduate student mentor formed a REU team and worked on a research project.\n\nThis 10-week REU program included four integrated components: REU research projects, workshop and seminar series, dissemination of research findings and program results, and off-campus social and recreational activities.  Throughout this summer program, REU students worked with their faculty and graduate student mentors on a variety of research projects, and learned how to conduct engineering education research.  They also attended workshops and seminars during the early weeks of the program, and presented their research findings in a final symposium held at the end of the program.  \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis REU Site program acts as a catalyst for undergraduates to retain STEM careers, particularly those in teaching and STEM education research.  The 24 past REU students consisted of 16 females and 8 males.  Female students, who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM, accounted for two-thirds (66.7%) of all REU students.  By engaging these students, who are the future STEM workforce, in rigorous and authentic research, this REU program provides a significant number of training opportunities.\n\nThe project results have been disseminated via journal publications, as well as oral and poster presentations at relevant professional conferences, such as the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference &amp; Exposition and the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference.  The research findings from the REU program help improve the understanding of how self-regulated learning plays an important role in the STEM education and engineering education. \n\nIn addition, the research findings from this program provide valuable guidance for STEM education.  Self-regulated learning emphasizes students? planning, self-monitoring, and control of their learning process.  Based on the research findings from the REU program, the instructor can encourage and teach students to adopt effective self-regulated learning strategies, which improves the quality of student learning both inside and outside the classroom.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ning Fang"
