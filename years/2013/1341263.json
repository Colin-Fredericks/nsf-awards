This conference series brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in the theoretical, computational and applied aspects of high-order and spectral methods for the solution of differential equations impacting increasingly diverse and important applications. Subjects of the meeting include, but are not limited to spectral methods, high-order finite difference methods, p- and h-p type finite element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, ENO/WENO methods, high order methods for integral equations, wavelet-based methods, stochastic methods, efficient solvers and preconditioners for high order methods, efficient time-stepping methods, as well as computational aspects for modern hardware environments. The format of the meeting includes both invited papers as well as submitted contributions in order to encourage wider participation especially from young scientists and under-represented minorities. Target of funding to women and minorities facilitates their engagement in this important field of computational mathematics. \r\n\r\nThis NSF grant provides funds in support of the International Conference on Spectral and High Order Methods which will be held in June 2014, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The conference engages a broad group of researchers at all career stages representing the mathematical sciences and engineering, as well as practitioners from multiple industrial and government communities, with research interests impacting a number of important scientific domains. These include topics such as aeroacoustics, bioengineering, electromagnetics, ocean and climate modeling, seismology, turbulent flows, non-Newtonian flows, nonlinear optics, plasma dynamics, image processing and uncertainty quantification.  The format of this moderately-sized conference provides an opportunity for networking and career advancement for junior academics. NSF funding is targeted to provide fellowships for minorities and women, particularly those who are at early career levels and facilitates their exposure to important application areas for research.",
