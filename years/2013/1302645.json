 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study and develop technology for Elastic Optical Networks (EONs).   In EONs flexible amounts of spectral bandwidth may be allocated to each data channel without requiring adherence to a fixed wavelength grid. Such an approach is well-suited for supporting a wide range of dynamic traffic demands in a bandwidth-efficient manner.  Key enabling technologies, optical arbitrary waveform generation\r\n(OAWG) and optical arbitrary waveform measurement (OAWM), will enable elastic optical networking over a large spectrum by dividing the spectrum into spectral slices and dynamically processing information at lower rates compatible with CMOS electronics. The project will leverage these technologies as a basis for innovative hardware and software solutions for EON technology, architectures, protocols, network control and management, system integration, and testbed integration.  \r\n\r\nAdvances in the basic architecture and technology for optical networking is important for US competitiveness.   The project will work with several US-based industrial organizations as a means of technology transfer.  The research results and publications will likely to impact standardization activities of flexible grid networking (e.g. International Telecommunication Union ITU-T SG15 on flex grid).   The project will link education and research and serve as a rich platform for crossdisciplinary education in optical and higher-layer networking, and in computer engineering.",
