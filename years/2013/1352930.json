This event struck the lower end of the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone, at a depth of >600 km.   Continuous monitoring of the postseismic deformation caused by the earthquake will provide valuable data for the understanding of mantle rheologic properties and subduction processes of the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone.  \r\n\r\n***",
