 "awd_abstract_narration": "1359025\r\nKlewicki\r\n\r\nThe past decade has seen transformational advances in turbulence experimentation and simulation, and these have allowed the unprecedented capability to study the detailed temporal and spatial structure of turbulent boundary layers. Furthermore, recently developed facilities and sensors around the globe are now allowing access to turbulence structure at significantly higher Reynolds numbers than previously studied. As a result, our understanding of boundary layer dynamics is now progressing at an ever increasing pace. It is timely to review, discuss and advance beyond these developments.  The proposal seeks funds to partially cover expenses related to the organization of a workshop on \"High Reynolds Number Boundary Layer Turbulence: Integrating Descriptions of Statistical Structure, Scaling and Dynamical Evolution\", to be held at the campus of the University of New Hampshire, from November 20-22, 2013. The workshop will be targeted specifically to high Reynolds number turbulence. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nBoundary layer dynamics are pervasive in numerous scientific processes and technologically important applications. For these reasons, the capacity to better predict boundary layer behavior, and especially at high Reynolds numbers, persists as a high value objective. The specific aims of this workshop are to (i) provide an interactive setting where the latest findings of this rapidly advancing field can be presented and discussed at length, and (ii) bring together the established and emerging protagonists of boundary layer research (experts in experiments, simulation and analysis) with a cadre of applied mathematicians who are leaders in advancing the systematic development of reduced order models of complex fluid flows. An overarching aim is to more deeply explore how our new and emerging understandings of boundary layer dynamics can be used to benefit the development of more accurate, computationally efficient and more well-founded models of the high Reynolds number boundary layer.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nBetter understanding of turbulent boundary layers at very high Reynolds numbers will lead to improved understanding of a number of engineering and physics problems, such as aerospace applications, meteorology and weather prediction, pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere and in rivers and oceans, energy production with wind farms, etc. This understanding may also allow the design of fluid transportation systems or vessels that require less energy to operate.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will bring together researchers who work on a number of allied problems, but, in many cases, are not yet natural collaborators. The expertise of the attendees is chosen to cover the disciplinary foci that are deemed to span the elements required to develop and refine the systematic construction of the accurate reduced order models for the high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer; a timely goal that now seems within reach. Given this, the proposed workshop will promote two primary broader impacts. The first is directed toward the formation of a research community whose members have an understanding of the full scope of elements that must rationally be understood if the envisioned modeling paradigm(s) are to be realized. The second is to initiate collaborations amongst the participants, and thus substantively promote the specific areas of inquiry required to advance reduced order model development and implementation. While there will be no formal proceedings of the workshop, the individual presentations will be collected in electronic form, and will subsequently be made available on a public website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant helped to partially support a research workshop entitled, \"High Reynolds number boundary layer turbulence: Integrating descriptions of statistical structure, scaling, and dynamical evolution.\"  This workshop was held at the University of New Hampshire in late November 2013, and included an international cohort of leading researchers.  The primary focus of the workshop was to leverage recent progress in experimentation, computation and analysis toward advancing the next generation of predictive models of the turbulent boundary layer.\n\nFor reference, a turbulent boundary layer is the natural state of sufficiently high speed fluid flow that forms adjacent to a solid surface under the condition that the fluid is flowing tangential to the surface.  These types of flows are pervasive in technological applications, and are of critical importance regarding fossil fuel based energy usage consumption.  Example turbulent boundary layer flows include those over the external surfaces of commercial airliners and nuclear submarines, as well as the flow internal to oil pipelines.  Turbulent boundary layers are very difficult to study and dynamically characterize because these flows are both spatially and temporally chaotic, while the overall flow structure is highly anisotropic. \n\nOver the past decade, transformational advances in experimentation and simulation have ushered in the capacity to characterize the detailed structure of turbulent boundary layers, while recently developed facilities and sensors are now allowing access to turbulence structure at significantly higher Reynolds numbers.  As a result, the understanding of boundary layer dynamics is now advancing at an ever increasing pace.  These conditons set the context and justification for the subject workshop.\n\nThe goals of the workshop were to (i) provide a setting where the latest findings of this rapidly advancing field can be discussed in detail by (ii) the emerging and established protagonists of boundary layer research (experts in experiments, simulation, and analysis) with (ii) a cadre of applid mathematicians who are advancing the development of well-founded reduced-order models of complex fluid phenomena.  An overarching aim was to develop collaborations and explore how our new and emerging understanding can be leveraged to develop more accurate and more well-founded models of boundary layer dynamics.\n\nBased upon the feedback from the participants, the workshop was an unambiguous success, and clearly advanced its stated aims.  In fact, there have been numerous calls for a follow-on workshop.  Primary outcomes from the workshop include (i) the dissemination of the workshop presentations on the UNH Integrated Applied Mathematics (IAM) Program website, (ii) the subsequent establishment of a number of collaborations, and (iii) the inspiration of at least three UNH undergraduate students to pursue advanced degrees in the areas of fluid dynamics and turbulence.  These students are now pursuing their PhD degrees at the University of Minnesota, University of Colorado and University of Melbourne.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph C Klewicki"
