The MWDS is one of the country's longest running and most influential analysis conference series: it has been in existence for over forty years, the last twenty-two with NSF support. The MWDS has  positively affected the careers of several generations of mathematicians. It is not possible to tabulate the number of mathematical papers that have resulted from the interactions that the event has fostered. The MDWS meets annually at venues all around the country, but primarily at locations in the Midwest.\r\n\r\nAmong the many long-standing, recurring mathematical conferences in the US, the MWDS stands out as a model of successful efforts to ensure diversity and broaden participation. From its inception the MWDS has displayed as one of its hallmarks the inclusion of women, young mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups. This will not change with the current award: the bulk of the forty individuals who will receive support for any meeting of the MWDS will be women and young mathematicians (graduate students, postdocs, untenured assistant professors).",
