The conference will be held at the University of New England, Biddeford, ME from June 16-21, 2013. Liquid crystal science has played a significant role in many basic and applied fields, including physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. Composed of anisotropic organic and biological molecules, liquid crystals interact with external fields and surfaces to influence strongly their orientational order, structure and properties. From the basic perspective, the orientational order and collective molecular behavior are central contributions to the biological science of self-assembly of membranes, to the dynamics of tissues and muscles activities, and to DNA assemblies. The extraordinary values and contributions of liquid crystals to the modern photonic and information display technologies have revolutionized the way we visualize and present information in so-called information displays, ranging from mobile to projection devices, flat panel TVs to 3D displays, and eco-friendly e-papers. The GRC on LCs will focus on their role in self-assembly, nanoscience, and biotechnology. The conference will address the most important current themes in liquid crystals presented by the world's leading scientists in the fields of biomedical science, engineering, and nanotechnology. \r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Gordon Conference on Liquid Crystals will provide participants with a unique forum to disclose unpublished data, deliberate and challenge novel ideas outside the realm of accepted thought, and ultimately push outward the frontiers of science and innovation for a particular field. The meeting will provide a forum for career networking and career advancement and will support and encourage young scientists and graduate students as they take their first steps in the vibrant and intrinsically interdisciplinary research field of liquid crystals, helping them establish initial scientific and personal contacts. As a part of the outreach activities of the Conference, the funding will be used to support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior scientists from underrepresented groups and enable the opportunity to build networks of friends and mentors and to forge long-term professional contacts. Ten women and minority speakers/discussion leaders are included in the preliminary program.",
