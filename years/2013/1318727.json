 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project extends deformation rate estimates for the Death Valley-Fish Lake Valley transcurrent fault system, western Great Basin, to the last 5 million years with a stepwise resolution of 100,000 and possibly 10,000 years. The work will focus on a major restraining bend in the Death Valley-Fish Lake Valley fault system that formed as lateral displacement along the Death Valley-Fish Lake Valley fault was transferred to local shortening and uplift. The primary objectives are: (1) determination of deformation rates; (2) assessment of the role of discrete versus distributed deformation mechanisms; and (3) characterization of the three-dimensional geometry and evolution of structures and possible vertical-axis rotation during formation of the restraining bend. The project involves integration of detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, stratigraphic characterization, geochronology, and magnetostratigraphic-paleomagnetic analysis. Field and laboratory studies will define the three-dimensional geometry, tectonic evolution, and mechanisms of deformation active during the formation of this major contractional structure. Assessment of deformation rates over different time intervals utilizes a robust chronostratigraphic framework and determination of aggregate and incremental displacements from deformation models. By combining high-precision 40Ar/39Ar age data for numerous key stratigraphic intervals (e.g. specific tephra layers and volcaniclastic deposits) with a magnetic polarity stratigraphy that can be correlated with the astrochronologically-tuned Neogene geomagnetic polarity timescale, temporal resolutions of 100,000 and possibly 10,000 years will be obtained. Combining this temporal information with field relations involving synorogenic strata and three-dimensional structural models allows resolution of incremental displacements of 100 to 1,000 meters during growth of the structure. With these displacement and timing ranges, the displacement and growth of the restraining bend provides rate determinations comparable to those for late Quaternary surface displacements.\r\n\r\nAccurate estimates of the rates of a broad range of geologic processes are critical to understanding the evolution of the Earth's surface over different time scales. The deformation of continents through the formation of faults and the release of seismic energy as earthquakes, in what is known as the earthquake cycle, is becoming better understood over durations of tens to tens of thousands of years and such information provides important insights into whether or to what degree earthquake activity remains the same through geologic time. Unfortunately, the ability to estimate deformation rates on major fault systems becomes more poorly resolved with the passage of time, mainly due to the obscuring effects of younger deformation and the inability to measure offset of well-dated marker units across faults. The capacity to estimate deformation rates over durations of tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years in most parts of the world remains elusive for periods of geologic time ranging from hundreds of thousands and millions of years. Enhanced understanding the earthquake cycle over durations of millions of years requires unraveling Earth's history over different time scales, and can be addressed only in rare instances where geologic structures are well preserved and provide the capacity to date geologic events with high- precision. The anticipated results of this research project will quantify the progressive development of a part of a major geologic fault system exposed within the broad, currently seismically active region that is the boundary between the eastern Sierra Nevada and the western Great Basin in the western US Cordillera. The Death Valley-Fish Lake Valley fault system has been active for several millions of years and records tens of kilometers of horizontal displacement. When compared to well determined contemporary and latest Quaternary deformation rate estimates established geodetically and from offset geomorphic features, the results of this study will help tie active tectonic to long-term deformation processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe western United States is a spectacular natural laboratory for the study of how a major, large-area oceanic plate (ocean lithosphere) has and continues to interact with the North American continent.  At present, and over the past 25+ million years (Ma), this interaction has been oblique, rather than ?head-on? and has resulted in the formation of the major, active San Andreas fault system along the western margin of California, where crust to the west of the fault system is being displaced progressively northward (largely in a horizontal direction) relative to North America (right-lateral sense).  Notably, similar fault systems have been active farther inboard of the margin of western North America, and several workers have in fact hypothesized that in the near geologic future, the Sierra Nevada and adjacent areas will begin to drift to the northwest away from North America.  The northwest-trending Furnace Creek-Fish Lake Valley fault system lies east of the Sierra Nevada (in easternmost California and western Nevada) and contains the record of a long history of some 45 to 50 km of right-lateral sense displacement since its inception about 15 Ma ago.  Geologic mapping and numerical age determinations (argon isotope geochronology) obtained through two US geochronology laboratories show that some 22 km of offset occurred from about 12 to about 4 Ma, with a long term average displacement rate of 2.9 mm/yr.  Observations made during this project have been interpreted to suggest that a transition to a style of deformation where a combination of extension (to the west-northwest) and right-lateral horizontal displacement is recorded along the Furnace Creek-Fish Lake Valley fault zone beginning about 4 Ma and is associated with a higher right-lateral displacement rate (long-term average of about 5.7 to 7 mm/yr).  The total magnitude of right-lateral displacement and also the slip rates for the time interval after about 4 Ma appear to decrease from south to north along the Fish Lake Valley part of the fault zone and these phenomena are interpreted to reflect the contemporaneous displacement ?transfer? onto another, linked and similar fault system to the east and north, referred to as the Walker Lane.  Geologic mapping by several students involved in the project and structural and stratigraphic analysis in the Cucomungo Canyon area as well as modeling of considerable gravity data obtained in this project allow a better understanding of the subsurface architecture of Fish Lake Valley and nearby valleys and place constraints on the displacement history for the region.  The gravity data are interpreted to indicate that Fish Lake Valley is internally dissected by a system of faults that divide the subsurface into multiple sub-basins with depths of about 1.8 to over 3 km, and that these basis are filled with volcanic and sedimentary deposits ranging in age from about 16 Ma to essentially the present.  The gravity data in concert with geologic mapping and subsurface data in northern Fish Lake Valley (compiled by one of the PhD students involved in the project) reveal the internal distribution of basin filling deposits and allow for the estimation of displacement on basin bounding faults since about 4 Ma.  Diagnostic rock sequences mapped in bedrock exposures adjacent to the valley and inferred in the subsurface indicate that about 4 to 5.5 kilometers of vertical offset has accumulated on faults bounding and within southern and central Fish Lake Valley, and about 3.6 km of vertical offset has taken place along structures bounding the northeast Fish Lake Valley since the about 4 Ma.  About 2 to 3 km of right-lateral displacement has been transferred from the Fish Lake Valley fault zone to structures bounding the northeast Fish Lake Valley in the last 4 Ma.  These results are consistent with previous investigations in the general area and indicate that of the about 23 to 28 km of total right-lateral displacement that accumulated on the Fish Lake Valley fault zone since about 4 Ma, about 10 km of this displacement has been transferred away to a linked and similar fault system to the east of the Fish Lake Valley fault zone (southern part of the Walker Lane).  The remaining displacement is likely transferred to the north and west via an array of numerous parallel faults, each with lesser displacement, both within and west of the Volcanic Hills, and underlying northwest Fish Lake Valley.  If the structural evolution of this area over the past several Ma is a key to the future, the eastern Sierra Nevada and western Great Basin will likely continue to be a tectonically active area.  Eight graduate students (three PhD and five MS students) directly or indirectly were involved in this research and all of them successfully completed their dissertations/theses in 2018.  Images related to this research project can be found in the student dissertations/theses, available through the University of Texas at Dallas library system. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Geissman"
