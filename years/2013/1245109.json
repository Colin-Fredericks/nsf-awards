 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses mobile app development in required, inquiry-based general education courses to increase the number of non-STEM and undeclared major students who see technology as a career objective. Through this exposure as technology creators rather than just as consumers, it is hoped that students will develop an interest in pursuing more STEM courses and majors. The project is developing a series of mobile app courses and is also training faculty on how to include these concepts into a number of other general education courses. While university freshmen, transfer students, and students at risk of leaving the university are the primary audience for the courses, rising junior and senior students at local high schools as well as students at Northern Virginia Community College have access to the mobile app development courses through Marymount's summer institute.\r\n\r\nA particular focus and strength of the project is formal assessment of student: learning gains, interest in technology, confidence with technology, and attention to increases in the number of STEM majors at the university after introduction of the mobile app development courses and concepts. The outcomes of this research could contribute to a foundation for understanding the degree to which the engagement with mobile app development affects students' interest, persistence, and learning gains in STEM, computing, and IT majors and careers. In addition to faculty training workshops, the project's progress and results are available through the project website and at local, regional, and national conferences.",
