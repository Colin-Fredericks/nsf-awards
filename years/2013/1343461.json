 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the science and technology of unique multifunctional ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) film (coating) technology into superior energy storage cells and solutions that fill the performance, life-cycle, and production readiness gap evident in conventional battery applications. The collective goal is to produce a commercially viable path to the next generation of Li-ion batteries (LIB) and a new generation of thermal Li-Sulfur (TLS) batteries.  The translated science and technology of UNCD-based LIB and TLS have the following unique features: i) high performance anodes based on electrically conductive UNCD-coated metal anodes to increase the battery lifetime by at least 10x with respect to current technologies, ii) UNCD-based membranes for Li+ ions transport with at least 10x higher resistance to battery environmental and chemical attacks than for current batteries, and iii) UNCD films as extremely chemically resistant coatings for the battery inner walls case to substantially lower the cost, extend cells' life-cycle, and improve the economic viability of the end product. Currently, much more expensive metals would be required to survive the targeted x10 longer life time (given exposure to the harsh environment of the LIB and TLS batteries). This PFI AIR project intends to deliver a TLS battery that has a potential volumetric energy density of 2,600 Wh/l with a theoretical specific energy density of 2,500 Wh/kg, which is at least x10 superior performance to current battery technologies. The state-of-the-art for cathodes and anodes (two critical components) for this couple currently features a theoretical volumetric energy density of 2,125 Wh/l and a theoretical specific energy density of 597 Wh/kg. The resulting TLS approach will provide 22% improvement in volumetric energy density and ~400% improvement in specific energy density over existing secondary LIB technologies, when compared to the leading competing LIB science/technology from manufacturers in this market space.  \r\nThe project accomplishes its objectives by developing: i)  boron-doped UNCD (B-UNCD) and nitrogen-grain boundary incorporated (N-UNCD) coated metallic electrodes (e.g, tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), or W-coated Cu) to determine which is the best anode material to insert in the new generation of LIB and TLS batteries, ii) the best approach between a patented chemical etching processes from Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT) and UNCD-coated Si-based or anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes used as templates to produce 10x more chemically robust UNCD-based membranes than current battery membranes, and iii) chemically resistant UNCD coating for the inner walls of the battery metal case to make it possible to use a less expensive metal material as opposed to currently used  molybdenum that is both expensive and chemically less resistant. A prototype coin-type battery will be demonstrated as a proof-of-concept of the novel UNCD-based LIB and TLS battery technologies for defibrillators/pacemakers, cell phones, and computers. The new UNCD-based battery technology will be scalable to produce larger batteries for larger systems such as car batteries. \r\nThe partnership engages researchers from the University of Texas at Dallas (Materials Science and Engineering Department), who will provide N-UNCD coatings for the battery anodes and UNCD-coated membranes based on the Si and AAO templates. The industrial and commercialization partner is Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT), a company currently expanding the commercial application of thin smooth diamond. ADT will provide the expertise for developing the B-UNCD films as alternative electrically conductive coatings for battery anodes, as described above. In addition, ADT will provide expertise on customer identification, engagement and commercialization, as well as manage production of the diamond coated battery components (pre-integration) and public introduction of the first LIB/TLS batteries in the market. The infrastructure is already in place in ADT facilities to translate the UNCD coating science/technology along a path that will result in a competitive commercial reality for a new generation of LIB and TLS batteries with potentially 10x better performance than current batteries.  \r\nThe potential economic impact includes domestic production of high energy density cells expected to become viable in the next five years, and will re-engage the US as a competitive fixture in the batteries market space with key, targeted market segments in medical devices/systems, mobile communication devices, computers and many other systems requiring long life low cost batteries.   The societal impact, long term, will be in the form of i) at least 10x smaller/longer life for medical implants (i.e., defibrillators/pacemakers), which will impact positively the quality of life of people requiring these devices, and ii) longer life/smaller batteries to power more efficient cell phones, portable computers, and other electronic devices.",
