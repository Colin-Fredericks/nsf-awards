 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transforming Developmental Mathematics Education in Partnership with Teacher Preparation targets students in developmental mathematics courses (DMCs) while strengthening preparation of prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs). Almost 40% of U.S. undergraduates take at least one DMC (Attewell et al., 2006). Increasingly, technologies like adaptive web-based tutoring systems are used to teach DMCs. Research shows, however, that methods supporting student collaboration are essential for student success in DMCs (Hodera, 2011). This project implements and evaluates a hybrid structure where PSMTs teach DMCs, testing the hypothesis that students enrolled in DMCs, taught using research-based materials and methods, perform better on measures of mathematical proficiency than students not in such classes. \r\n\r\nA core feature is that PSMTs, mentored by experienced mathematics educators and using research-based materials and methods, assume responsibility for teaching sections of a DMC. Measures to assess the efficacy of this model include: pre-and post-assessments of students' mathematical proficiency; surveys and interviews soliciting students' interest and self-efficacy in mathematics; video records of PSMTs' instruction, self-reflections about their teaching, and interviews about learning to teach through this experience.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this project are two-fold: 1) contribution to the scant literature on hybrid structures that maximize the potential of web-based, adaptive tutoring with face-to-face instruction in DMCs; and 2) development of materials for DMCs that provide guidance to instructors for implementing the instructional model. As a result of disseminating these materials, broader impacts include improved outcomes for under-represented groups, increased STEM participation, and contributions to a teaching force better prepared to teach students who have struggled in mathematics.",
