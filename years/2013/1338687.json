 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to being taught that engineering practice requires assuming liability for the direct performance of one's designs; students must also be trained to consider the ethical dimensions of their indirect obligations and liabilities. The indirect effects of a product, project, or policy can be characterized and quantified using life cycle assessment (LCA), which is a formal modeling method that utilizes a comprehensive \"cradle-to-grave\" approach to evaluate environmental and social impacts.  LCA is in wide use by designers, scientists and engineers, and businesses, primarily for use in product design and management, and is also employed in policy spheres to quantify the systemic impacts of large-scale engineering and technology decisions. While the use of LCA is widespread, the modeling structure and the interpretation of results involve ethical and value judgments that must be navigated carefully both by the analyst and by the receiver of the results.  This EESE project centers on the integration of ethical training into life cycle courses and the development of life cycle-based educational materials for general ethics training in engineering and science. Hypothetical and real-world cases are being developed that address a range of life cycle-oriented ethical challenges, with relevance for multiple disciplines. Instructional materials and video footage presenting each case, as well as shorter versions for younger audiences, are also being created and hosted at the Northeastern Ethics Institute as an additional teaching resource. Case studies are being submitted to ethics, engineering, science, policy, and business case study clearinghouses as well as additional dissemination through structured tutorials at national and international conferences.  One of these case studies is being converted into a three-hour workshop format at the University of Notre Dame and offered subsequently at one of its HBCU partner institutions.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to achieve broad impacts inside and outside of the classroom. Most importantly, this project directly affects the professional development of students who will carry the insights, perspectives, and behaviors instilled by this ethics training into the workforce, to the ultimate benefit of society. The cases developed address fundamental ethical principles and macroethical issues; they will therefore be of value for ethics education in the engineering classroom even at universities without existing courses in LCA or science policy, including those who have adopted a workshop approach to graduate-level ethics education. Under-represented groups are being included both as participants on the project team and in several case-based ethics workshops. While the full cases are being designed for university students, shorter versions for secondary school students raise awareness of life cycle issues and environmental ethics early in formal STEM education.  Ultimately, this project advances ethics education for a diverse range of students in a way that reflects 21st century progress toward sustainable engineering and technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEngineers, business professionals, and public servants shape our nation?s physical and social infrastructure through the decisions that they make.  It is vital that they be trained to think broadly and critically about the societal and environmental implications of their work.  In support of this goal, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology requires that all accredited engineering programs in the United States train their students to have an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.  \n\n \n\nThis NSF-funded project developed next-generation ethics education materials that can be used in a wide range of classroom settings.  The interdisciplinary project team at Northeastern created seven in-depth case studies, based on interviews and original analysis, to highlight the ethics dimensions of real-world decisions taken in engineering, management, and public policy.  Traditional ethics training in these disciplines tends to focus on whether or not a certain decision is strictly legal.  These new case studies move far beyond such narrow professional questions, and instead demonstrate how decisions can be made that consider larger impacts to society and the environment as a whole, using a so-called life-cycle perspective.\n\n \n\nThe case studies cover a range of fields and topics, specifically: metals used in electronics, nanomaterials used in food, plant-based materials used in plastics, industrial waste management, battery take-back programs, and drug disposal in hospitals.  Each case is accompanied by instructor notes and discussion questions.  An ethics ?primer? was also created that introduces basic ethics concepts and definitions in a manner that is tailored to students of professional fields.  In order to maximize the potential for dissemination and use of the case studies they were adapted into several different forms of student engagement, including 1-page worksheets, class debates, and (with project collaborators at University of Notre Dame) a video and role-playing game.  Numerous undergraduate and graduate students, the majority of whom were from groups under-represented in engineering, were involved in researching, writing, and testing the different case studies, enabling their own academic development.\n\n \n\nOver the course of the project, these innovative ethics education materials were delivered to hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students and disseminated to other educators at more than a dozen workshops and conferences.  Student learning was assessed to make sure that educational objectives were being met, using a framework adapted from recommendations of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.  Based on the case study work, the project was designated an Exemplar in Engineering Ethics Education by the National Academy of Engineering, one of 25 chosen from across the nation.  The project will also be included in the forthcoming book Next Generation Ethics: Engineering a Better Society, published by Cambridge University Press.  It is anticipated that all case studies and associated materials will be available to interested educators and students online for free.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Eckelman"
