 "awd_abstract_narration": "1254839 (Clarens)  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to understand the processes that would enable geologic storage of CO2 in fractured shale formations. Two objectives will be pursued to achieve this overarching goal. The first is to study the physicochemical processes, e.g., interfacial properties like wettability and bubble rheology and physical and chemical characteristics like residual trapping and sorption, in multicomponent and multiphase systems containing CO2, brine, minerals, and hydrocarbons. Experimental methods at several spatial scales will be used to test the hypothesis that CO2 can enhance CH4 extraction from low permeability shales and that these formations can be managed as repositories for geological carbon sequestration (GCS). The second objective is to model the systems-level processes driving the industrial ecology of carbon cycling by the oil and gas industry. Life cycle analysis will be used to understand how and when the technology proposed here might be implemented to achieve large-scale climate benefits. Geospatial analysis, scenario development, and multicriteria decision analysis will be used to evaluate the long-term viability of coupled shale gas and GCS deployment. In support of this research effort, the PI will carry out an integrated education project studying novel pedagogical techniques based on the boundary object literature for teaching climate change. The boundary object approach focuses students on common ideas, tools, or frameworks (e.g., schematics or models) that can be used by groups to start dialog, build consensus, and successfully collaborate. This work will make the following contributions to the academic literature: (1) measure the interfacial properties that will govern the reactive transport of CO2 through shales; (2) identify the chemical formulations that would enable the use of CO2-based \"green\" fracturing fluids as substitutes for water-based fluids; and (3) test approaches for \"healing\" shales post extraction using CO2 to minimize the risks of induced seismicity and leakage. These outcomes could help improve well production over time and lead to long term stable repositories for CO2. GCS is attractive because it is proven and could scale large enough to meaningfully reduce worldwide carbon emissions. Systems models of known shale reservoirs will estimate the total sequestration capacity of these formations. This project will build much-needed understanding of how ongoing fuel development will impact climate dynamics and will directly inform the economic and legal  consequences of GCS. This understanding will reduce the uncertainties currently associated with unconventional fuel deployment and with GCS in saline aquifers. Both could have unforeseen environmental, economic, legal, and social impacts if developed improperly. Shale gas and GCS are now poised for broad deployment. Consequently, this work is timely for meeting national greenhouse gas and energy independence objectives. \r\n\r\nIn support of this research effort, the PI will carry out an integrated education project studying novel pedagogical techniques based on the boundary object literature for teaching climate change.

Geologic storage of CO<sub>2</sub> is one promising approach for keeping the CO<sub>2</sub> that is generated at our power plants and industrial facilities out of the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change. Unconventional shale gas wells are made using vertical drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques that help produce a large amount of methane and other hydrocarbons from rocks with very low permeability. Our work sought to understand how the processes that control methane gas transport out of these formation might impact CO<sub>2</sub> formation into the same fracture networks and pores (Figure 1). In principal this would be both less expensive than storing the CO<sub>2</sub> in other geologic formations, because you would not need to drill new wells, and safer, because these formations have stored gases safely for thousands of years, than other forms of geologic storage of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n<p>This project enabled us to explore a variety of fundamental questions related to the ways CO<sub>2</sub> moves through low permeability rocks. We used high-pressure experiments to understand the role that rock properties and chemistry have on fluid flow. We were the first group to show that in many of the smooth mineral surfaces that occur in a fractured shale, you can actually get CO<sub>2</sub> adhesion, where the fluid sticks to the mineral surface, creating a very safe trapping mechanism (Figure 2). We also used microfluidic experiments to explore which parameters; roughness, surface tension, etc. have the greatest impact on multiphase flow through a capillary (Figure 3). These measurements are critical for understanding the ways that water, CO<sub>2</sub> and methane flow through fracture networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant also enabled us to study fundamental chemistry and physics that support the development of engineering applications. For example, our experiments led us to invent novel reactive nanoparticles that can be used to preempt leaks from geologic storage formations. By studying the reaction of mineral silicates (Figure 4) that could be injected during completion of a well, we developed approaches for &lsquo;healing&rsquo; fractured formations at their end of life using CO<sub>2</sub> to seal and cement fractures (Figure 5). We also looked at the effects of using non-aqueous fracturing fluids that would improve methane yields and CO<sub>2</sub> storage. By measuring interfacial tension, contact angle, and other important parameters we were able to model methane production from a representative well if you used CO<sub>2</sub>-based working fluids instead of water.</p>\n<p>To complement our experimental work, we also performed systems-level analysis that confirmed the benefits of moving away from water-based fracturing processes and exploring the long-term potential of using these wells for CO<sub>2</sub> storage. We performed the first life cycle analysis of CO<sub>2</sub>-based fracturing fluids, which showed that current techniques for using water to fracture shales have enormous water, energy, and greenhouse gas burdens and many of these can be offset by using CO<sub>2</sub> as an alternative fracturing fluid (Figure 6). One of the biggest limitations to performing CO<sub>2</sub>-based fracturing involves delivery of CO<sub>2</sub> to the well sites so we performed a network analysis to understand where CO<sub>2</sub> is generated at power plants in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. The study suggests that the costs of storing CO<sub>2</sub> in fractured shale wells would vary considerably based on location but there are many regions where this approach looks cost-competitive for delivering low-carbon power today.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project were to develop an approach for helping people build mental models of climate systems. To achieve this broader impact, we developed a new course entitled &ldquo;CEE 3050: Introduction to Green Engineering&rdquo;, which is a required third-year course at the University of Virginia that challenges students to engage with sustainable energy and climate systems in new ways. The course uses a flipped classroom model and relies on three group projects, one of which is focused on geoengineering and one of which is focused on low carbon cements.
