The centerpieces of the workshop are two mini-courses directed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s: one by Irina Mitrea of Temple University on topics related to the geometry of real-analytic submanifolds of complex spaces, and the other by Bernhard Lamel of the University of Vienna dealing with the interplay of several complex variables with harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
