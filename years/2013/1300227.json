 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Donna Chen and John Monnier will study titania-supported Pt-Re clusters as model systems for developing new catalysts for the conversion of bio-renewable fuels like ethanol to clean H2 for use in fuel cells.  The proposed studies will guide the development of superior Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts by providing fundamental understanding of how surface chemistry is controlled by: bimetallic interactions, reactions occurring at the metal-cluster interface, the activity of oxidized Re, and the dependence of these properties on cluster size.  In addition, the proposed work will provide detailed knowledge of reaction kinetics, mechanisms and the nature of the active sites.  Oxidative reforming of ethanol with O2 and water (autothermal reforming) will be investigated on vapor-deposited Pt, Re, and Pt-Re clusters prepared in ultrahigh vacuum.  Partial oxidation of ethanol and the water-gas shift reaction will be studied on the model catalysts to independently investigate these two reactions, which both occur in autothermal reforming.  The bimetallic cluster surfaces will be fully characterized using techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy, low energy ion scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.  The catalytic activities of the clusters will be investigated using a recirculation loop reactor coupled to the UHV system, and surface intermediates will be studied under catalytic conditions using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. The PIs will train graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of surface science and catalysis, and more importantly in the area of overlap between surface science and catalyst performance. Furthermore, the PIs will actively participate in efforts to promote understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology research in the local community via existing programs at USC.\r\n\r\nMany commercial heterogeneous catalysts consist of bimetallic materials on oxide support surfaces.  This research project will lead to better understanding of how catalytic activity can be tailored through interactions between the two metals and interactions between the metals and the support.  Specifically, this work will contribute to the rational design of platinum and rhenium containing catalysts for the decomposition of renewable biofuels like ethanol to clean hydrogen for use in hydrogen fuel cells.  Furthermore, the PIs will actively participate in efforts to promote understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology research in the local community via existing programs at USC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, the role of bimetallic and metal-support interactions was investigated in order to understand the enchanced activity of Pt-Re catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and methanol oxidation.  In the WGS reaction, catalysts with the highest activity were the ones with Pt at the surface and Re subsurface.  Both experiments and calculations demonstrated that the role of Re is to prevent surface poisoning by CO by decreasing the adsorption strength of CO on Pt.  Notably, Re oxide plays no role in the WGS shift reaction, given that only metallic subsurface Re is detected under reaction conditions.  Since the Pt and Pt-Re catalysts are known to have higher activity when supported on titania, activity was studied for Pt clusters on a carbon support, on Pt(111) itself, and as a function Pt coverage on titania.  The activity per Pt atom was 40% lower on carbon compared with on titania for the pure Pt catalyst, and the activity per Pt atom on Pt(111) was 60% lower than for Pt on titania.  Furthermore, the activity of Pt on titania increased with the number of interfacial Pt-TiO2 sites.  These experiments show that Pt-TiO2 interfacial sites significantly contribute activity in the WGS reaction.  For methanol oxidation reactions, significant compositional changes in the supported Pt-Re clusters were observed under reaction conditions, in contrast to what was observed in the WGS reaction.  Specifically, the presence of oxygen induced diffusion of Re to the surface, where Re formed a voltile Re oxide species, whereas in the WGS reaction, the reactants gases did not change the surface composition of the catalyst.  Educational activities for this project include training of graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the interface of surface science and catalysis.  In addition, hands-on science modules were designed for fifth grade students in conjunction with a local elementary school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donna A Chen"
