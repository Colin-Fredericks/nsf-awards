 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project led by the Exploratorium will use a combination of tracking and timing, cluster analysis, and focus groups to seek to answer the research question: To what extent and in what ways do female-responsive designs more effectively engage girls at STEM exhibits? This project addresses the need for more research in this area by pioneering the study of potential female-responsive design (FRD) principles for exhibits across a wide variety of STEM topics and exhibit types.\r\n\r\nThis project includes four phases that will build from the work of the PI that developed an initial Female-Responsive Design (FRD) Framework regarding female engagement and learning in STEM -- based on extensive literature review and practitioner interviews. This project will expand on and validate this FRD Framework, with the ultimate goal of having a set of criteria for female-responsive designs (FRD) that effectively engage girls at STEM exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe four phases of the research project are:\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Track whole museum visits to identify, which exhibits engage boys and girls equally, and which are less engaging for girls. \r\n\r\nPhase 2: A panel of experts and girl advisors identify additional female-responsive design principles, expanding on those identified to date in literature and practice. \r\n\r\nPhase 3: Combining results from the first two phases, the third phase employs statistical analyses to reveal the most effective combinations of design principles for engaging girls across STEM topics and exhibit types. \r\n\r\nPhase 4: This qualitative phase conducts focus groups with girls to explore how the final FRD Framework works to better engage them, and how their learning differs at exhibits that exemplify the principles in the Framework.",

Of the kinds of learning evidenced across the focus groups, repeating and varying activities at exhibits (Skill Building) emerged as the most differentiating between exhibits with and without the EDGE Design Attributes. \n\n \nSupplemental: Finally, the EDGE team obtained supplemental funds to reanalyze the EDGE study data to support ISE researchers in identifying important studies for further advancing the field. The reanalysis provides the relationships between all of the FRD Framework exhibit design attributes and the four measures of children?s engagement (use, time spent, returns, and behavior). The reanalysis also provides children?s engagement base rates across exhibits for the four engagement measures, which can inform exhibit development practice in addition to future research.  \n\n \n\nBroader impacts. As the nation is heralding the need for more STEM professionals from underserved audiences, museums can play a critical role in inspiring and preparing more girls in STEM. The EDGE project was designed to advance informal STEM learning by building museum developers? and educators? capacity for creating exhibits that better engage girls. The project outputs were developed to directly inform and impact practice. \n\n \n\nThe team co-created a freely available Guide to the EDGE Design Attributes (Image 3) with practitioners to provide an attractive guide to the research, its findings, and many examples of these attributes at exhibits. The project team also designed professional development workshops. Through the workshops we engaged over 150 practitioners directly with the project and in applying the findings (Images 4 &amp; 5). An ASTC Webinar gave a wider range of practitioners an introduction to the research, results, and application of the EDGE Design Attributes. These resources can be found on our project website: https://www.exploratorium.edu/education/research-evaluation/edge).   \n\n \n\nThe project team also produced four peer-reviewed journal articles and two CAISE Knowledge Base articles: \n\nDancstep      (n&eacute;e Dancu), T. &amp; Sindorf, L.
