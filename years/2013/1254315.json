 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop experimentally-validated physical models for graphene interconnects and to optimize and benchmark them against conventional metallic interconnects. The proposed research will model and experimentally validate: high-frequency signal propagation in mono- and multi-layer graphene nanoribbons; impact of contact shape and size, interconnect length and width, and edge quality on current distribution in multilayer graphene nanoribbons; and crosstalk noise and line-to-line interference amongst graphene nanoribbons. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is to provide the first unified electromagnetic/quantum mechanical model to analyze high-frequency signal transport in nanomaterials in general and in multilayer graphene interconnects in particular. Existing full-wave electromagnetic field simulators cannot capture the multi-physical nature of signal transport in nanomaterials. Crosstalk in nanoconductors such as graphene is fundamentally different than in conventional metallic wires. This is because the voltage applied to the neighboring interconnects would shift the Fermi energy of the victim line which would affect the victim?s conductance. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are: to create a new paradigm in teaching electron transport by developing a video game in which players navigate electrons or holes in a crystal and get to visualize and experience the key concepts in the physics of semiconductors; to engage undergraduate students taking Physics of Semiconductors to think creatively about the course materials and to create game scenarios aimed at learning various physical concepts; and to adopt the video game for K-12 students, their teachers, and the public, and for outreach activities to attract underrepresented minorities to engineering.",

Unlike transistors whose performance generally improves as they are made smaller, resistance of metallic wires increases dramatically as their cross-sectional dimensions are scaled below tens of nanometers. This is due to the fact that electrons interact with the wire surfaces quite frequently once the lateral dimensions become comparable with the average distance they travel before they get scattered by atom vibrations. As such, novel conductors that can provide lower resistances are subjects of intense research. Among the potential candidates sheets of carbon atoms called graphene have attracted major attention because of their unusually large electron mean free paths, being ultra-thin and therefore low capacitance, and their ability to conduct very large current densities. This project provided a comprehensive set of models for graphene interconnects, benchmarked them against their copper counterparts, and provided a set of guidelines for technology development of this emerging technology. Electrons in graphene nanoribbons are confined in very small thicknesses and widths because of which quantum mechanical effects in graphene are pronounced. The project developed/used a unified electromagnetic/quantum mechanical model to analyze the high-frequency response of multilayer graphene interconnects. It demonstrated that the interlayer resistivity is a key parameter that affects low- and high-frequency responses of these interconnects and extensive experiments were conducted to accurately measure it as a function of stacking order of graphene layers. The results from this project provide researchers in industry, government and academia with the requirements that must be met to make graphene interconnects a viable technology option for advanced generations of microchips.</p>\n<p>Quantum Mechanics (QM) is the foundation for science and engineering disciplines as diverse as physics, materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. However, educators face major challenges in teaching QM concepts given the abstract and non-experiential nature of QM concepts. Unlike most other subject matters, the laws of QM contradict our everyday experiences because of which the students feel \"QM does not make sense.\" Besides, QM is rooted in abstract probabilistic concepts, and it is difficult for students to visualize QM laws and behaviors. To address the above challenges a series of game modules governed by laws of QM were designed/developed as a way to engage alternative ways of teaching and learning QM in particular; and science and engineering in general. The game modules enable active and experiential learning by introducing and habituating students to QM concepts and characteristics, transforming its mathematical concepts to a rule system (game mechanics) that is easy to learn and master. The educational and research goals of this proposal were pursued in all three phases of design, development, and play (experimentation).
