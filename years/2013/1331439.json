 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project team has developed a way to seamlessly collect information from mobile device owners. By presenting simple questions on the mobile device at the right time (e.g., \"Have you eaten breakfast?\") and allowing a simple way for the owner to provide an answer, this technology opens up a number of interesting market opportunities. There are many applications of this simple interaction: gathering real-time market research information, performing a unique form of mobile crowdsourcing and a new form of peer-to-peer messaging that extends the capabilities of mobile text messaging. The mobility of the device and the frequency with which owners can perform this interaction provide an interesting ecosystem for asking and answering simple questions.\r\n\r\nThis technology may have applications in areas as broad as personal health monitoring, micro-learning, enhanced peer-peer communication, and surveying techniques. With wide-scale adoption, many different stakeholders will find value in the platform solution we will develop. These customers range from mobile applications developers wanting alternative ways to get input from users of their apps to large companies wanting to gather information from a large segment of their consumer population, or, most interestingly, a way for smaller entities to be able to effectively collect and benefit from their own market research efforts.",
