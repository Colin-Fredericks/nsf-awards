 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tank bromeliads are plants that grow on trees in the forest canopy in the Neotropics, deriving sustenance from the water and nutrients collected in the tanks formed at the base of their leaves. In addition to the ecological importance of tank bromeliads due to the rich communities sustained in and by the tank water, they are excellent case studies for investigating the role of environmental variables such as light in governing leaf water uptake. Many bromeliad species can occur at several positions in the canopy, thus even a single host tree can provide a range of plants from different light exposures. The capacity of leaves to transport water, or leaf hydraulic conductance, can determine a plant's ability to succeed in its environment, and light can determine that capacity due to long-term effects on leaf anatomy and morphology and short-term effects on leaf physiology. \r\n\r\nBecause tank bromeliads virtually lack absorptive roots and stems, they also provide excellent models in which to investigate external and internal regulators of leaf hydraulic conductance. The relatively simple strap-shape of the leaves as well as their parallel venation facilitate measurement and modeling of leaf  hydraulic conductance for bromeliads, and their use of tanks as reservoirs allows manipulation of the water supply to investigate the effects of environmental and internal regulators. Specifically, light and pH are known to affect leaf hydraulic conductance at least in part via their effects on aquaporins, proteins that regulate water movement across membranes.\t\r\n\r\nThis research is truly integrative in that the regulation of leaf hydraulic conductance will be assessed in the field at the level of plant responses to light variation within the forest canopy as well as in the laboratory, using experimental manipulations of light, tank-water pH, and aquaporin inhibitors. Aquaporin gene expression in leaves from different light exposures and in different leaf regions will also be measured and compared. For plants in both field and laboratory, anatomical and morphological traits will be investigated and incorporated into a model of leaf hydraulic conductance that will be further informed and tested by microscopic examination of the pathways indicated by tracer and diagnostic staining. Because the leaves of tank bromeliads are the organs of both supply and demand, understanding how their leaf hydraulic conductance is regulated is fundamental to understanding their ecological function and how they might respond to changes that are rapidly occurring in tropical forests. The role of tank bromeliads and other plants that grow in the branches of the tropical tree canopy is predicted to become even more important as primary forest becomes more fragmented and is replaced by secondary forest.\r\n\r\nThe research will be carried out entirely by the principal investigator and undergraduate students, both in the field at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica and in the laboratory at Occidental College. A key component of the proposed research is its use of a field station in Costa Rica, in part because Occidental College's location in Los Angeles attracts many students with personal and intellectual ties to Latin America. One major goal of the proposed research is to strengthen those ties and to develop an international experience for undergraduates that will demonstrate the role of science in understanding how people and other organisms are linked by global processes such as water use and changes in forest structure.",

Members of a large family of plants found mostly in the tropical rainforest, tank bromeliads generally experience substantial annual rainfall. However, like all epiphytes, or plants that grow on other plants, they do not have access to soil moisture. They collect and take up rainwater in the chambers or &ldquo;tanks&rdquo; formed by their leaf bases, and our results indicate that low rates of water movement through leaves (low leaf hydraulic conductance) are important in prolonging plant water supply. Although bromeliads are angiosperms, or flowering plants, values for their leaf hydraulic conductance are similar to the low values that have been reported for the evolutionarily less advanced ferns and gymnosperms. This result was presented in a paper in 2013 that also developed a theoretical, broadly applicable model that allowed the relative contributions of the two different pathways for water movement, inside versus outside the leaf veins, to be assessed and predicted for a range of conditions.</p>\n<p>We also determined that tank bromeliads differ in their ability to adjust their leaf hydraulic conductance to match the demand for water that varies according to light exposure of the plants. We investigated two species of bromeliad in the same genus that are very similar morphologically and co-occur in the same habitats yet tend to receive different levels of sunlight due to their different positions within the tree canopy. Moreover, one of the species has a broader range than the other, both geographically and within the forest, ultimately reaching much higher levels of both altitude and light. Plasticity, or the evolved ability of an organism to alter its physical, chemical and behavioral responses to varying environmental conditions, proved to be greater in the more wide-ranging species of bromeliad with respect to leaf hydraulic conductance and light-driven water demand, as was described in a 2016 paper. Several morphological and anatomical traits contributed to such plasticity, including decreased leaf area and increased diameter of water-conducting cells in leaf veins for plants that developed in higher light.</p>\n<p>Postdoctoral associate Dr. Erin Brinton and a team of Occidental College undergraduates in the lab discovered part of the molecular underpinnings of leaf hydraulic conductance for tank bromeliads. Specifically, Dr. Brinton and the students were able to isolate and quantify expression of a gene for a membrane-spanning protein in the aquaporin gene family. Aquaporins regulate water movement across cell membranes in all plant organs, including leaves, and our lab has determined that their gene expression changes in response to water-deprivation and rehydration for one species of tank bromeliad, as detailed in our most recent presentation at the Ecological Society of America annual meeting. A manuscript detaining the hydraulic response of a tank bromeliad to drying and rewetting is nearly ready for submission. We had hypothesized that aquaporin activity would also differ under different light regimes, but we saw little evidence for this in our field or lab experiments. Aquaporins are known to be inhibited by acidity (low pH), which we investigated because of the unusually low pH that can occur in the tank water of bromeliads. We are completing our analysis of the interactions between aquaporin activity and pH in two species of tank bromeliad in a manuscript to be submitted.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project have been substantial, primarily with respect to the scientific springboard that it has provided&nbsp; for 27 undergraduate students working on tank bromeliads in Costa Rica and in the lab at Occidental since 2012. Of the smaller group of students who received research stipends funded by this grant, eight are in graduate school in STEM disciplines, including at UCLA, UC Riverside, University of Colorado, and University of Georgia. One is in medical school. They are a diverse group of young people, including 12 women, 12 people of color, and 5 students from under-represented minorities (note that these categories can overlap). Six different students were co-authors on papers, and several more were co-authors and presenters of talks and posters at international meetings, including the annual meetings of the Botanical Society of America and the Ecological Society of America. Three students presented their research to an international group of students, scientists, and staff at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, managed by the Organization for Tropical Studies. Several students have also been involved in presenting their research on tropical bromeliads and other plants to students from Los Angeles middle schools and high schools who come to Occidental College to participate in pre-college programs such as Upward Bound and Neighborhood Partners. A graduate of one of these programs is enrolled at Occidental and currently is doing research on leaf hydraulics and heat tolerance in my lab.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gretchen&nbsp;B&nbsp;North</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258499/1258499_10248380_1506962808216_PCE-Bromeliad-cover-2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258499/1258499_10248380_1506962808216_PCE-Bromeliad-cover-2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cover of Plant Cell &amp; Environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258499/1258499_10248380_1506962808216_PCE-Bromeliad-cover-2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Plant Cell &amp; Environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Paper from the North lab is in this issue: A tale of two plasticities: leaf hydraulic conductances and related traits diverge for two tropical epiphytes from contrasting light environments.
