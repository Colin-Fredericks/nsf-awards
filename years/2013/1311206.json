 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for two workshops that will investigate the potential of empirical/statistical downscaling, a method to estimate how local climate is affected by regional and/or global conditions, to help develop a robust knowledge platform for decisions regarding adaptation to environmental change. This approach will bring together the research community, stakeholders and practitioners to establish a more rigorous foundation for the evaluation of data generated by this technique and to investigate the efficacy of including the data in outputs targeted at the needs of the adaptation and impact communities. The workshop will bring together an international community that will contribute a strong scientific base to a broad range of ongoing and proposed stake-holder relevant adaptation activities.",
