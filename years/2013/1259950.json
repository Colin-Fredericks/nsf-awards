 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ASPIRE project provides scholarships to support academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in STEM at Johnson C. Smith University. In addition to scholarship aid, students are being supported through such activities as early involvement in undergraduate research driven by community challenges and a STEM mentoring network which includes peers, faculty, alumni and local industry professionals. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the well-conceived plan that leverages financial support for students with new activities and existing resources at this historically black college. The combination provides comprehensive support for the STEM scholars, in many cases shortening time to degree. The broader impacts include connecting talented graduates with the STEM workforce and graduate programs, as well as providing a well-assessed model for similar institutions in the region and beyond.",

ASPIRE scholars were retained at a rate of 93% and of those retained 100% graduated within five years with a STEM degree.  Further, the successes of early research experiences via Research Interest Groups (RIGs) prepared students to be more competitive in applying for external research experiences.

Through the creation of a STEM Mentoring Network (involving STEM upperclassmen, STEM alumni, and local industry professionals), the JCSU S-STEM project was able to prepare and place over 90% of its scholars earning STEM degrees in graduate STEM programs or STEM Industry.    After graduation, ASPIRE scholars had been accepted to a STEM graduate program (65%), were working in a STEM field (29%), or entered the military or a medical school preparation program (6%).  Through its partnerships the program provided experiential education opportunities to underrepresented students.  Formative assessment measures were used throughout to ensure the project met its student outcomes while leveraging other campus STEM and student resources. \n\n \n\nSome notable outcomes of the project include:\n\n \n\nScholars trended higher than the university with 95% of scholars having conducted/or been accepted to a research experience.

These partnerships supported scholars by hosting seminars, field trips and training in targeted dossier tool development.  As a result of these efforts graduates were placed in STEM graduate programs or accepted job offers in STEM Industry at a rate of approximately 94% with most of the scholars completing the individualized vertical academic and professional plan and regularly meeting with mentors to discuss future aspirations.\n\n\n Designed to provide solutions to institutional challenges for STEM students, over a six-year period, ASPIRE offered support in finance, education, retention as well as graduate school and career placement.
