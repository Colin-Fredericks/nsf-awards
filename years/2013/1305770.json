 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nThe research in this project will develop improved understanding of novel magnetism created by optical excitation in type-II  (II-Mn)-VI quantum dots, and will explore controlling magnetic properties by optical beams. Recently discovered optical and magnetic phenomena in these type-II quantum dots, as well as interesting re-entrant magnetic states predicted by theory collaborators will be investigated. The research program involves MBE growth, structural, compositional and magnetic characterization, CW and time-resolved interband magneto-optical spectroscopy and terahertz intraband spectroscopy of ensembles and single quantum dot columns, as well as associated theory. This effort  will lead to a better understanding of the basic physics and materials issues of these type-II columnar quantum dots in the (II,Mn)-VI materials systems. The PIs at UB will host an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP) supported teacher in interdisciplinary research in their laboratories with the objective of expanding opportunities to link materials and solid state physics research to the middle and high school classroom.  In addition, building on previous success, a one-week summer workshop in the second summer of the grant to provide an introduction to magnetic phenomena and their application to everyday devices will be conducted; high school teachers from the area will participate.  \r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nThis project will explore controlling magnetic properties of nanostructures using optical beams.  The research team involves two senior co-PIs and theory collaborators from the University at Buffalo, a co-PI at the University of Oklahoma and collaborators in MBE growth at the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. The PIs will explore novel magnetic states in quantum dots that incorporate magnetic ions such as manganese. These magnetic quantum dots  will serve as platform for inducing, manipulating and controlling magnetism by light. The effort  will lead to a better understanding of the basic physics and materials issues of these quantum dot systems. The experiments, which will ultimately focus on individual columns of dots, are challenging, and there is a great deal of interesting physics predicted to occur in these systems, as well as likely unanticipated discoveries. The PIs at UB will host an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP)-supported teacher in interdisciplinary research in their laboratories with the objective of expanding opportunities to link materials and solid state physics research to the middle and high school classroom.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWe modeled the results summarized in Fig. 1 i.e. the large increase of the PL peak energy saturation red shift induced by an external magnetic field in sample B  (ZnTe QDs embedded in a ZnMnSe matrix)  when we use laser excitation with photon energy below the ZnMnSe matrix bandgap (488 nm). Under this excitation, electron-hole pairs can be photo-generated only in the ZnTe  QDs.  In contrast, excitation with photon energy above the matrix bandgap (405 nm) results in the photo-excitation of carriers mainly in the ZnMnSe matrix.  The holes then must be captured by the ZnTe QDs (see fig. 2b).  Once a hole occupies the ZnTe QD it is unlikely that it will be occupied by a second hole due to the Coulomb hole-hole repulsion.  Excitation using 488 nm photons on the other hand does not have this limitation since the holes are excited directly inside the ZnTe QDs.  Our model examines the consequences of the presence of two holes inside the ZnTe QDs.  The method consists of constructing a matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of Slater determinants of single particle states.  Diagonalization of the matrix gives us the eigenvalues and the corresponding wavefunctions.  The terms in the Hamiltonian are: the kinetic energy, a two-dimensional harmonic potential, and the Coulomb hole-hole interaction.  In fig.3 we show the triplet hole wavefunctions as follows: Top frame: no Coulomb interaction is included; 36 % of the hole wavefunction lies outside the classic radius Rcls and thus inside the magnetic matrix.  Bottom frame: Coulomb interaction is now included; in this case 54 % of the hole wavefunction lies in the ZnMnSe matrix.   The increased spread of the hole wavefunction inside the matrix results in an enhances exchange interaction between the hole and the Mn spins, and therefore an increased red shift of the PL peak energy in agreement with the results shown in fig. 1.   We now include in the Hamiltonian the exchange interaction between the spins of the holes and those of the Mn ions in the ZnMnSe matrix.  A schematic is shown in fig.4.  The red arrows indicate the hole spins, the green arrows the Mn spins and the black arrow the electron spin.  The presence of the exchange interaction results in a further spread of the hole wavefunction.  This is shown in fig.5.   Right frame: Mn molar fraction = 1 % ; Middle frame: Mn molar fraction = 2 %, Right frame: Mn molar fraction = 3 %.  This trend is in agreement with the experimental results.  The results described above are included in a manuscript under preparation.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe broader impact consists of the scientific training of two graduate students and one undergraduate.   They were trained in various spectroscopic techniques as well as the use of cryogenics, lasers, and magnetic fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Athos Petrou"
