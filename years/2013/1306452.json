During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Brix will work on a project titled, \"Investigation into the Genetic Controls of Osmoregulation in Freshwater Fish\" under the co-sponsorship of Professors Dolph Schluter, Colin Brauner, and Chris Wood at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of ancient marine fish into freshwater environments represents one of the most physiologically significant developments in vertebrate evolution, with multiple invasions occurring over the past 400 million years. A diversity of processes by which fish maintain salt balance in freshwater has been identified, but no systematic effort has been made to understand the genetic factors controlling this diversity. This project will use the stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to investigate the genetic control of salt balance in freshwater fish. Stickleback has independently invaded freshwater multiple times, providing a powerful model for examining the evolution of salt balance in fish. Dr. Brix will characterize these processes in freshwater and marine stickleback populations and then use genetic mapping techniques to identify the genes controlling differences in salt balance between populations. Stickleback has become an increasingly valuable genetic model for an array of physiological and morphological processes. The genes controlling changes in body shape are now understood and exert control over similar processes in other vertebrates, including humans. This project will develop a similar level of understanding for salt balance with the possibility that key genes identified in stickleback may be important for other fish species and vertebrates in general. \r\n\r\nThrough this fellowship, Dr. Brix will become a member of the Biodiversity Research Centre and associated Beaty Biodiversity Museum (http://www.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/) at UBC, where he will actively participate in the extensive K-12 educational outreach programs on biodiversity and evolution using stickleback as a teaching tool.  Additionally, through a Science without Borders grant to Dr. Wood, he will have an opportunity to teach a course at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil on integrating fish physiology and the gene mapping techniques. \r\n\r\nThis award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.",

During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Brix worked on a project titled, \"Investigation into the Genetic Controls of Osmoregulation in Freshwater Fish\" under the co-sponsorship of Professors Dolph Schluter, Colin Brauner, and Chris Wood at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nThe invasion of ancient marine fish into freshwater environments represents one of the most physiologically significant developments in vertebrate evolution, with multiple invasions occurring over the past 400 million years. A diversity of processes by which fish maintain salt balance in freshwater have been identified, but no significant systematic effort has been made to understand the genetic factors controlling this diversity.  This project initially aimed to use the stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to investigate the genetic control of salt balance in freshwater fish. Stickleback have independently invaded freshwater multiple times providing a powerful model for examining the evolution of salt balance in freshwater fish.  However, initial experiments with stickleback demonstrated that there are almost no differences in the mechanisms by which freshwater and marine populations of stickleback maintain salt balance when both populations are acclimated to freshwater.  This is a very surprising result as there are numerous studies indicating that genes involved in salt balance are under strong selection when marine stickleback populations invade freshwater.  More study is clearly needed to understand why it appears these genes are under such strong selection and yet there are no apparent differences in whole animal performance.\n\nConsidering the initial results with stickleback, the project instead focused on a different model organism, the pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus.  This species lives in estuarine and coastal habitats and is generally not able to maintain salt balance in freshwater.  However, there is a unique population isolated in several lakes in central Florida that has adapted to freshwater.  Dr. Brix comparatively studies these populations during his Ph.D. under a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and demonstrated significant genetically based differences in both the mechanisms and ultimately capacity of the two populations maintain salt balance in freshwater.\n\nThe project involved hybridizing the freshwater and estuarine pupfish populations and ultimately generating 400 F2 hybrids for study.  Several different techniques (measuring Na+ uptake, whole body ion composition, and survival after transfer to dilute freshwater) were then used to characterize how well these hybrids maintained salt balance in freshwater.  After these measurements were made, fish were sampled for genomic DNA which is currently being sequenced.  The technique used to sequence DNA (Genotype by Sequencing) will provide ~30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the pupfish genome for each of the 400 fish.  Once these data are available in early 2016, a Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis will be performed to associate characteristics related to salt balance (e.g., Na+ uptake) to specific SNPs.  This will allow for the identification of key genes involved in the adaptation of pupfish to maintain salt balance in freshwater.  This data will also be used in a collaborative project lead by Dr. Wes Warren at Washington University to help assemble the pupfish genome.\n\nIn addition to the research described above, Dr. Brix had the opportunity to learn a variety of molecular biology and data analysis techniques used in quantitative evolutionary biology from one of the pre-eminent scientists in the field, Dr. Dolph Schulter.  In exchange, Dr. Brix provided training in various techniques used in comparative physiology to undergraduate and ..."
