  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDark matter and dark energy are the dominant components of the Universe today, yet we do not know what they are.  Gravitational lensing, the deflection of light by mass, is one of the best ways to map out the distribution of dark matter in the Universe, because the dark matter has mass just like ordinary matter does and so can distort the images of galaxies behind it.  Lensing can also be used to study the dark energy, which affects how large-scale structures have grown in the Universe.  Ongoing large sky surveys are making increasingly precise measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and future surveys will make even better measurements.  Ensuring these measurements are not contaminated by systematic errors is a key focus of the cosmological community.\n\nThis goal of this proposal was to develop advanced techniques in weak lensing for cosmology, in both data analysis and theoretical understanding. The work focuses on mitigating several systematic uncertainties that affect dark energy measurements to below the 1% level. The methods developed will be important for interpreting the results of upcoming lensing surveys, such as the one planned for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the top ground-based priority of the 2010 Decadal Survey. \n\nDuring the proposal period, the project participants successfully used existing data to constrain intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes, which are a contaminant of weak lensing measurements.  These measurements can be used to build better models of intrinsic alignments. \n\nThe participants also built an open-source software package to analyze data and detect systematic errors in weak lensing measurements.
