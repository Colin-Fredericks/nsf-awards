 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project investigates the attitudes and beliefs held by mobile home residents about taking shelter from tornadoes. Mobile home residents are disproportionately affected by tornadoes. They make up about 6% of the population of the United States, but account for about 45% of tornado deaths. Previous studies investigated what people knew about tornadoes or how they perceived danger from tornadoes. This project takes a different approach and focuses on what people know about sheltering strategies and how they perceive the effectiveness of those actions in preventing harm. For example, people who believe they are not able to carry out sufficient actions to protect themselves from a tornado may develop negative attitudes toward sheltering behavior. Such negative attitudes can lead them to ignore warnings and put themselves at greater risk from tornadoes. The first goal of this project is to identify a few common sets of attitudes and beliefs about tornado sheltering within mobile home communities. This will be accomplished by a series of interviews with mobile home residents in South Carolina, where mobile homes are as prominent in the housing sector as any other state in the United States. After the interviews, a questionnaire will be mailed to random occupied mobile home units in South Carolina; this will provide data for the remaining goals of the project. A second goal is to discover if certain types of attitudes and beliefs are more prevalent in different sectors of the population. For example, the study will investigate gender, age, race and ethnicity, family structure, education, mobility, and several other factors to determine how these relate to attitudes and beliefs about taking shelter from tornadoes. This project will also research whether mobile home residents living in different geographic situations have different tornado sheltering strategies. Many mobile homes are situated in and near urban areas within mobile home parks containing dozens of units. However, there are also large numbers of mobile homes in rural areas which are single-sited units situated in areas with fewer roads and nearby sturdy structures. The final goal of this project is to find out what mobile home residents intend to do when tornadoes threaten, and to understand which factors discussed above are most important in their decisions as to what to do. This will enable the building of a conceptual framework for how mobile home residents develop tornado sheltering plans and take action, or why they fail to do so.\r\n\r\nThis project benefits society by fostering awareness and education to reduce the number of deaths and injuries in mobile homes as a result of tornadoes. The interview and questionnaire data will be made available to researchers and practitioners interested in the issue of tornado sheltering. Results of the study will be presented at national meetings attended by meteorologists from the National Weather Service, emergency managers from federal, state, and local agencies, and other researchers. The findings will inform new education and outreach programs, as well as aid in improving communication between the public and those in the emergency management and meteorology sectors. The methodologies used in this study will provide an example for future work to investigate mobile home resident tornado sheltering in other regions of the United States. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this study also provides support enabling a promising student to establish a career as an independent researcher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTornadoes strike the central and eastern United States more often than anywhere else in the world, and one group consistently suffers the greatest impacts from tornadoes: residents who live in manufactured homes.  Manufactured homes, while an important source of affordable housing, are not built to withstand tornadic winds.  As a result, manufactured home residents are told that they should leave their homes and find sturdy shelter when tornadoes threaten.  Yet, most residents do not follow this recommendation.  The main goals of this research were to improve understanding of why persons who live in manufactured homes do or do not form plans to protect themselves from tornadoes, and to collect information about the sheltering strategies of those who do make plans.  To accomplish these goals, we interviewed twenty persons who live in manufactured housing and then distributed a survey via the mail which was returned by over 200 occupants of manufactured homes.  We are able to draw some useful conclusions from what people said in the interviews and the answers that people gave to the survey questions.\n\n \n\nWe found that there are three basic types of perspectives about tornado safety amongst the manufactured home population.    The first type is not very concerned about tornadoes and therefore does not see a need to make sheltering plans, build tornado shelters, or seek and use information about the weather.  This view is more common in men, persons who identified as white, and persons who reported higher incomes; it is also more common in persons who own their home, have a double-wide manufactured home, and believe that their home is able to withstand windstorms.  The second type of perspective is in some ways the opposite of the first type; this perspective shows concern about tornadoes and has a willingness to take precautions and make a safety plan ahead of time.  This second viewpoint is more common in women, persons who rent their home, and those who live in single-wide manufactured homes.  The third type of perspective is also very concerned about tornadoes, but is focused less on preparedness and planning and more on anticipating and responding to immediate dangers related to thunderstorms and tornadoes.  The third viewpoint is more common in those who have lower incomes, have children under 18 living in their home, identify as African-American, and believe that their home is less resistant to windstorms.\n\n \n\nThis research also gathered data about where manufactured home residents might go for shelter and how much time they need to get there using hypothetical warning situations.  We learned that about 30% have previously evacuated because of a tornado, and about 20% have access to a tornado shelter within five miles of their home.  For the other 80%, the most common places they would go for shelter are the home of a friend or relative, a school, or a church.  The average estimated travel time to these possible shelter destinations is about ten to fifteen minutes.  Roughly 35% say they would leave their home to go to a shelter destination with five minutes warning time before a tornado might arrive.  With fifteen minutes warning time, about 55% would leave their home, but increasing warning time to 45 minutes only slightly increases the percentage of persons who would leave their home to about 60%.  These percentages did not change much whether the hypothetical situation was for the daytime or the nighttime.  For the fifteen minute warning time case, those who have a plan and who have a shelter destination nearby, and who trust warning messages are more likely to leave their manufactured home and go for shelter.  Several other factors are also important, such as having children and/or pets in the home, being of older age, and living in a rented unit.  Surprisingly, we did not observe large differences between the plans of those living in urban and rural areas, or between those living in mobile home parks and those living ..."
