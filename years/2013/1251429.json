 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates language comprehension: how humans make predictions as they hear a sentence about how the sentence will continue. Language comprehension promises to shed light on how the mind integrates general knowledge with past experiences to deal with new situations. However, past studies of language comprehension have been limited to 'major' world languages (English, other European languages, Chinese, Japanese) and college-age students. This severely underrepresents the diversity of the world's languages and populations, and could potentially lead to scientific conclusions that are distorted or incomplete. This project broadens the range of research on language comprehension through the study of Chamorro, an Austronesian language of Micronesia. \r\n\r\nChamorro is spoken by 45,000 people in the Mariana Islands, which are part of the U.S. and its possessions. It is currently in the early stages of language endangerment. Dr. Matthew Wagers (a psycholinguist), Dr. Sandra Chung (a linguist), and Manuel Borja (a Chamorro native-speaker and educator) will undertake experimental studies that build on special linguistic features of Chamorro to uncover how Chamorro speakers comprehend their language in real time. In Chamorro, the verb comes first in the sentence; verb agreement differentiates questions from non-questions; and sentence structure is affected by animacy. Although these features also occur in other languages, they are rarely studied in psycholinguistics. \r\n\r\nThe studies will involve participants of many ages and educational levels in three of the Mariana Islands. Several young Chamorros will be trained in the goals and methods of the research and will help administer the studies. This project will broaden the empirical base of research on language comprehension. The experimental protocols developed can be extended to research on other languages not spoken in highly industrialized societies. The investigation will expose community members to scientific research, and in so doing, will affirm the unique contributions that a language can make to the scientific understanding of human cognition.",

This project aimed to broaden the empirical base of psycholinguistic research by investigating Chamorro, an Austronesian language spoken in the Mariana Islands. We asked how speakers comprehend questions, relative clauses, and other constructions on a moment-by-moment basis, as each new word is processed. Chamorro has linguistic features that differentiate it from the languages usually studied in psycholinguistic research: sentences are verb-first, the object cannot outrank the subject in animacy, relative clauses can precede or follow the noun they modify, and a special verb agreement distinguishes wh-dependencies (questions and relative clauses) from simple sentences. The goal was to use these features to investigate from a new angle how sentence comprehension works. A second goal was to develop techniques for psycholinguistic experiments that would be effective with participants of diverse ages and backgrounds in a range of cultural settings. Finally, since Chamorro is in the beginning stages of language endangerment, a third goal was to use the experimental results to explore how well the language is being maintained across different generations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the three years of the project we conducted six large experimental studies &nbsp;in the three inhabited islands of U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, involving nearly five hundred unique participants whose ages ranged from 20 to 80. These studies investigated the comprehension and production of wh-dependencies and, separately, the comprehension of reflexive dependencies. The research led to a far better understanding of general processing pressures familiar from better-studied languages, such as the language-universal tendency to parse subjects first. They also revealed that morphological information can defeat general processing pressures by pointing uniquely to one parse; however, when this morphological information is absent and more than one parse is possible, comprehension is delayed. The studies employed various techniques&mdash;self-paced listening, a variant of preferential looking, and touch-tracking on a tablet computer. Touch-tracking was the most comfortable, effective technique for participants of all ages and backgrounds, and could generalize well to other small-language communities. Touch-tracking generated a rich data set, including choice data as well as dynamic timing data. Finally, although older Chamorros strongly feel the decline of language fluency in younger generations, the results showed few differences by age group. The data suggested instead that participants of all ages had full control of Chamorro morphology, but younger participants had more difficulty comprehending sentences in which multiple words had to be integrated into a coherent larger structure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project had significant broader impacts. Hundreds of individuals from the islands of Saipan, Tinian, and Rota participated in the experiments. The experimental results, and what they revealed about language variation, language maintenance, and cognition, were reported in five public presentations for the community. The illustrations used in the experiments were made available for Chamorro teachers to use in their classrooms. Finally, the project involved two young Chamorros in experimental research, and provided training that contributed to the successful placement of several graduate students in industry.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/07/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;Wagers</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1251429/1251429_10231578_1481133608112_ChamorroAcrossGenerationsIslands.CommunityPresentation_Sep2014(dragged)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1251429/1251429_10231578_1481133608112_ChamorroAcrossGenerationsIslands.CommunityPresentation_Sep2014(dragged)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Community partners\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1251429/1251429_10231578_1481133608112_ChamorroAcrossGenerationsIslands.CommunityPresentation_Sep2014(dragged)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Community partners\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Many organizations and individuals across the CNMI assisted in our research ? recruiting participants  providing, testing space and forums for presentation and discussion.
