 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is one key segment of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime over the U.S. Great lakes region and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this group will focus on so-called \"long-fetch\" storm events, for which low-level winds are aligned approximately parallel to Lake Ontario's long axis.  Observational assets to be employed during OWLeS include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other deployable surface measurement systems.  These researchers contend that predictions of the amounts and inland extent of LeS snowfall remain poor, due in part to fine-scale variations in upwind planetary boundary layer structure and poor representation of cloud microphysical, dynamical, and surface processes.  To address these shortcomings, the intellectual merits of this research will derive from improved understanding of:  1) How long-fetch LeS intensify and evolve downwind of the lake, where prolonged heavy snowfall rates are particularly impactful; 2) how cloud and dynamical processes may contribute to cloud electrification and to lightning, as occasionally observed in long-fetch LeS heavy precipitation cells; and 3) how dual-polarimetric (and in select regions, dual-Doppler) radar measurements at X- and S-band wavelengths as utilized by mobile-DOW and operational National Weather Service WSR-88D radars, respectively, may reveal detailed precipitation processes in LeS.  Through detailed comparisons with in-situ aircraft measurements, evaluations dual-polarimetric particle identification and quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) algorithms will extend the utility of remote-sensing observations in this unique cool-season environment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include experience infield campaign planning, hands-on data collection and data analysis for a notably large number of undergraduate as well as graduate students.  A desirable mix of junior and senior principal investigators will facilitate exchange of established and complex project design and observing methodologies, and foster improved field observing techniques tailored to severe winter weather conditions.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.  Given the significant impacts of lake effect snowfall on public safety and economic activity along the populous shores of the U.S. Great Lakes, improved understanding of lake-effect systems should foster refined models and forecasting techniques that will address a longer-term societal need.",

Places like Buffalo NY and the Tug Hill are known to occasionally receive many feet of snow from a single cold-air outbreak. This grant has yielded great insight into the structure and development of long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) lake-effect snow bands over Lake Ontario. These systems often feature a narrow, intense band that is driven by a well-organized thermally direct secondary circulation in the vertical plane across the band, with strong low-level convergence, and narrow, intense updraft (3-10 m/s), and divergence in the upper well-mixed layer. It is well-known that intensity of lake-effect snow is affected by the difference between the lake water temperature and the temperature of the air blown over the lake. Our study for the first time sheds light on the presence and structure of the secondary circulation, which cannot be detected by the operational weather radars, and the role of wind speed in intense lake-effect snow. We primarily use vertical-plane single- and dual-Doppler radar data from the Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) aboard the University of Wyoming King Air, as well as high-resolution numerical model simulations. When the wind is strong, as observed in three cases during OWLeS, the LLAP band is deep, intense, and produces heavy snowfall along-shore and far inland. But when the wind is weak, the LLAP band is shallower, weaker, and rapidly dissipates as it moves onshore, producing only light snowfall closer to the shoreline. Remarkably, in both cases a well-defined secondary circulation develops upstream along a shallow, baroclinic land-breeze front originating along a bulge in the lake&rsquo;s southern shoreline (see schematic figure, attached). As the band extends downstream, buoyancy&mdash;driven in part by latent heating&mdash;becomes the dominant forcing mechanism, leading to band intensification and a deeper, stronger, and more symmetric secondary circulation over the lake. The band&rsquo;s depth, inland penetration and snowfall amount are influenced primarily by the strength of the prevailing flow, which drive the magnitude of the surface heat fluxes and impact the strength, depth, and orientation of secondary land-breeze fronts downwind of the lake.
