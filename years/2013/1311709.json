 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems arise in many applications. The widely known examples are aeroelasticity and biofluids. In biofluidic applications, such as, e.g., the study of interaction between blood flow and cardiovascular tissue, the coupling between the fluid and the relatively light structure is highly nonlinear, requiring sophisticated ideas for the study of their solutions. In the blood flow application, the problems are further exacerbated by the fact that the walls of major arteries are composed of several layers, each with different mechanical characteristics. No results exist so far that analyze solutions to fluid-structure interaction problems in which the structure is composed of several different layers. The proposed research takes a first step in this direction by proposing a program to study the existence of solutions to a class of FSI problems describing the interaction between a multi-layered structure and the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, giving rise to a fully coupled, nonlinear moving boundary, fluid-multi-structure interaction problem. The analysis relies on a novel, loosely coupled, partitioned, time-marching numerical scheme, and on novel compactness arguments providing convergence of the numerical scheme to a weak solution of the nonlinear fluid-multi-layered structure interaction problem. The proposed program opens up a new field within the area of FSI problems. This work brings to light several features that have not been studied before. In particular, this work reveals a new regularizing mechanism in FSI problems that is due to the presence of a fluid-structure interface with mass. The inertia of the fluid-structure interface regularizes the evolution of the entire FSI solution.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting, novel study requiring the development of original mathematical techniques motivated by an important biological application: the interaction between blood flow and human arterial walls. It is well-known that arterial walls are composed of several layers, each with different mechanical characteristics and thickness. The healthy physiology and the pathophysiology of the human cardiovascular system are significantly affected by the pulsation of arterial walls during each cardiac cycle. However, the interaction between the different arterial wall layers and their interaction with blood flow is still not completely understood. For example, recent developments in ultrasound speckle tracking methods revealed significant shear strain between the different layers of arterial walls in high adrenaline situations. The consequences of this phenomenon on the initiation of cardiovascular disease are yet to be understood. The proposed research makes a step in this direction by designing mathematical models, and by analyzing solutions of the mathematical models that capture fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and arterial walls in the case when arterial walls are modeled as multi-layered structures. No mathematical results exist so far in this area, and the proposed research opens up a new area in the field of fluid-structure interaction problems. The work proposed here promises to develop a strong partnership between the University of Houston, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Zagreb, and the Texas Medical Center in Houston. The PI is a woman, and active recruitment of minorities and women to participate in this research is proposed.",

Examples include the human heart and heart valves interacting with blood flow (see Fig. 1), biodegradable micro-beads swimming in water to clean up water pollution, a micro camera in the human intestine used for an early colon cancer detection, and design of next generation vascular stents to prop open the clogged arteries, and prevent heart attacks (see Figs. 2, 3 and 4). Interestingly enough, even though the mathematical theory of the motion of bodies in a liquid is one of the oldest and most classical problems in in fluid mechanics, mathematicians have only very recently become interested in a systematic study of the basic problems related to fluid-structure interaction. One reason for this may be that problems of this type are notoriously difficult to study, and novel mathematical methods to tackle the nonlinearities in the problem needed to be developed on a case-by-case bases. Indeed, the PI on this proposal is one of the leaders in this field. In this project, together with her collaborator and former postdoc Muha, they have developed a mathematical \"machinery\" to study a number of problems, on a case-by-case basis, involving interaction between the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and various elastic structures. In particular, the most recent results in this project address FSI with composite, sandwich structures, and structures supported by thin metallic meshes, such as those used in bioartificial heart valves and in vascular protheses called stents. In each of these works a constructive existence proof was designed based on discretizing the coupled problem in time, and separating the fluid from the structure sub-problem in just the right way so that the \"communication\" between the fluid and structure subproblems at every time step gives rise to a stable numerical scheme. Thus, existence is proved by constructing a scheme, i.e., constructing approximate solutions, which converge, as the time discretization step goes to zero, to a (weak) solution of the coupled FSI problem. To prove that the scheme converges to a (weak) solution, a novel mathematical \"compactness argument\" needed to be designed. In the last year of this project, Canic and Muha obtained a compactness result which is a break through result in this area. They obtained a generalization of the famous Aubin-Lions-Simon compactness lemma to a large class of problems (operators) defined on time-dependent function spaces associated with moving domains. This result is a major step forward toward building a systematic, constructive theory of existence of solutions to FSI problems, and is a stepping stone toward the development of a unified framework for constructive existence theory of (weak) solutions to fluid-structure interaction problems involving incompressible, viscous fluids interacting with elastic structures.</p>\n<p>In addition to the theoretical results described above, the PI together with her collaborator Bukac and postdoc Wang, have designed a novel computational partitioned scheme, which is constructed based on the main steps of the existence proof. The computational scheme was applied to study the performance of four currently available coronary stents on the US market, in curved (tortuous) coronary arteries in terms of biomechanical environment induced by each implanted stent (see Figs 2, 3, and ). It was found that the geometry of the Cypher-like stent outperforms the three other stents (Express-like stent, Xience-like stent, and Palmaz-like stent) in terms of excessive intramural VonMises stress (which is associated with complications such as atherogenesis and thrombogenesis), and in terms of the jump in traction across the intimal layer of the treated artery (which is associated with disruption and rupture of internal elastic lamiane and neointimal hyperplasia).</p>\n<p>The methodology developed in this project was also used in optimal design of a stent for a bioartificial heart valve, known as Colibri Valve, shown in Fig. 1.</p>\n<p>Further research on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involving poroelastic structures is under way. The motivation for poroelastic FSI comes from the most recent collaboration with the UCSF Bioengineering Department (Dr. S. Roy) in which optimal design of a bioartificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetic patients is being investigated.</p>\n<p>In addition to research, this project produced three PhDs, two of whom are females, with Assistant Professorship positions in academia, and one with a job in industry (Siemens).
