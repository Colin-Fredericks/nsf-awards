 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quantitative characterization of neuronal morphology is currently among the most fundamental objectives in neuroscience, as it is essential to precisely correlate structure, activity and neuronal communication at the cellular level. It has been long established that neurons respond to external stimuli through significant structural changes. Hence, the ability to quantitatively capture and track these changes is fundamental for understanding the cell-level biology of brain functions.  Dendritic spines, in particular, are are sub-cellular structures, which play a key-role in how neurons talk to each other; these structural changes are referred to as synaptic plasticity. Although, this type of microanatomical plasticity has been associated with drug addiction or even with autism, the change in the morphology and density of spines in addiction, autism and in neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear. Recent developments of high-resolution confocal single photon and multi-photon microscopy, together with the ability to mark subcellular structures, provide a new window for the observation of live single or small groups of neurons which never existed before. However, extracting useful information using this novel imaging is a challenging task. In particular, observing the variations of spine populations, which are in the order of several thousands for even a single neuron, categorizing them in different types and maintaining the timeline of changes are largely laborious manual tasks that are subject to the inevitable inaccuracies native to repetitive and tedious manual work.\r\n\r\nOur project aims to develop the algorithmic foundations for a new generation of software tools for extracting global spine morphometric characteristics and population dynamics from high-resolution confocal single photon and multi-photon microscopy images with minimal human intervention. Such tools will have a transformative effect in the logistics of spine studies, because they slash the required labor cost. To achieve our goal, we will make contributions to both mathematical analysis and computer vision. We aim to develop robust methods for the detection, identification of type and estimation of volume regardless of the position and spatial orientation of spines in a 3D image of a neuron acquired with the said microscopes. Finally, our project offers educational opportunities to graduate students in a blend of abstract and computational mathematics and computer vision. We also plan to continue our outreach activities to local high schools located in disadvantaged areas of Houston, offering to top students sneak peeks of the life of the mathematician, the computer scientist and the biologist researcher.",

This exploration, which started essentially in the 19th century, became only realizable in the last 50 years due to the development of the electron microscope and electrophysiology methods. Although electron microscope affords us with extreme resolution enough to inspect even the most minute structures at sub cellular level, limits us to the study of non-living tissue. More recent developments in imaging instrumentation during the last 12 years, made available a new generation of microscopes which essentially work like scanners, and exploit a natural property of tissue called fluorescence. With these new laser microscopes we can explore living tissue either in-vitro cultures or by putting sedated small live mammals under the microscope. Thus, a whole new generation of images becomes available to neuroscientists, to explore not only the anatomical structure of neuronal cells but also the function at the single cellular level or in small groups of neurons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work in this project focused on the development of tools for the analysis of these kinds of images with special emphasis on the generation of digital images of groups of neurons, the identification of their dendritic arbors, axons, and somas. Moreover, we developed an almost fully automated method for the extraction and detection of sub cellular structures playing a key role in synaptic function, the dendritic spines. These&nbsp;&nbsp; are small protrusions emanating from the surface of dendritic branches. They work as terminals at the receiving end of synapses. Dendritic spine populations change over time, and their density plays a key role in modern studies of aiming to establish their role in the regulation of synaptic function in a series of neurological conditions such as autism, bipolar disorder, chemical dependence, and schizophrenia. Spines are anatomically, sub cellular compartments of neural cells. They can be generated in a matter of a few minutes and disappear a few hours after their birth.

We can create metadata of the graph structure of dendritic arbors and include the locations of spines in three-dimensional coordinates. Moreover, the algorithms we created in the course of this project paved the pathway for the development of new computational tools for measuring the interaction between axons and dendritic arbors of neighboring neural cells, and to assess how these can be modified by means of neurodegeneration reversion drugs. The advantage that image analysis tools like ours, is that they enable scientists to observe the longitudinal connection between synaptic network anatomy and function, and its modifications due to learning or pharmaceutical interventions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The development of these computational tools was a result of novel achievements in the domain of Computational Harmonic Analysis. In particular, we invented new geometric metrics which can distinguish more round or oval-shaped 3D structures from tubular ones, regardless of their position in the 3D space. We also studied the development of sensitive filters, which can identify the surface of neuronal cells independently of their positioning in the interior of a 3D image of a group of neurons. Our spine detection tool mimics the function of an omnidirectional second-order derivative and it, thus, becomes a sensitive filter to dendritic surface anomalies. Our algorithms developed hand-in hand with new mathematical theories which aim in establishing why these algorithms work. All of our findings have been made available to the scientific community, in the form of open source, free to use, software with basic documentation, with publications in peer-reviewed journals, and with presentations in key conferences. Last but not least, our work on the processing of weak images of cultured neurons, where the visibility of neuronal structure has been degraded, due to light attenuation, led to the development of a new mathematical theory for the modeling and the elimination of shadow and glare effects from natural images. This new approach to the visibility effects due to variations of illumination led us to the development of algorithms for visibility restoration in natural images will be commercialized by a startup company in which the University of Houston holds a significant interest. The first application domain of this commercial effort is the enhancement of marine video acquired in poor visibility conditions by submersible vehicles or divers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last, the project generated numerous educational opportunities for doctoral students and two postdoctoral fellows.
