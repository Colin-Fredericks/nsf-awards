 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate techniques to power cellular network base stations from renewable sources (wind turbines and photovoltaic modules) in order to address cellular networks' carbon footprint and resiliency concerns. To better manage operation and increase resiliency, base stations are clustered in small groups in a microgrid configuration. In this configuration, cellular traffic management is integrated with the operation of local renewable electric power generators and energy storage, forming a single power and communication sustainable smart infrastructure system. Consequently, this project will develop an integrated management system by (a) researching algorithms that use next-day weather forecasts to predict the short-term available renewable energy; (b) studying algorithms to predict the cellular traffic-dependent power consumption; and (c) investigating algorithms that will integrate the information from (a) and (b) to shape the traffic at base stations to maximize operation powered from renewable sources while also maintaining communication quality within limits.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes from this project will help overcome barriers challenging the use of renewable energy and will increase the resiliency of cellular networks to allow continued operation under extreme events. Also, the outcomes from this project will be of value in other applications, such as demand-response and sustainable operation of data centers and other networks. This project will also implement a course, to be co-taught by the investigators through virtual meetings, that integrates technology in computing, communications and power systems to address the scarcity of graduating professionals with an understanding of the smart grid as a system integrating power, computational and communications notions.",

The power that is consumed by a cellular base station grows as its traffic increases. At the same time, systems that are powered from common types of renewable energy (solar and wind) need a power consumption management system to handle their variable energy availability (due to weather and day/night cycles). In this project, the issues limiting the use of renewable energy were addressed by integrating the management of cellular traffic with generated power and stored energy. To enable joint energy and cellular traffic management, we introduced the concept of a &ldquo;Sustainable Wireless Area&rdquo; (SWA), which consists of a self-contained and independently controlled local power grid&mdash;called microgrid&mdash;composed of nearby interconnected base stations and electric power generators based on renewable energy. Furthermore, we developed algorithms for the SWA architecture that use the predicted availability of renewable energy over the following 24 hours to shape the volume of traffic through the base station. When it is predicted a deficit in the availability of renewable energy, the management algorithms reduce the volume of traffic through the base station. Because a reduction in the volume of traffic affects the quality of the service experienced by end users (perceived as lower quality for video or higher delay for data traffic), the developed algorithms need to manage the tradeoff between the reduction in service quality and the increase of time the base station is powered from renewable energy. As a result, the developed algorithms achieve longer periods of operation powered from renewable energy while degradation of the users' Quality-of-Experience (QoE) is minimal and occasional.</p>\n<p>In addition, our research has shown that the SWA architecture increases resilience of cellular networks. This is because the operation of cellular networks is disrupted more frequently from events associated to the infrastructures that provide power. The technology developed in this project increases cellular networks resiliency by extending the time that the SWA can operate without depending on lifelines infrastructures to provide power.</p>\n<p>The outcomes from this project transcend its application to cellular networks because they provide a framework for how a microgrid power architecture enable an integrated management of energy and load. Because in microgrids the generators, controllers and loads are located within close vicinity, it becomes possible to adapt the operation of the load based on the current or projected status for the energy subsystem. In addition, the integration of short-term, high-resolution renewable energy availability with the control of the load provides a framework for the design of system powered from renewable energy that is general enough that it could be applied to other applications. Following this perspective, this project has allowed us to study techniques to increase data centers resiliency to events that disrupt their electric power supply.</p>\n<p>The research in this project belongs within a larger framework of developing a sustainable and resilient &ldquo;Smart Grid&rdquo;. As such, this project research is distinctly cross-disciplinary, involving power systems, communication and computing disciplines. This cross-disciplinary nature of the knowledge involved with smart grids development presents a challenge from the perspective of forming a qualified workforce able to design, build and operate such smart grids. This challenge was addressed in this project through the design and delivery of a graduate-level course on &ldquo;Cyber-Physical Power Systems&rdquo;. The goal of this course is to educate graduate students in electrical and computer engineering programs on the multidisciplinary issues and technologies broadly associated with the Smart Grid. The course was offered for the first time in the fall of 2015, co-taught simultaneously by the two Principal Investigators at their Universities. As a result, this project has helped in forming engineers with a comprehensive formation in cyber-physical power systems.
