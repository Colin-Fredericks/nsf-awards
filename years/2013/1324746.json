 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for participation in the conference \"Type Theory,\r\nHomotopy Theory and Univalent Foundations\", at the Centre de\r\nRecerca Matematica in Barcelona (Spain), September 23-27, 2013.\r\nThe grant will enable selected mathematicians affiliated with U.S.\r\ninstitutions to participate in the conference.  The allocation\r\nof funds will favor graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty,\r\nand faculty with no current NSF support.\r\n\r\nThe topic of the conference are the recent connections\r\ndiscovered between type theory and homotopy theory based on the\r\ninterpretation of identity types as path spaces.  These\r\nconnections provide a new topological intuition that facilitates\r\nworking with type theories and allow for new computational tools\r\nfor manipulating homotopy-theoretic structures.  Furthermore,\r\nVoevodsky's Univalent Foundations program provides a solid\r\nlogical basis for the practice of identifying isomorphic\r\nstructures, common throughout mathematics even if it is not\r\nallowed by standard set-theoretic foundations.\r\n\r\nThe topic of the conference has an unusually wide impact since\r\nit involves several areas: mathematical logic, theoretical\r\ncomputer science, homotopy theory and category theory.  In\r\nparticular, the developments offer a new perspective on\r\ncomputer-assisted formalization of mathematical proofs and\r\nverification of their correctness, which promises to benefit all\r\nmathematical endeavor, and further influence on design of\r\nprogramming languages.\r\n\r\nConference web page: http://www.crm.cat/2013/ctype",
