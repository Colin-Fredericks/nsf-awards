 "awd_abstract_narration": "1323192\r\nPI: Lepek\r\n\r\nThis proposal will help subsidize travel-related expenses to enable U.S. researchers, particularly early-career researchers such as the PI, to attend and present their research at the Fluidization XIV conference (Fluidization XIV: From Fundamentals to Products) in Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands (May 25-30, 2013).  This proposal will support researchers from U.S. institutions that would normally not have the financial resources necessary to attend this international conference.   In addition, this proposal will help support the travel costs of early-career researchers and researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM fields that will be recruited to participate in this conference. \r\n\r\nFluidization is a very important field of both fundamental research and broad industrial applications.  Currently, knowledge of complex fluid-particle interactions, particularly when coupled with multiphase transport phenomena and chemical reactions is still incomplete.  This is primarily due to the challenges associated with coupling the solid properties of particles and their hydrodynamic behavior within a moving fluid medium.  The addition of heat and mass transfer operations and also chemical reacting systems makes multiphase systems such as fluidized bed reactors a challenge to successfully design, scale-up, and operate.  Although fluidized bed reactors are fairly common within the petrochemical industry, they can be found in other industries for a variety of applications such as coating and the design of new materials.   Therefore, advances in fluidization research are necessary to help develop and ultimately commercialize new technologies such as CO2 capture (chemical looping), renewable energy systems, nanostructured materials, and the continuous processing of novel coated drug delivery systems.  This conference will focus on advances in the field of fluidization research which impact the research and development, as well as the large-scale manufacturing of advanced materials that are common across a wide range of chemical process, life science, and food science industries.  \r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together a wide range of scientists and engineers across multiple continents that are focused on fluidization research, which can have a major impact on multiple industries.  By bringing together researchers who share a mutual interest in fluidization, it is expected that new international partnerships and collaborations will be established.  This will be especially beneficial to the early-career researchers supported by this proposal that will have the unique opportunity to present their recent unpublished research findings in front of a congregation of established international researchers.",

In spite of research over last several decades, significant challenges still exist in this field, in areas such as reactor design and modeling and simulation.  Advances in this field are necessary to ultimately commercialize new technologies and are particularly vital to industry.  This project enabled early-career US researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured assistant professors) to be exposed to cutting-edge advances in the fluidization field and allowed for international networking to further their careers.  The project resulted in six papers peer-reviewed published in conference proceedings.  The proceedings were disseminated to all participants and are available to the public at the conference website.

The participants were also exposed to current advances in global industries by attending industrially-sponsored trips at refineries and chemical plants.  In conclusion, the project not only advanced the research careers of the US researhers, but also helped to strengthen international relations between US and foreign researchers in the field of fluidization.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Lepek"
