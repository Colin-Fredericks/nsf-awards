 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis and Chemistry of Life Processes Programs of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Eric Block of the Department of Chemistry at the University at Albany, SUNY, will conduct basic research on several areas of organo-sulfur and -selenium chemistry, e.g., 1) Research on low molecular weight organoselenium compounds related to methaneselenol, a central player in human Se metabolism and the anticancer activity of dietary Se;  2) Research on olfaction, following up on the discovery of the role of copper in smelling volatile sulfur compounds;  3) Research on thiacorannulenes, unusual, bowl-shaped compounds with potential utility in design of metal catalysts and materials for energy storage;  4) Research on the chemistry of garlic and onion, emphasizing discovery of novel, biologically active sulfur containing, natural-products. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to answer fundamental questions on the chemistry of these important elements in synthetic organic and pharmaceutical chemistry, and biochemistry.  Each aim was chosen because of the broad intellectual challenge presented in the execution of the work, the paucity of knowledge in each area (e.g., metabolism of small organoselenium compounds; olfactory receptors for volatile sulfur-containing molecules; metal-coordination to unusual ligands; garlic-inspired drugs), and the likelihood of significant discoveries resulting from work in each area.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

It has been proposed that humans can sense more than one trillion different odors. These odors range from the sublime to the repugnant: from floral fragrances and enticing aromas of food and beverages to the malodors of&nbsp;spoiled food,&nbsp;halitosis, leaking natural gas, smoke and airborne pollutants.&nbsp;For animals, by signaling the existence of predators and prey, potential mates and food, odorants provide critical information for survival.

Molecular vibrations for deuterium are notably different than those of normal hydrogen. Thus, our observation that olfactory receptors highly responsive to musks fail to discriminate between normal and deuterium-labeled musks renders the \"vibration theory\" implausible. Instead our modeling suggests that the carbonyl group oxygen present in musks, such as muscone from the musk deer (shown below; oxygen colored red), forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl (OH) group of the amino acid tyrosine found in the binding pocket of musk olfactory receptors (a hydrophilic interaction). At the same time the hydrophobic carbon-hydrogen region of muscone interacts with the similarly hydrophobic benzene rings attached to three&nbsp;phenylalanines, which are also found in the&nbsp;binding pocket. Thus, our research suggests a modified \"docking\" or \"molecular recognition\" theory of olfaction, similar to the model whereby enzymes recognize their substrates (similar, but not identical, to the \"lock and key\" model of molecular complementarity advocated by Nobel Laureates Linus Pauling and Emil Fischer).</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"../MBRender?repoid={F317415C-6952-4594-8440-ED81F65991D9}&amp;finish=ImgEditPreview\" alt=\"Muscone\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Muscone</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have also studied olfactory receptors that are highly responsive to sulfur compounds (mercaptans or thiols) such as those used to odorize natural gas (and released by skunks), for example <em>tert</em>-butyl mercaptan (shown below; sulfur colored yellow).
