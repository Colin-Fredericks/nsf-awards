 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary organizations are inherently participatory -- especially those that depend on the Internet as part of their functioning. Unlike older forms of organization, such \"virtual organizations\" have the distinguishing feature that organizational boundaries can be easily flexed or dissolved, allowing the inclusion of new people and the adoption of new practices broadly understood to be more participatory, open and transparent.  Such a feature is not restricted to \"cyberinfrastructures\" but is part of a much more general, but still only poorly understood, social phenomena highlighted by press accounts of the democratizing and/or exploitative power of the Internet.  This project explores the nature and effects of such public participation on contemporary organizations.  The goal is to determine which kinds of participation are most beneficial for innovation and legitimation, as well as what kinds of threats participation might pose, and for whom.  To address these questions, the project will collect and analyze a large number of ethnographic case studies, using an innovative software environment for collaborative qualitative research.\r\n \r\nThe project poses three questions:  1. How does the ontogeny of a virtual organization affect conceptions and practices of participation?  2. How do new socio-technical systems (e.g. the Internet) transform participation in Science, Technology Engineering and Medicine (STEM) over time?  3. What is the relationship between the quality of participation and the quality of resource creation, curation and re-use?   The research uses and extends a database of over 110 rich case studies of participation, and a software tool for evaluating participation across multiple cases.  For question 1 we add new detail to these case studies, based on themes that have emerged from previous research; for question 2 we add cases of pre-Internet forms of participation, to explore more precisely the effects of technological change; and for question 3 we explore a new set of cases that focus on data as a valuable resource.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreased public participation is often seen as a means to increase the effectiveness and legitimacy of research and innovation.  And the internet has been heralded as the participatory technology par excellence that can achieve these goals.   This NSF research project studied actually existing \"internet-enabled\" projects (websites, apps, platforms, software, mobile devices, etc.) designed to improve participatiom. We asked: do they succeed? For whom and for which purposes?  What kind of participation do they enable, and what does it mean?   We focused especially on science and technology (e.g. \"citizen science\") but we expanded our view to include many other domains: software, fan culture, citizen science and citizen journalism, crowdsourcing, political activism, with a particular focus on genetics and bio-medicine.\n\nWe found that despite this enthusiasm for participation, it is rarely clear what people mean by this idea, and that when it is used to design internet platforms, it rarely achieves the goals set out for it.  The core of our research project was an analysis of over 100 case studies of participation from a range of different domains.  We created \"thin\" cases studies that answered a number of questions related to participation, such as \"do participants get to participate in decision-making, or only in performing pre-set tasks?\" and \"does participation allow people to feel like part of a collective, or do they remain isolated individuals?\"  By evaluating these cases we were able to see some clusters that represented some broad trends in what people mean by participation, and how participation is \"designed into\" new technologies.\n\nThe most signficant difference was between  what we called \"rational-direct\" and \"experiential-affective\" forms of participation.  The former includes projects that actively sought to enhance the capacity for decision-making and voice, or control over resources; and the latter includes projects that sought to enhance the collective emotional or cognitive experience of being a participant in something.   Cases like Wikipedia and Free/Open Source software often were more \"radical-direct\", whereas cases like Zooniverse, YouTube, or PatientsLikeMe were more \"experiential-affective.  Some cases enhanced decision-making without providing a sense of involvement or inclusion (e.g. crowdsourcing sites); others created an experience of participation, but only at the expense of extracting time, data or money from people, who were not allowed much or any control over it.  The implication of this distinction for future research is that participation does not always come in the same form---and both normative demands for it, and critical rejections of it (as \"co-optation\" for instance) can miss the specificity of what is being achieved if it is not more clearly labeled and analyzed.  Our project has established a base-line for trying to evaluate and measure what forms of participation are actually occurring, and with what frequency, in different local or global contexts. \n\nParticipation is also implicitly and explicitly associated with democracy and democratization.  Sometimes it is critiqued for a failure to live up to the norms of democracy. However, few people ask how participation can itself contribute to anti-democratic projects, or projects explicitly focused on decreasing equality.   In order to research this issue, we looked at one particular group of people who fit this description: white nationalists and neo-nazis.  In particular we asked:  how do white nationalists use the tools of 'direct to consoumer' genetic ancestry tests, and what do they do with the results?  These users often take and discuss genetic ancestry tests, and often are informed by such tests that they are not (purely) white.  By analyzing forums where such discussions happen online, we were able to establish the range of \"repair practices\" such individuals engage in, as part of an open, participatory science of genetic ancestry.  Far from being simply ignorant about genetics, we find that they engage in sometimes sophisticated attempts to re-interpret genetics to fit their views of race and inequality.  This research can help understand how genetics and genetic ancestry testing does not always achieve its goal of improving understandings of science, or of eliminating racism or racially-based assumptions about biology, but rather can also sometimes become a new resource for beliefs that are anathema to democracy and science.\n\nMajor publications that have emerged from this project include the following:\n\n\nKelty, Christopher and Seth Erickson. 2018. \"Two modes of participation: A conceptual analysis of 102 cases of internet and social media participation from 2005&ndash;2015.\" The Information Society. 34(X):xx-xx.  https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2017.1414092\n\nKelty, Christopher, and Aaron Panofsky. 2014. \"Disentangling Public Participation In Science and Biomedicine.\" Genome medicine 6:8.https://doi.org/10.1186/gm525 \n\nKelty, Christopher et al. 2014. \"Seven dimensions of contemporary participation disentangled.\" Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. 66(3):474-488 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asi.23202 \n\nKelty, Christopher M. 2013. \"From Participation to Power.\" Pp. 22&ndash;32 in Participatory Cultures Handbook, edited by Aaron Delwiche and Jennifer Henderson.
