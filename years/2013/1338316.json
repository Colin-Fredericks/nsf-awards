Mark Leckie, Univ. Massachusetts, Amherst, EAR-1338317\r\nJulio Sepulveda, MIT, EAR-1338318\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThe expansion of oxygen-deficient waters, known as hypoxia, is occurring seasonally in places such as the Gulf of Mexico as a result of warming and pollution.  Hypoxia can affect all marine organisms through the loss of habitat, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and availability of nutrients for primary production. Ocean acidification resulting from the input of anthropogenic CO2 is already impacting the ability of many organisms to grow shells.  The geological record contains a series of natural experiments that allow us to address the biological response of the biota to ocean acidification and widespread oxygen deficiency. \r\n\r\nThe Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (94 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous Period), a time interval marked by mass extinction, was also characterized by global oxygen deficiency and likely ocean acidification.  Thus, the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is an excellent ancient model for the impact of anthropogenic activities on marine ecosystems.  A superb opportunity exits to explore the impact of oxygen deficiency and ocean acidification during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary in rock outcrops from the western and southern margins of the US Western Interior Seaway.  In Utah, rocks contain original ammonite aragonite as well as remains of large marine reptiles.  In Texas, British Petroleum has made available a unique core and exclusive access to outcrop sections.  Back-hoeing of rock outcrops will unearth pristine fossil shells suitable for reconstruction of ancient environmental conditions using geological proxies, and coring will provide rocks that can be studied to determine changes that took place over centuries. The insight gained from the CTB can be applied to other intervals of biotic upheaval in Earth history and will help improve projections of the impacts of human activities, including hypoxia and ocean acidification, on modern ecosystems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNinety-three million years ago during the Cretaceous period, one of the warmest times in Earth history, sea level was hundreds of meters higher than at present.  These elevated waters flooded the interior of the US continent from Texas to the Arctic Ocean.  Geologists have long been exploring the treasure trove of fossils in this Western Interior Seaway and they give us a glimpse of life during the ancient interval of extreme warmth.  At the height of this warmth the global ocean was impacted by a severe interval of oxygen deficiency, known as an anoxic event, that led to the deposition of petroleum source rocks in parts of the oceans.  The goal of our project was to determine how life responded to the extreme warmth as well as ocean anoxia.  In particular, we focused on a group of algae, the calcareous nannoplankton, that produce intricate shells and allow us to determine the health of the base of the marine food chain.  These fossils offer clues as to whether the anoxic event was triggered by increased ocean stratification and poor ventilation, or by an increase in the input of nutrients possibly associated with volcanism.  Our paleontological study was combined with an ocean model to develop a better understanding of the circulation in the seaway, and with geochemical studies to constrain the input of material from volcanoes along the western edge of the seaway.  The basis of our study was a 130-meter long core that we extracted in southern Utah that contains a pristine record of life in the coastal ocean across this unique interval of geologic time. \n\nOur results show that life thrived across the entire interval of extreme warmth, but in fact that the western part of the seaway warmed then become cooler as the flow of waters from the Arctic Ocean intensified.  This switch in circulation is also observed in the model simulations.  The anoxic event corresponds to intensified ocean stratification as suggested by plankton and an increase in the input of volcanic material as indicated by geochemistry, rather than a surge in surface nutrients.  This is different from the modern coastal ocean where oxygen deficiency generally accompanies elevated production associated with input of nutrients from rivers.  Thus, we conclude that the volcanism led to anoxia via input of greenhouse gas and warming rather than by fertilizing the ocean. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy J Bralower"
