 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) \r\nIIP-1266013; Clemson University; William Ferrell \r\nIIP-1265999; Virginia Tech; Kimberly Ellis \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to renew the participation of Clemson University and Virginia Tech in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) for another five years (Phase II). The lead institution is the University of Arkansas (Phase III), and at present also includes the Oklahoma State University, the University of Missouri, Arizona State and the University of California, Berkeley. \r\n\r\nThe Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that works with its member organizations to address complex research problems in logistics and distribution. The mission of CELDi is to enable member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by developing meaningful, innovative, and implementable solutions that provide a significant return on investment. CELDi delivers on the I/UCRC promise of high-yield results by exploiting leveraging and synergy in multiple funding sources like individual member organizations, a pool of member organization fees, and competitive funding from the NSF to conduct both specific and generalized, basic research. In addition, CELDi provides the foundation and structure for educating the next generation of engineers in logistics and distribution systems. \r\n\r\nThere are two important broader impacts of CELDi. The first is that the Center has developed a model for applied research conducted within member facilities and focused on operational issues that produce academically relevant scholarship and successfully transfer results to assist the members in achieving logistics and distribution excellence. The second is the impact on students. The Center has created a number of mechanisms to develop student researcher skills including one-on-one mentoring sessions, group mentoring sessions, a best-poster contest judged by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), and ensuring more informal interactions occur between students and the IAB by pairing for lunch and roundtable discussions. The Center also intends to continue its efforts to increase the pool of talented students from under-represented groups by actively recruiting and engaging such students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF I/UCR Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is a consortium of university and industry members dedicated to improving logistics through applied research.  CELDi research is a combination of directed projects, center directed projects, and NSF fundamental research projects.  Directed projects are the cornerstone of the membership and utilize a team of faculty and student researchers along with industry researchers employed at a member company to address a specific problem at that company.  The center directed projects use money pooled from each membership to have a university-based research team address a problem of interest to many of the industry members.  Finally, the NSF fundamental research project is a separate solicitation available to university members to address a more basic research problem.\n\nThe Clemson Research site of CELDi participated in all three types of projects.  Directed projects were completed for several companies located near Clemson.  Each project had a demonstrably positive impact on the company?s operation and all three companies used the research results from other directed projects to improve operations and leverage their membership &ndash; a cornerstone of the CELDi value proposition.  Clemson researchers and graduate students also completed a Center Directed Project on the use of optimization models to detect fraudulent reporting in systems like machine maintenance or incoming quality.  Clemson researchers and graduate students also completed a Fundamental Research Project in collaboration with the University of Arkansas, VA Tech, and UC Berkeley that focused on operational issues surrounding the Physical Internet and collaborative logistics. Details of results were detailed in the final NSF report associated with this project.  These projects motivated research that generated a number of publications and presentations at CELDi meetings and nation-wide conferences.\n\nFinally, Clemson received a Research Experience for Undergraduates award that allowed a team of three undergrads to conduct research on collaborative logistics.  The team explored the operations and business models of collaborative transportation like uber-trucking and collaborative warehousing.  All three students indicated this experience was very positive and will have influence as they make career decisions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William G Ferrell"
