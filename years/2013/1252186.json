 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent great earthquakes and ensuing tsunamis in Sumatra, Chile and Japan have demonstrated the need for accurate ground displacements that fully characterize the great amplitudes and broad dynamic range associated with these vast, complex ruptures. Our ability to model these events, whether in real-time or after the fact, is limited by the weaknesses of both seismic and geodetic networks. Geodetic instruments provide the static component as well as coarse dynamic motions but are much less precise than seismic instruments, especially in the vertical direction. Seismic instruments, in turn, provide exceptionally-sensitive dynamic motions but typically have difficulty recovering unbiased near-field static offsets and low-frequency motions because of contamination, for example, from instrument tilt. This three-year project is demonstrating a new paradigm for studying the processes of large earthquakes and the hazards they pose.  Accurate three-dimensional seismogeodetic waveforms (broadband displacements and velocities) that span the full spectrum of seismic motion will be achieved through integration of geodetic and seismic measurements instrumentation developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The main science objectives are to improve finite-fault slip inversions through the optimal combination of geodetic and seismic data at the observational level and to investigate appropriate methodologies to perform full waveform inversions using the resulting data. With UNAVCO engineers, a test bed of integrated GPS/seismic stations is being established at existing real-time Plate Boundary Observatory stations along the southern San Andreas fault system as a prototype for further expansion along the Western North America plate margin. The stations are being upgraded with low-cost MEMS accelerometers and a Geodetic Module that will synchronize the GPS and accelerometer data and estimate seismogeodetic displacements and velocities.\r\n\r\nThe project is installing and testing seismic upgrades to existing GPS monitoring stations for improved response to and modeling and understanding of large earthquakes and ensuing tsunamis, such as recent ones in Sumatra, Chile and Japan. The broader impacts of this project are significant in terms of scientific value, engineering infrastructure, civilian use, and economic impact, and are related for the most part to the real-time nature and capabilities of enhanced GPS/seismic monitoring. The new observations contribute directly to natural hazards research and early warning systems for earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis, to atmospheric research including short-term weather forecasting and related flooding hazards, and to earthquake engineering research for large structures (e.g., bridges, buildings, dams). The ultimate goal is to save lives and minimize damage to essential infrastructure. The new observations also contribute to civilian applications requiring precise real-time positioning (e.g., surveying, geographic information systems, agriculture) and hence to economic stimulus. Finally, the project supports collaborative and interdisciplinary research, education of technologically sophisticated graduate students, strengthening of diversity in support of workforce development, and enhancement of curricula at a variety of levels through engagement new types of data sets that have direct societal impact.",

The contribution of GPS is that it directly measures the permanent displacements (motions) of these stations over time. This information is used to infer the stresses that build up in the crust that periodically cause earthquakes. This is part of the earthquake cycle consisting of a long period of steady &ldquo;interseisimic&rdquo; motion, punctuated by an earthquake (&ldquo;coseismic motion&rdquo;), and a period of crustal relaxation (&ldquo;postseismic motion&rdquo;) until the crust returns to its steady motion. Complementary to GPS are seismic stations including seismometers and accelerometers that record the ground shaking during an earthquake, but not the permanent displacements measured by GPS. GPS can also record the shaking but not as precisely as seismic instruments. Seismic instruments have a problem of rapidly and accurately measuring the magnitude of a large earthquake, a phenomena called magnitude saturation that does not affect GPS instruments. Earthquake magnitude is a critical parameter for earthquake and tsunami early warning systems whose purpose is to warn local populations that strong earth shaking or tsunami inundation is imminent. Both GPS and seismic instruments are useful for building these systems and in particular in combination using a method called seismogeodesy, which require that the instruments be collocated, that is at the same location. Due to historical reasons, geodetic and seismic networks have been established independently so that stations with both types of instruments are few. Our project has focused on developing an inexpensive way to upgrade the existing GPS monitoring systems with low-cost MEMS (Microelectromechanical) accelerometers. We have shown that the optimal combination of GPS and MEMS accelerometer data provides an instrument that takes advantage of the strengths of each type of data and can be just as useful as much more expensive seismic instruments for early warning applications.
