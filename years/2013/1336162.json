The objective of this work is to facilitate the accomplishment of the ultimate goal of fire retardancy, extensive charring of the polymer matrix, which means that the polymer can be used at the service temperature, whereas in case of fire, it would rapidly char, limiting the production of combustible volatiles.  This will be accomplished by forming new polymer nanocomposites which show synergistic effects of the two types of nanofillers: one forms a physical barrier and the other catalytically chars the polymer by changing its degradation pathway during burning.  In view of the lack of qualitative and quantitative understanding of the fire retardant mechanism of each type of nanofiller, this research will focus on studying the kinetics and the mass and heat transfer processes involved in the burning of the polymer with and without the nanofillers, qualitatively using thermal analysis and quantitatively using cone-calorimeter experiments.  \r\n\r\nThe new knowledge generated would be disseminated through publications, book sections, and fire safety courses at Texas A&M University and Oklahoma State University.  The broad impact of this research is twofold, such that it would contribute to better understanding of the role of nanofillers in fire retardancy at the fundamental level and at the same time give a practical insight on the development of new and better fire retardant materials with the potential of replacing existing materials, providing enough time for timely evacuation and timely control of fires due to less heat release.",
