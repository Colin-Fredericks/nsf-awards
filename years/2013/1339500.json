 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative multi-instrument investigation of the high-latitude geospace system will be carried out, motivated by the completion of the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars RISR-N and RISR-C, the first ever ISRs deployed to the geomagnetic polar regions. Initial results from RISR-N have revealed an unexpectedly structured and dynamic plasma environment. In order to understand these new measurements and to fully exploit this new diagnostic capability, an experimental campaign is proposed that will synthesize RISR observations with data from the collocated optical sensors (Fabry-Perot Interferometer and Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imager), the PolarDARN HF (high frequency) radars, the THEMIS and NORSTAR camera networks, and the global ISR network (in particular, Sondrestrom, the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), and the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT)). \r\n\r\nThis project will leverage the new diagnostic information provided by RISR to foster collaborative studies of the high latitude geospace system. The guiding questions of the investigation arise from this systems view: 1. What governs the internal structure and HF propagation characteristics of plasma density patches? 2. How do auroral processes affect structure and composition of the polar ionosphere, and what are the global-scale implications? 3. What are the important interactions between the plasma and neutral gases at polar latitudes? 4. How do the aforementioned processes control the distribution of plasma on high-latitude flux tubes? \r\n\r\nThis project will provide a wealth of information on the ionospheric boundary for modelers to enhance our understanding of the ionospheric boundary. The investigation of plasma structuring mechanisms will have implications for communications and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal propagation. The investigation of plasma-neutral interactions will shed light on how the lower atmosphere drives the global geospace system. The research will be carried out through an 8-institution international collaborative (4 from the U.S., 2 from Canada, 2 from Japan). The project will contribute to training the next generation of geophysicists, and the team will include three early career investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe sun interacts with our planet in two distinct ways.   One way is through the radiant heat and light we experience directly here on Earth.   The other is through the solar wind, the ever expanding outer atmosphere of the sun, which interacts with Earth?s outer atmosphere and magnetosphere, producing disturbances that adversely affect modern technologies and impact human society.   These \"space weather\" effects include corruption of GPS signals, disruption  of communication links, damage to orbiting spacecraft, modification of satellite orbits, and increased radiation compromising astronaut safety.  This project seeks to improve our understanding of the physics of space weather.  The particular focus is a new Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) system deployed, for the first time, to Earth?s geomagnetic polar region.    At the  geomagnetic poles, the converging magnetic field lines serve as a lens, focusing the energy produced by solar wind-magnetosphere interactions to a geographically confined region.   Although the polar region is critical to our understanding of space weather, deploying instrumentation in these regions is logistically challenging.  \n\nIn 2008, a new Incoherent Scatter Radar was completed at Resolute Bay, Canada, providing the first-ever direct measurements of Earth?s ionosphere (our ionized outer atmosphere in the 100 to 800 km altitude range) in a critical geomagnetic polar region.   The goal of this project was to exploit this new observational evidence to improve our understanding of how the energy of the impinging solar wind is transferred to the ionized and neutral gases of our outer atmosphere.   Our approach assimilated these new measurements with measurements from the existing sensor infrastructure through physics-based computer models of the energy transfer process.

This process constitutes an anomalous source of heating in the outer atmosphere.   (2) Observations of the deep ionospheric density depletions and extreme density gradients caused by direct solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.  This structuring mechanism has a substantial affect on the manner in which energy is transferred into the geospace system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Semeter"
