 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SuperMAG project obtains ground magnetic field observations from approximately 300 observatories around the world. The SuperMAG team subtracts baselines from the observed magnetic field vectors and then the data are normalized to a common coordinate system and cadence. SuperMAG provides a graphical interface and allows users to display the data. Registered users can download digital data. This project will continue operation of SuperMAG and enhance its capabilities. This grant provides one year of support for SuperMAG.\r\n\r\nSuperMAG team has involved and will continue to involve students in SuperMAG. SuperMAG  also contributes to the broader scientific community by providing data to scientific users.",
