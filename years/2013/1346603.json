 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultrasensitive magnetometers have a wide range of applications, ranging from tests of fundamental\r\nsymmetries in physics to mineral exploration in geology to the detection of explosives and\r\nlandmines in national security. In particular, a magnetometer with femto-Tesla (fT or 10E-15\r\nTesla) magnetic field sensitivity can be used to image brain magnetic fields and study brain\r\nactivities (magnetoencephalography or MEG). Using the EAGER Grant, we will develop the technological base for future developments of single fiber based non-cryogenic low cost MEG systems as well as magnetic microscopes, both with ultra-high sensitivity and ultra-fast frame rate. These will help us to understand\r\nbrain circuitry at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Intellectual Merit: The loopless fiber-optic Sagnac interferometer was co- developed by the PI and has demonstrated unprecedented Faraday sensitivity even at DC. In this project, this technique will be used for the first time to improve the sensitivity of SERF magnetometer towards its quantum limit, surpassing any existing magnetometers. As a result of the intrinsic fiber-optic design, the sensor end of the magnetometer can be positioned at will, and can be miniaturized to chip level for observing neural activities of single cells. \r\nBroader Impacts: This project will help to develop novel scientific tools for elucidation of brain circuitry mechanism, and will make MEG cheaper thus more accessible for various functional brain disorder diagnosis. The project will provide integrated and rigorous trainings for graduate and undergraduate students of quantum physics, opto-electronics, biophysics and scientific communication. It will also contribute to the development of several courses the PI teaches at UCI. Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to take part in both research and outreach activities",
