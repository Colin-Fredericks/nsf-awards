 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyanobacteria are often associated with microbial assemblages called biofilms that can cause fouling of industrial surfaces, but can also be beneficial, e.g., in water purification processes. Despite the environmental prevalence and economic consequences of cyanobacterial biofilms, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of these structures have received little attention. The current proposal uses molecular genetics and sophisticated molecular and chemical techniques to understand the regulation of biofilm formation in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. Recent data suggest that the project will characterize a secreted inhibitor of biofilm formation, identify mechanisms of sensing the inhibitor, and determine the pathways for producing a biofilm in S. elongatus. Understanding this natural biofilm-inhibition system will be useful in designing strategies to minimize damage from detrimental biofilms and to elicit the formation of beneficial cyanobacterial biofilms. The project will train students from US and Israeli labs in microbiology, deep sequencing, and cutting-edge imaging technologies. The project will generate genetic tools and strains that will be made available to the research community, and any useful intellectual property that emerges from the work will be disclosed for commercialization.  As part of the ICOB program it will also establish international research collaborations with Israel.",

It is necessary to understand the regulation of biofilm formation in order to manage the process. There has been a great of research over the past 20 years about biofilm formation in bacteria that directly affect human health, such as those that form dental plaque, colonize medical devices, or cause infections in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. However, there was little information available about the biofilms made up of photosynthetic bacteria like cyanobacteria, which form in various ecosystems in the environment outside of human hosts. This project took advantage of some prior work that showed how to find the genes that code for proteins involved in biofilm formation. One lab in Israel and one in the US worked together to tackle the problem, with funding from both nations. The approach used a single-celled cyanobacterium called <em>Synechococcus elongatus</em>, which usually does not form biofilms in the lab. The Israeli partner had discovered previously that this bacterium does have the ability to form biofilms, but growth over decades in the lab had resulted in a variant that is constantly inhibiting biofilm formation. In other words, the bacterium should have the ability to turn biofilm formation on and off, but is stuck in the off mode. The Israeli partner had found that when one particular gene is inactivated, the &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch is broken and the variant now makes biofilms. The US lab had an extensive set of variants of <em>S. elongatus</em>, each missing one gene, and had developed many specialized techniques to study the organism. Putting these strengths together, the international team used approaches of genetics, genomics, and biochemistry to find many components of the network of cellular parts that are needed to form a biofilm. For example, a new approach enabled the monitoring of hundreds of thousands of different cells, each missing a different gene, to determine which genes make it more or less likely that the cells will form a biofilm.
