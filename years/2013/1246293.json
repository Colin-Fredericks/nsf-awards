 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change projections for this century suggest that the Southern Ocean will be the first region to be affected by seawater chemistry changes associated with enhanced carbon dioxide (CO2). Additionally, regions of the Southern Ocean are warming faster than any other locations on the planet. Ocean acidification and warming may act synergistically to impair the performance of different organisms by simultaneously increasing metabolic needs and reducing oxygen transport. However, no studies have measured krill acid-base regulation, metabolism, growth, or reproduction in the context of ocean acidification or synergistic 'greenhouse' conditions of elevated CO2 and temperature. In the present project, the investigators will conduct both short and prolonged exposure experiments at Palmer Station, Antarctica to determine the responses of Euphausia superba to elevated CO2 and temperature. The investigators will test hypotheses related to acid-base compensation and acclimation of various life stages of krill to elevated CO2 and temperature. Furthermore, they will determine these impacts on feeding, respiration, metabolism, growth, and reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a key component of Antarctic food webs as they are a primary food source for many of the top predators in the Southern Ocean including baleen whales, seals, penguins, and other sea birds. This project will determine the responses of Antarctic krill exposed to elevated CO2 and temperature and whether or not krill have the capacity to fully compensate under future ocean conditions. The proposed field effort will be complemented by an extensive broader impact effort focused on bringing marine science to both rural and urban high school students in the Midwest (Kansas). The core educational objectives of this proposal are to 1) instruct students about potential careers in marine science, 2) engage students and promote their interest in the scientific process, critical thinking, and applications of science, mathematics, and technology, and 3) and increase student and teacher awareness and understanding of the oceans and global climate change, with special focus on the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Finally, this project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the production, analysis, presentation and publication of datasets.",

Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> can impact the metabolism, growth, and reproduction of marine organisms. Concurrently with ocean acidification, rapid warming in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region is occurring and is associated with an overall decline in primary, secondary, and higher trophic levels, including Antarctic krill (<em>Euphausia superba</em>), a key species in Antarctic food webs. Ocean acidification and warming may act together to impair animal performance, which could eventually negatively impact a krill population that has declined two-fold since the mid-1970s. However, no prior studies measured Antarctic krill metabolism, growth, or reproduction in the context of ocean acidification or synergistic &ldquo;greenhouse&rdquo; conditions of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Our study examined feeding, growth, and metabolic responses of Antarctic krill exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature. By conducting multiple laboratory experiments during two field seasons at Palmer Station, Antarctic, we illustrated high variability in responses of Antarctic krill to acidification. A comparison of krill exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>/temperature for short (48 hours) or extended (3 weeks) time periods prior to feeding experiments demonstrated that krill may have the ability to acclimate to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, but remained sensitive to elevated temperature or the interaction between elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature. Additionally, krill growth and metabolic rates were primarily impacted by elevated temperature, and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had a minimal impact. Results from this project suggest that juvenile and adult krill are relatively tolerant of high CO<sub>2</sub>. Instead, physiological impacts from warming temperatures were more pronounced and thus will likely outweigh any negative effects on krill physiology from future acidification in regions of Antarctic with rapid rates of warming. However, warming temperature had a more pronounced impact on krill physiology compared to acidification, suggesting continued warming in the WAP region, and potentially other Antarctic regions, will drive Antarctic krill response. Additionally, food supply likely plays a large role on how krill respond to environmental stressors. Low food concentration is an added stressor, while high food availability may aid Antarctic krill in successful acclimation to increases in temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>. Results from this project, combined with previous studies conducted by other research groups focused on ocean acidification impacts on Antarctic krill egg hatching success and larval development, provide a more complete picture of krill response during their multi-stage life cycle and as such contribute to greater understanding of potential trajectories of Antarctic krill health and abundance and potential associated feedbacks on the ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Our project included a strong broader impacts component that reached a wide audience in land-locked Kansas through a year-long initiative called Project PARKA (Planting AntaRctica in KAnsas; <a href=\"http://coseenow.net/project-parka/\">http://coseenow.net/project-parka/</a>).
