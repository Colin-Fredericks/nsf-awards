 "awd_abstract_narration": "1336913\r\nSutton\r\nThis project involves the acquisition of components to assemble an ultra-high-pulse-energy (300 mJ/pulse at 254 nm), tunable, narrow-linewidth (~ 30 MHz) UV laser system.  This instrument will be the primary component used within a UV filtered Rayleigh scattering (FRS) measurement system to investigate vaporization and gas-phase mixing processes within turbulent spray flows.  Subsequent experiments using the new UV laser and FRS system will target gas-phase thermometry in sooting hydrocarbon flames which will yield new information concerning soot transport and reaction chemistry.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the best known examples of turbulent sprays exist in energy conversion systems in which a liquid fuel issues into an oxidizing environment, evaporates, and mixes with the oxidizer before reacting.  Gas-phase mixing has not been studied extensively in multi-phase spray environments primarily due the co-existence of the liquid phase that makes the independent measurement of the vapor-phase concentration very difficult.  The PI will use the new high-energy UV laser (254 nm) in conjunction with an atomic mercury filter to perform UV FRS measurements for quantitative gas-phase measurements with minimal interference from the liquid-phase droplets. \r\n \r\nBroader impacts of the project are addressed by the fact that the majority of engineering systems operate with working mediums that consist of multiple phases.   In particular, spray flows are of significant interest in many applications including automotive engines, liquid-propellant rocket engines, industrial furnaces, and gas-turbines.  With a better understanding of the vaporization and gas-phase mixing processes, improvements in fuel injector and combustor design will be possible, resulting in an improved control over ignition and a potential for increased efficiency, increased stability, and decreased pollutant emissions.  In terms of research-related education, the proposed laser system will be used by post-doctoral researchers and undergraduate/graduate students to enhance their training in state-of-the art measurement techniques.  Our technological future depends on developing both new methodologies and a new workforce capable of tackling such complicated problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSystems such as engines and power plants typically rely on liquid fuels that, once injected as a \"spray\" into a combustion chamber, must disperse within an environment, evaporate, and mix with air before combustion occurs.  Proper control of these processes, especially the fuel vapor-air mixing, is very important for achieving repeatable ignition, combustion stability, high combustion efficiency, and low pollutant output.  To better understand these key processes and improve them, new measurement tools are much needed, especially in regions where both liquid fuel and gaseous fuel vapor co-exist.  Ideally, measurements should be \"non-intrusive\"; that is, the measurements should not rely on the insertion of physical probes as they can disturb the environment which is to be examined.  In this manner, optical and laser diagnostics are very valuable since light cannot disturb the processes of interest, but its interaction with matter can be detected and used to infer what is happening in the region.  To date, there have not been very many successful techniques that can measure the fuel vapor- air mixtures in regions that also have liquid droplets because the interaction of the light and droplets interferes with the attempted measurement of the gas-phase properties. \n\nThe research supported by this small-equipment award targeted the development of a special laser system that could be used in conjunction with a laser technique called \"Filtered Rayleigh Scattering\" or \"FRS\".  In FRS, an atomic or molecular filter is placed in front of a camera, which in combination with a narrowband laser, allows the blocking of light scattering from solid particles or liquid droplets, while allowing some of the gas-phase information to make it to the camera.  In this manner, FRS allows a discrimination between liquid-phase information and gas-phase information.  However, it is noted that not just any laser can be used; the laser output wavelength must overlap with that of the filter.  We are interested in using a mercury filter because it allows the highest suppression of background signals (i.e., the droplet scattering that we wish to avoid).  To overlap with the mercury filter, we need a high-energy laser operating at 254 nm.  Thus, the specific objective of this research was the development of an ultra-high-energy, narrowband laser operating in the ultraviolet (UV) regime at 254 nm, which in conjunction with an atomic mercury filter will enable a significantly improved version of FRS to quantitatively measure the fuel vapor concentrations in the presence of liquid droplets.  A successful outcome of this project is \"tool development\"; that is, the completion and testing of the laser system.  The use of the system to better understand sprays was not the goal of this small-equipment award, but will be a target of the investigator in future work with this completed instrument.\n\nThe final laser system design consisted of a unique \"hybrid\" system design which combined the near-infrared output from a gain-switched Nd:YAG-pumped, injection-seeded, cavity-locked, titanium:sapphire (Ti:Al2O3) laser at 762 nm; a flashlamp-pumped alexandrite amplifier stage which amplifies the output at 762 nm, and a set of harmonic generators to give 254 nm. The laser system takes advantage of the fact that alexandrite, when pumped by xenon flashlamps, will serve as an effective amplification medium of the near-IR output of the Ti:sapphire stage, thus greatly boosting the original 762-nm output.  This design also overcomes previous limitations of building a laser oscillator/amplifier in the near-IR region using a single gain medium.  The system was completed and after testing we found that we achieved (i) a single-frequency output at 762 nm; (ii) effective amplification at 762 nm; and (iii) desired single-frequency output at 254 nm for the UV FRS.  The laser system was found to be very stable where pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations were of the same order of the original pu..."
