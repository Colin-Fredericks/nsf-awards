 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan.   Each year, the REU program will provide ten students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program.   REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project. In addition, they are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of research seminars. To assist in their professional development, students also participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations.  At the end of the program, the students participate in a two-day REU symposium where they present their research results to their peers and faculty mentors. They also prepare written project reports that can lead to peer reviewed publications.  Research work is augmented by an extensive array of educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours, research seminars given by faculty, and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a major research department, the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan has a long history of promoting outstanding undergraduate research.  This award continues the long-running and successful REU Site hosted by the Department.  Over the three-year period covered by this award, the Department hosted a total of 37 students from a variety of institutions.  (Four of these 37 participated with outside funding.)\n\nThe primary goal of this REU Site is to provide a transformative research experience, especially to students with limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions, and to recruit a diverse set of students into the STEM fields.  Out of the 37 students covered by this award, 19 were female, 8 were underrepresented minorities, and 16 came from primarily undergraduate institutions.\n\nIn addition to a strong focus on meaningful research under the supervision of a world-class faculty mentor, the REU Site organized a wide variety of professional and enrichment activities.  These included weekly research seminars as well as workshops on giving presentations, applying to graduate school, preparing for the GRE and on the responsible conduct of research.  The students were also trained in laboratory safety and had the opportunity to take a machine shop course.  One of the highlights of the REU program was an overnight trip to Fermilab that included free time to explore downtown Chicago.\n\nMany program activities, including the REU Symposium held at the end of the summer, included students from the Biophysics and other REU programs as well as internal students at the University of Michigan.  This provided numerous opportunities for the students to interact and begin to build up a professional network and to frame their projects in the context of the overall environment at a major research university.\n\nBased on student surveys, this REU Site has been successful in having students gain confidence in performing research and in functioning independently in a laboratory setting.  As a group, the program has increased their desire to go to graduate school and pursue a research career.  Currently, 19 of the 37 students have gone on to PhD programs in Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James T Liu"
