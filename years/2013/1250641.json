Such deposits are interpreted to be emplaced by waning energy flows.  Massive units are macroscopically structureless, i.e. there is not a visible organization of sediment particles within the deposit.  In the laminated units, sediment particles of different size are deposited with visible patterns.\r\nThe main objective of this research is to investigate and model flow and sediment transport conditions that are responsible for the emplacement of massive and parallel laminated units.  Laboratory and field studies demonstrate that parallel laminated units are emplaced under sediment transport conditions known as upper plane bed regime.  These conditions are characterized by i) a moving bedload layer one or two grain diameters thick, and ii) downstream migrating low amplitude bedforms.  As the parallel laminated unit is deposited under upper plane bed regime, the basal unit has to be emplaced under more intense transport conditions.  The central hypotheses of the proposed research are that i) those intense transport conditions correspond to sheet flow, which is a mode of bedload transport characterized by a bedload layer 10-100s grain diameters thick, ii) the sheet flow layer can suppress the formation of parallel laminations, and iii) this suppression results in a tendency to homogenize the grain fabric of the emplaced deposit under conditions of continued deposition.  It must be acknowledged that sheet flow is not the only mechanism that produces massive deposits, but the conditions for it to operate can be commonly met at field scale.\r\nBased on the results of preliminary laboratory experiments, an experimental and numerical program is proposed to characterize the deposition of massive versus parallel laminated deposits.  Open channel, i.e. river-like, laboratory experiments will be performed to build a deposit under upper regime plane bed and sheet flow transport conditions.  The choice of this experimental setting is dictated by the need to induce sediment deposition in the sheet flow regime at laboratory scale.  However, the experiments will be specifically designed to model intense and net-depositional subaqueous flows.  The numerical program is centered on the development of a model that is able to reproduce the grain fabric of the deposits emplaced under upper plane bed and sheet flow transport conditions.  The model will be validated against the experimental results.  The results of the laboratory and numerical work will provide the necessary information to i) characterize the mechanics of upper plane bed and sheet flow transport regimes in general, and ii) relate the grain fabric of the deposit to the characteristics of the flow and the sediment transport.  They are thus expected to have a transformative impact on the communities studying subaqueous sedimentary processes, coastal and deep-water engineering. \r\nOne graduate student will take the lead in the performance of the experimental and numerical work to pursue his PhD research.  He will also be responsible for the organization of the laboratory and numerical data and for their timely dissemination through the CDSMS and the NCED repositories.  Four undergraduate students will be hired in three years to prepare them for graduate studies via undergraduate research projects that will be directly supervised by the PI.",

These deposits are generally characterized by a lower erosional surface followed in ascending order by a sandy deposit and a muddy deposit.  In general, the sandy deposit can be divided in three parts, 1) a basal unit in which the sand grains do not seem to be organized in any particular pattern (massive unit), 2) an intermediate unit in which the sand grains are organized in long, continuous and nearly horizontal thin layers (parallel laminated), and 3) a top layer in which the sand grains are organized in strongly inclined laminae.  One example of a massive and a parallel laminated unit is presented in Figure 1. \n\n \n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that the two laminated units are formed in presence of sediment waves somewhat similar to those that can be observed on the bottom of a river or on a sandy beach.  The mechanisms for the formation of the massive units are less clear.  They are thought to form when a very strong current transports the sand in suspension and then deposits it very rapidly.  This research project was built on the hypothesis that suspended sediment transport and rapid deposition were not necessary for the formation of a massive unit.  In other words, the hypothesis of this project was that a strong current was able to move sand in a near bed layer (sheet flow layer) when sediment waves were absent and sediment deposition from this near bed layer resulted in the formation of the sandy massive units.\n\n \n\nTo test this hypothesis we performed laboratory experiments in the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of South Carolina that resulted in the formation of parallel laminated and massive deposits.  In particular, the experiments showed that 1) the massive units were deposited by stronger currents than the parallel laminated units, and 2) in the experiments with the deposition of massive units sediment waves did not form and the sand was transported in a sheet flow layer.
