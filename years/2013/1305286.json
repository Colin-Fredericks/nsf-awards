 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure proposal supports the acquisition of a personal robot and a high-end multi-\r\nGPU workstation to develop a new robot testbed for designing and evaluating the next generation of parallel\r\nrobot algorithms and open-source software systems on modern commodity computing platforms. The robot\r\nplatform will be based on a Meka M1 robot, a state-of-the-art robot with compliant, dextrous arms plus\r\ncamera and range sensors. This robot will be used to develop a new set of motion strategy and planning\r\nalgorithms and evaluate the capabilities of the robots for two driving applications: (1) assisting older adults\r\nand people with disabilities with activities of daily living and (2) active tele-presence to give people in a\r\nremote environment the ability to physically interact with people in the robot?s environment.\r\n\r\nThis robot testbed could lead to novel technologies for the development of personal\r\nrobots for assistance with tasks of daily living and active telepresence. These new capabilities could significantly\r\nimprove the quality of life for the elderly, people with disabilities, and other individuals. The development\r\nof real-time motion strategies could also benefit other areas, such as surgical simulation, CAD/CAM,\r\nvirtual prototyping, and virtual reality environments. The software libraries developed under this project\r\nwould be made widely available through the public-domain release for all research and educational activities\r\nacross science, engineering, and medical domains. Teh research team will also integrate research with education, reach out\r\nto under-represented groups via programs such as the IBM-sponsored Girls? summer camps, actively involving\r\nundergraduates in the proposed research, and organizing workshops on many-core computing for real-time\r\nmotion strategies. Finally, the team expects the new robotics curriculum enabled by the proposed equipment acquisition\r\nto help increase enrollment in Computer Science.",
