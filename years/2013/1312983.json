 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this work is to detect and characterize very low mass white dwarfs in binary systems, in order to help understand likely Type Ia supernovae progenitors. About 30-50 new systems will be identified and studied with a new census of extremely low-mass white dwarfs identified using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hyper-Velocity Star Survey. This work will provide critical new insights into the formation and fate of exotic low-mass white dwarfs. It will also give us new tests of General Relativity and tidal evolution in short-period systems.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the constituents and history of the cosmos lies at the heart of modern astrophysics. In the last 15 years, observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) indicate that the expansion of the universe is dominated by dark energy. Until we find the progenitors, it is impossible to understand the systematic uncertainties and to optimize SNe Ia to definitively explore cosmology. The SNe Ia progenitor problem is therefore a key problem in astronomy today, and this research promises to add significant knowledge to our understanding of these exotic systems. The work also has a broad plan for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral involvement in the observations, data analysis, and dissemination of results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nWhite dwarf stars are roughly the size of the Earth and half the mass of the Sun.  Their compact nature gives astrophysicists an opportunity to examine extreme states of matter.  They hold clues to mysteries as close as the future of the Sun to as distant as the age and evolution of the Galaxy; they allow exploration of the exotic physics of dark matter and the crystallization of dense Coulomb plasmas, as well as basic physics relevant to theories of turbulent convection and stellar convection/pulsation interaction.\n\nWe observed targets identified spectroscopically as extremely low-mass (ELM; mass less than 0.3 times the Sun's mass) white dwarfs to search for potential pulsations, eclipses, and ellipsoidal variations.  We have discovered the first three pulsating ELM white dwarfs (ELMVs) with confirmed radial velocity variations, all on the 2.1-m Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We established that the known ELMVs lie in the extension of the normal mass (DAV) instability strip, the region of temperature and stellar mass where pulsating white dwarfs of normal mass are found.  This suggests that the driving in the ELMVs is the same as that of the normal mass white dwarfs: hydrogen partial ionization.  Within this extended instability strip, we found six additional pulsating stars with ELM-like spectra.  Of these new pulsators, five do not have detectable RV variations&mdash;one of which exhibits exceptionally long-period pulsations.\n\nWith funding from this grant, we have also discovered a new class of white dwarf star that exhibits a previously unknown phenomenon: outbursts. These outbursts last from several to many hours&mdash;two to three orders of magnitude longer than their dynamical timescales&mdash;and have amplitudes of 10 &minus; 30%; the recurrence timescales are days to weeks. Our group was responsible for finding the first six such \"outbursters,\" establishing this unknown and unexpected class of object. Previously, the only other white dwarfs known to outburst did so because of mass transfer from a companion star, while these new \"outbursters\" are believed to be isolated, non-interacting stars. \n\nIn addition, we have made a third major discovery.  Recently, we demonstrated that pulsating white dwarfs observed with the Kepler spacecraft show two distinct kinds of modes: those with phases and amplitudes coherent over several months and those lacking this coherence.  This phenomenon appears to be intimately tied to convection in these objects, and we are readying this work for publication.\nFinally, for the past 9 years we have run an Astronomy \"stream\" for the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) program at UT-Austin.  This program involves freshmen and sophomores directly in our science, including the reduction, analysis, and interpretation of the data.  All learn about our work at McDonald Observatory and many travel there to obtain data for their own projects. This allows them to experience the thrill of new discovery&mdash;to know something about the Universe no one has ever known before.  To date, this class has led to multiple publications, many peer-reviewed, with undergraduates as co-authors.  Our students have won numerous awards and go on to graduate study in physics and astronomy programs at a high rate.  We also participate in the \"Shadow a Scientist\" program at UT, which brings in middle school students during the Summer; they receive a tour of our lab and other facilities, hear about our science, and get a feeling for what it means to \"do science\".\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael H Montgomery"
