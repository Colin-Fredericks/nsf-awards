 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR project's innovation is a unique web-based authoring framework for creating animated interactive web content that replaces university-level STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) textbooks in traditional or online courses. The confluence of HTML5, cloud services, and ubiquitous portable devices enables widespread use of web-native content having engaging effective activities for students including animations, interactive simulators including mini-games, and self-assessments. Such content is difficult to develop/maintain in traditional publishing paradigms involving a small author/editor core team. A wiki-style crowdsourced approach, with oversight by an author/editor core team, is more scalable but web-based authoring tools support only limited content types like text or drawings. The project's intellectual merit lies in developing a novel web-based authoring tool for creating HTML5 code for animations, including a novel automated synthesis of the code from abstract restricted-form English-sentence specifications inspired by experiences in developing state-of-the-art automated circuit synthesis techniques. The merit also lies in a new repository of parameterized interactive simulations with potentially wide applicability in STEM fields. Results will include the initial tool and repository, plus use by instructors and graduate students from several universities to demonstrate crowdsourcing feasibility.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project includes catalyzing a new partnering approach between a publisher and universities, striking a new balance between core-team authored content and crowdsourcing. A core author/editor team creates initial content and outlines needs, requiring less upfront investment, and the community adopts the content and contributes items under the core team's curation. Curated crowdsourced content can dramatically improve content and reduce creation/maintenance costs. The approach can expand to curated crowdsourced homeworks, automated grading, online help tools, quizzing services, student performance analysis, and more, unleashing synergy among universities to build common tools that benefit the community, a necessity made manifest due to drastic reductions in university budgets. The project's initial focus on computer science lower-division topics may yield company revenues of $5M in textbooks within a few years and $10M considering expanded services shifted from university to company, for CS alone, and $40M-$50M for multiple STEM disciplines. The addressable market for lower division STEM is $1B textbooks and $2B expanded services. The project's approach provides a practical strategy, with individual instructors initially adopting the content as a textbook replacement for campus-based or online classes, followed by possible expanded service arrangements made with departments/universities.",

The tool forms an excellent foundation for continued experimentation and content development. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Zyante conducted several user studies which demonstrate that students show significant improvements in learning outcomes when using zyBooks as opposed to using traditional textbooks. In one such study, 128 students from UC Riverside's CS10 Introduction to Programming class were invited to participate in a randomized, controlled study. Each student was randomly assigned to either a section from Zyante's material on Programming in C++ on a specific topic that was yet to be studied in class, or to sections from a leading textbook on C++ on the same topic. Each student was given a pre&shy;test, and then he/she spent approximately 15&shy; to 30 minutes learning the topic. The student was then given a post&shy;test and a short survey in which to rank their engagement. The results were striking. While on average, the improvement score (score on post&shy;test minus the score on pre&shy;test) was 16% higher for zyBook users, students in the lowest quartile had a 64% higher improvement score.\n\nResults from these user studies showing the positive impact of animated, interactiv..."
