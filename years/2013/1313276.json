It will use the VISTA Magellanic Clouds (VMC) near IR survey photometry to extend a catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) to solar masses. The program will measure the amount of molecular gas present as a test of recent star formation theories and will ascertain the effects on the structure and formation of dense pre-stellar cores.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc in the use of ALMA, and release of GPIPS survey results and software to the astronomical community. The Baltimore-based postdoc and graduate students of Dr. Meixner will participate in Project ASTRO, which reaches out to the Baltimore City School system, while Co-I Dr. Indebetouw and his students will create new multi-wavelength components for K-12 teacher workshops.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStars form from the densest regions of gas in a galaxy. Fundamental\nquestions in astronomy include: how dense does the gas have to be to\ncollapse and form stars?  Are the physical conditions in dense regions\nof galaxies all the same or do they differ from galaxy to galaxy, and\nregion to region?  This project studied several aspects of those\nquestions, and in particular, whether the physics of star formation is\ndifferent in a galaxy that has a lower concentration of heavy elements\nthan our Milky Way.  Galaxies in the early universe, for example, had\nsuch lower concentrations, because there had not been as much time\nsince the Big Bang for stars to create the heavy elements.\n\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array is an incredibly powerful new\ntelescope that has given us the ability to study for the first time\nthe detailed structure of dense gas in galaxies outside of the Milky\nWay.  In particular, gas clumps smaller than a few light years in\nsize, which will form one or a few stars if they collapse, were nearly\nimpossible to study before ALMA.  The Magellanic Clouds are two small\nneighbor galaxies to the Milky Way, both of which fortuitously have\nreduced concentrations of heavy elements similar to galaxies in the\nearly We have studied more than a dozen regions in the Magellanic\nClouds with ALMA, and determined the sizes, masses, shapes, and\ninternal motions of small clumps of dense gas in those regions.\n\nWe find that the basic process by which gravity pulls a cloud of gas\ntogether, causing it collapse and form stars, is not dramatically\ndifferent in an environment that has a low concentration of heavy\nelements.  This was not a foregone conclusion, because for example,\nthose heavy elements can dominate the rate at which a cloud can cool\ndown, and by lowering its temperature and pressure, allow it to\ncollapse.  We found that different regions have different properties,\napparently mostly due to large-scale influences in their galaxy, for\nexample one of the Magellanic Clouds is colliding with the far outer\nreaches of our own Milky Way, and that disturbance has changed the\namount of dense gas on that side of the galaxy.  We also found that\nthe observations that astronomers can make are affected by the\nconcentration of heavy metals - in particular, one of the most\ncommonly used tools is measurement of emission from carbon monoxide\n(CO), and if there is less carbon and oxygen, there is less CO, and it\nis more difficult to observe with a telescope.\n\nFigure 1 shows a region N11B, with warm dust in red imaged by the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, hot gas in green traced by emission from\nionized hydrogen, and emission from CO in dense gas in white contours,\nobserved with ALMA.  The concentration of young stars about the same\nmass as our sun, extracted from Hubble Space Telescope images, is\nshown in blue, and individual young stars much more massive than our\nSun are marked with red circles. In this region, dense clumps of gas\nobserved with ALMA contain massive stars in the process of forming,\nbut there is a large concentration of solar-mass stars to the south of\nexisting dense clumps, indicating that there was once gas there as\nwell, which has all collapsed to make those stars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Remy Indebetouw"
