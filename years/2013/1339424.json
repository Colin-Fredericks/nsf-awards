 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Level Playing Field Institute will design and implement a comprehensive Advanced Placement computer science preparatory course sequence within its 3-year Summer Math and Science Honors Academy (SMASH) to prepare underrepresented high school students of color to pursue computer science degrees in higher education. The project will to provide 345 African American and Latino low-income, first-generation high school students from schools in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles Area the opportunity to engage early (9th grade) and consistently (three 5-week courses over 3 summers) with computer science curriculum. This course sequence will adopt the Exploring Computer Science curriculum and introduce students to the field of computer science, while making computer science relevant to the cultural background and lived experiences of students of color. This project aims to: (1) integrate computer science into the core program components of the SMASH Academy, providing a 3-year AP CS Principles preparatory sequence for all students; (2) examine the impact of a 3-year computer science sequence on the learning outcomes, aspirations, beliefs, attitudes, and longitudinal outcomes of underrepresented high school students; and (3) examine the impact of online AP CS Principles courses on student outcomes and examine implications for online computer science courses to address disparities facing underrepresented students and broaden participation in computer science.",

Students received approximately 112.5 hours of computing instruction over 3 summers, and took an optional 6 month Saturday course during their senior year to prepare for the AP CS A exam. In addition to the curriculum, the program included guest speakers, mentorship events, and visits to tech companies to further expose students to career opportunities within computer science. A 6-day CS professional development course was developed and implemented for CS instructors.

The percentage of students who completed the SMASH program and went on to major in a computing-related major nearly quadrupled over the course of the intervention, from 9% in 2014 to 35% in 2016, with 39 currently pursuing computing majors in college. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project also resulted in broader impacts beyond numbers of students served and increased computing preparation and career trajectories.
