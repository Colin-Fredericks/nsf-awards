 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri-Columbia is examining an innovative model of situated Professional Development (PD) and the contribution of controlled teaching experiences to teacher learning and, as a result, to student learning.  The project is carrying out intensive research about an existing special PD summer institute (QuEST) that has been in existence for more than five years through a state Improving Teacher Quality Grants program.  The project will do the following: (1) undertake more in-depth and targeted research to better understand the efficacy of the PD model and impacts on student learning; (2) develop and field test resources from the project that can produce broader impacts; and (3) explore potential scale-up of the model for diverse audiences.  The overarching goals of the project are: (a) Implement a high-quality situated PD model for K-6 teachers in science; (b) Conduct a comprehensive and rigorous program of research to study the impacts of this model on teacher and student learning; and (c) Disseminate project outcomes to a variety of stakeholders to produce broader impacts.  A comparison of two groups of teachers will be done.  Both groups will experience a content (physics) and pedagogy learning experience during one week in the summer.  During a second week, one group will experience \"controlled teaching\" of elementary students, while the other group will not.  Teacher and student gains will be measured using a quantitative and qualitative, mixed-methods design.",

This is not dissimilar to theoretical perspectives, in which teachers' specialized knowledge for teaching, or pedagogical content knowledge (PCK; Shulman, 1986), is viewed as arising from classroom teaching experience. Field experiences and practice teaching have long been recognized as essential to the learning of prospective teachers, yet rarely have professional development (PD) experiences for teachers been based around actual teaching experiences. Thus, a common complaint about traditional PD workshops is that they are too far removed from the day-to-day work of the classroom to have meaningful impact (Putnam &amp; Borko, 2000). The <em>Quality Elementary Science Teaching </em>(QuEST) professional development program used an innovative model that allows teachers to gain experience teaching new content and strategies through an embedded practicum experience with children. With funding from the National Science Foundation, our team set out to (1) undertake more in-depth and targeted research to better understand the efficacy of this practicum-based professional development model and impacts on student learning; (2) develop and field test resources from the project that can produce broader impacts; and (3) explore potential scale-up of the model for diverse audiences.

However, we found no significant difference on quantitative assessments between teachers who participated in our practicum-based experience and those who completed a comparison experience.

Finally, it alerted us to an overlooked problem in elementary science education. Over the course of the project we were able to document the widespread practice of grade level reassignment of teachers among participating districts and provide evidence of the impact not only on our ability to study the impacts of our professional development programs, but also on teachers' professional development needs. Our research documented how newly reassigned teachers were, in many ways, more akin to their novice colleagues than similarly experienced peers; however, they followed different learning trajectories in the PD. With over 60% of participants being reassigned to new grade levels in the three years following the PD program, the challenge for professional development to help teachers learn new content and curriculum resumes.

The outcomes of our study demonstrate how practicum-based professional development can play an important role in this.
