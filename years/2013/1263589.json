 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the effects of urban redevelopment on residents and other users of the urban built environment.  The research will analyze urban government and planning projects that seek to enhance public life, stimulate consumption, recreation and urban tourism, and establish norms of civil behavior.  Specifically, research will focus on the actual effects and outcomes of such projects and whether those effects and outcomes match the objectives of government and urban planning.  The project will be carried out in three interior Chinese cities undergoing large-scale projects redeveloping both the commercial and residential built environment.  Preliminary field reconnaissance suggests that such redevelopments are viewed by municipal officials as ways of modernizing older socialist architecture and city plans by introducing new market-oriented economic forms of development.  But officials also tend to view urban redevelopment projects as capable of improving resident behavior and creating 'civilized' cities with 'harmonious' development.  Critical scholars have suggested that such projects, while often improving standards of living and increasing consumption for many urban residents, should also be understood as enhancing state disciplinary power over citizens.  This research will test empirically whether the actual effects and outcomes match the objectives of urban planners and, in doing so, will address two significant questions:  1) do these projects indeed change resident behavior in significant ways? and 2) do these projects in fact enhance state power in the case of China specifically?  By answering these questions, this research will provide a grounded empirical study that interrogates popular assumptions about the nature of authoritarian state power and whether urban planning and urban built environments are effective conveyors of that power.\r\n\r\nResearch will be collaborative between the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) and Guizhou Minzu University (GMU).  Fieldwork will directly involve the training of young scholars from both the United States and China in a collaborative manner.  The research will help scholars from a relatively poor and isolated region of China develop networks and ties to a broader international, especially US, academic community than they would otherwise not have.  By publishing in both popular media as well as academic and broader urban planning outlets, results will have the potential to influence both the academic and policy communities.  The project will include workshops, mini-symposia, and conferences at both CU and GMU addressing both the academic and policy implications of research findings.  Results will be featured at the annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers and the Association for Asian Studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sought to understand the relationship between urban redevelopment in China and state efforts to produce 'governable spaces.'  In addition, the project focused on urban redevelopment efforts in cities with significant ethnic minority populations, in order to explore the role of urban space in the governing of China\u00c6s ethnic minorities.  Several small cities in China\u00c6s southwestern interior were chosen as case-study sites.  In testing whether new urban spaces are productive of behaviors and attitudes equated with a 'civilized' and 'harmonious' citizenship among minority, as well as Han Chinese, residents research examined the actual implementations of urban redevelopment projects and their actual effects in terms of how people understood and used new urban spaces, and whether these effects differed in terms of ethnicity.  Research, in particular, focused on new urban leisure spaces, such as parks, public plazas, and refurbished heritage streets and zones.  Fieldwork in three case-study locations during summer months over a three-year period consisted of interviews with city planners and municipal government officials, interviews and focus groups with residents, a surveys of users of public spaces, and participant-observation in public spaces.  Interviews were recorded and transcribed and analyzed.\n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, research found that Chinese urban governing practices require a significant rethinking of the concept of \u00e6authoritarian governmentality\u00c6.  Research confirmed the expected hypothesis that the effectiveness of indirect governing strategies &ndash; the kind of \u00e6governing from afar\u00c6 that governmentality studies tend to emphasize &ndash; is typically overstated.  In particular, that effectiveness is overstated by urban officials and planners who view the management of urban spaces as a tool for the management of urban populations.  Research found that spatial \u00e6tactics and strategies\u00c6 of governmentality which focused on creating governable \u00e6ethnic spaces\u00c6 were largely ineffective in determining the behavior of urban residents in the ways that planners and officials envisioned.  That is, ethnicity was found to have no significant bearing on urban spatial governmentality.  Spatial changes did, however, impact attitudes and behaviors.  Just not in the ways planners expected.  Thus, \u00e6authoritarian governmentality\u00c6 was no more totalizing than liberal governmentality, and that state power in China is not built from the \u00e6bottom up.\u00c6  Does this mean, however, that Chinese governmentality is basically the same as that found in liberal states?  No.  Research found governmentality to be less effective in China for different reasons than those identified in the critical scholarship on liberal governmentality.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, this was a collaborative project with local scholars, seeking to integrate research and education for the benefit of society at large.  Fieldwork involved the training of eight graduate research assistants, and several undergraduate students who assisted with survey implementation, transcription, and logistics.  A one-day conference was held in China to discuss and help disseminate the research results, and results were also discussed as part of a recent symposium at the University of Colorado Center for Asian Studies.\n\nIn addition to publications (listed below), outcomes of this research include an extended collaborative research project with colleagues at the Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, with joint proposals currently under consideration by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council and the Luce Foundation.  This new project represents the next step of taking the current project\u00c6s findings and extending and comparing them to other regions of China, as well as internationally.  Research results were presented at the Annual Meetings of the Association for Asian Studies (2016, 2015), at the Annual Meetings of the Association of Ame..."
