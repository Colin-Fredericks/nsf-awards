The extremely small Tustea fossil site is presently 90% destroyed by unwarranted bulldozing. The destruction of the relatively thin fossil-bearing layer represents a major loss for paleontology and science and threatens hope for future, long-term studies of the identity of the embryos, their phylogenetic placement, in depth paleobiological investigations of the nesting sites, and the association of dinosaur embryos with the associated eggs. Dr. Codrea from the University of Cluj discovered and recovered fossil dinosaur eggs and embryos. He asked Dr. Grellet-Tinner to travel to Cluj to assist in the salvaging operation and study of the resultant specimens. The PI's home institution, the Journey Museum in Rapid city, South Dakota, serves a large community of Native Americans, the regional school system, and the national and international adult population. A portion of the museum's geology/paleontology exhibit features the PI's previous research. It will be updated and expanded to incorporate the outcome of the new research in the form of displays and molds of the embryos and eggs.",

The site is located in the Hateg Basin, part of the Mesozoic Hateg Island, nested in the Carpathian Mts (Fig. 1).\n\nWhat was accomplished?  Activities, objectives, and results\n\nSalvaging fossil dinosaur eggs and embryos\n\nHistorically, the continental deposits of the Hateg basin of Transylvania were brought to the attention of the scientific community a century ago through the work of Baron Nopcsa. Then, in the 1990\u00c6s, Dr. Grigorescu reported the findings of dinosaur embryos in ovo from this site. Although, the in ovo association was never substantiated, the presence of dinosaur eggs and embryos represents a unique fossil assemblage, as to date, only two other comparable instances have been documented in the world.  News of the destruction of this site by unwarranted bulldozing triggered the present RAPID request.\n\nAs per field observations, the site is entirely destroyed and all the evidences point to a malicious action from Dr. Grigorescu, as according to the bulldozer driver, he was present, supervising, and monitoring the destruction of the Tustea dinosaur nesting site (Fig. 2).  The causes of this action are still unclear and beyond the scope of this research.\n\nOne of the 3 proposed objectives of this RAPID grant was to perform preliminary observations of the fossils eggs and embryos.\n\nThe destruction of the relatively thin fossil-bearing layer represents major loss for paleontology, as it likely eliminates any hope for future long-term studies.  However, the PI with his two Romanian colleagues was able to recover a substantial amount of dinosaur embryonic bones, a complete egg, and several eggshell fragments (Fig. 3). The eggshell fragments from the complete egg were compared with the scattered specimens in a preliminary study at the university of Sydney microscopic center using scanning electron microscopy, micro-CT characterizations (Fig. 4), and electron backscatter diffraction analyses (Fig. 5).  In addition to the above-mentioned oological microcharacterizations, one of the embryonic bones was thin sectioned to estimate its ontogenetic maturity.  Presently, results show that:\n\nThe egg material is homogenous and represents a single taxon;\nThe skeletal material belongs to a basal dwarf hadrosaurid, Telmatosaurus transylvanicus;\nThe bone structure indicates that the embryos were extremely mature, nearly at the hatching stage (Fig. 6).\nThe oological material and the embryos are taxonomically discordant.  The skeletal remains indicate a hadrosaurid identity while the oological specimens would suggest a titanosaurid affinity. A follow up study is needed to confirm these preliminary results.\n\n\nAlthough the results of my preliminary observations are excellent, I will need more funds in the near future to complete this study.
