 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding species responses to climate change is one of the central problems in ecology. Over the last decade, the researchers who will lead this project have used the elevation gradient spanning 3500 m from the Amazonian lowlands to the Andean treeline as a natural laboratory for investigating forest and ecosystem ecology. That previous work has documented tree migration in response to climate change, and predicted changes in the ranges of species under different scenarios of change. This project will now go further to investigate the underlying causes of such changes in where trees grow.  The researchers will compare the physiology of plant species known to be migrating in response to climate change in the Andes and Amazon with the physiology of species that are holding their ground, and test the importance of environmental factors such as temperature, soil, herbivory and fungal pathogens.  The results will help understand where tree species can survive, what affects their growth, and what limits their range along environmental gradients.  The project will increase our ability to predict and model the effects of climate change on natural systems, particularly tropical montane forests, which are areas of high biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a suite of educational activities, resources, and opportunities aimed at teaching K-12 and college students about tropical ecology and the effects of global climate change; training opportunities for international and minority students which will assist them in pursuing advanced education and careers in the natural sciences; and the dissemination of results to a broad scientific and lay audience, including Spanish translations and versions of resources.",

Working along a steep gradient of elevation, temperature and precipitation in tropical Andes -- the area with the highest concentration of species on Earth -- we tested the causal underpinning of two basic and salient patterns of biodiversity as related to climate.&nbsp; The first pattern is that most tree species have very narrow ranges, or realized niches, with respect to the environment.&nbsp; The second pattern is that these ranges are changing through time. From fossil records we know that species moved in the past to remain in their favored temperature and moisture zones.

In particular, we showed that species perform best in their home environments, and do much poorer when transplanted downslope into warmer temperatures, but perform nearly the same or only slightly poorer when transplanted upslope into cooler temperatures.  These results were more pronounced for species from the lowlands and the highest elevations, while species from the middle elevation cloud forests had a greater capacity for acclimating to warming.\n\n \n\nOur results show that while there are generalities in species? responses to environmental change, there is a large amount of heterogeneity.  This variation between species reflects the differences found in the patterns of responses of adult trees.  Our results also show that there are factors beyond temperature, such as the moderating effects of clouds, that will be important in determining some species? responses to warming &ndash; again reflecting patterns seen in the distribution of adult trees.  One striking result was the importance of species interactions in setting range limits.  The physiological responses of species to climate, and the effect of natural enemies on them, is what will allow ecology to advance from phenomenological descriptions to mechanistically based predictions of species responses to climate change.  What we have also demonstrated is the feasibility of using multi-factorial reciprocal transplant experiments in a highly challenging environment in order to answer basic questions about species? ranges and species? responses to climate change.\n\n \n\nBeyond basic science, a core objective of the study was to create a suite of educational activities, resources, and opportunities aimed at teaching K-12 and college students about tropical ecology and the effects of global climate change, as well as training opportunities for international and minority students that will assist them in pursuing advanced education and/or careers in natural sciences.  Towards these aims, we taught a set of field-based courses which introduced US and Peruvian students to a variety of natural ecosystems as well as the threats facing these ecosystems.  We also helped design and teach a series of workshops and hands-on learning activities for US middle and high school students to teach them the concepts of ecology, conservation, and global change biology. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miles R Silman"
