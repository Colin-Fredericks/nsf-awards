 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the millimeter/sub-millimeter optical properties of cosmic analog dusts at low temperatures. A dry cryocooler will be purchased so that work on this project can continue, free from the expenses of perishable cryogens. In addition, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer, designed specifically for this work, will be constructed in PI's research lab. Once these apparati are in place, the mm/sub-mm opacity and emissivity of many dust samples, made internally or obtained from external groups will be measured, using an innovative program of study. The main goals of this work are to (A) utilize the rich set of tools and expertise developed within the observational cosmology community to measure the above properties to unprecedented accuracy, (B) analyze dust species produced by different methods and different investigators under the same experimental conditions in order to clearly understand common trends and basic difference between the samples, and (C) implement an efficient experimental scheme for analyzing a large number of dust candidates, which would naturally lead to the creation of a database on the measured properties.\r\n\r\nAt visible wavelengths, dust obscures many interesting astronomical environments such as molecular clouds, star forming regions, young and old stars enveloped by dust, and young ultra-luminous galaxies in the early universe. The mm/sub-mm spectral region is a good regime to study these objects because dust is more transparent at these wavelengths. Information on the nature of interstellar dust is useful in and of itself because dust is an important component in galactic and stellar evolution as well as in the complex chemistry present in space that ultimately gives rise to prebiotic molecules, and this information can reveal more about the nature the objects/environments that are obscured by dust. Recent laboratory studies have shown that the properties of dust in the mm/sub-mm spectral region is more complicated than previously thought. Therefore, detailed studies dust species that can serve as analogs for cosmic dust such as those that will be undertaken in this project are needed before astronomical data on such environments can be interpreted with any confidence. This need has been intensified recently due to the availability high-quality mm/sub-mm data from new observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCosmic dust obscures our view of some of the most interesting astronomical objects such as newly forming planetary systems and ancient galaxies experiencing high rates of star formation and star death.  In addition to blocking light, the dust plays an important role in these environments; dust may even be essential for the production of molecules that are needed for the formation of life.  But no one knows for sure the exact composition and properties of cosmic dust.  But we have some good hunches.  Millimeter waves, which are an invisible form of light (just like microwaves), are best for probing cosmic dust.\n\nWe have built a one-of-a-kind instrument to study the absorption and emission of millimeter wave light by various types of dust.  We have also produced, in the chemistry lab, some dust types that are likely to be present in space.  We will be studying those dusts with our new instrument.  Laboratory data on known dust samples, when combined with astronomical data on cosmic dust, can provide clues as to the nature, composition, amount, and properties of cosmic dust in various astronomical environments.  While several European groups have conducted studies of realistic \"cosmic analog\" dusts in space-like conditions, this will be one of the first such studies by an American team.  In addition, this is the first instrument of its kind built specifically for the study of dust and, therefore, is less prone to many of the errors present in previous investigations.  We have successfully completed the construction and testing of the custom instrument and are about to embark on a study of viable cosmic dust candidates.\n\nAnother important aspect of this project, which is taking place at a four-year residential liberal arts college, is the involvement of undergraduate students in research.  During the five-year period of this project, over fifteen students have taken part in it.  Many of them have graduated and gone into graduate study in physics/astronomy, or STEM related careers.  In all of these cases, working on this project was the first substantive research experience gained by the student and, as such, it gave him/her exposure and insights into the world of science and research.  Conducting research at an undergraduate-only institution allows students to gain valuable hands-on research experience and build confidence in their own abilities, which in many cases, strongly influences their future choices and career paths.  In addition to the particular technical skills that they gained by working on this project, all of the student researchers showed development in terms of general research habits and time management, working in a team or with external collaborators, as well as discussing and presenting one's work.  Therefore our project has and will continue to be a fertile ground for producing engaged young scientists and STEM professionals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thushara Perera"
