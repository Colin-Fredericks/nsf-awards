QIP has the potential to revolutionize information processing technologies by enabling ultra-fast computation, efficient simulation of quantum physics, and unbreakable secure communication. Thus the field is not only of fundamental importance intellectually, but also for a prosperous society as well as for national security.\r\n\r\nThe QIP Workshop is the premier annual conference in the theoretical aspects of the field. It brings together hundreds of participants, from leading researchers to aspiring students, of diverse nationality and disciplinary backgrounds. This conference has played a formative role in the field and has become one of the most important venues for the groundbreaking research in the theory of quantum information processing.\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial financial support for US-based students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 16th  Workshop on Quantum Information Processing (QIP 2013), to be held in Beijing, China, on January 21--25, 2013, at Tsinghua University. Availability of travel support will be widely advertised and the recipients will be selected through an open and objective process, based on both merit and need.  This support will permit broader participation by US-based students and postdocs, in particular by members of under-represented groups, contributing to their education and career development. It will facilitate the dissemination of research, and enhance the conference as an international institution for research collaboration and education.",
