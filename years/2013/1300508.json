 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will allow Professor Christopher Bradley of Mount St. Mary's University to investigate the ability of cyclopentadienyl (Cp) cobalt(I) sources to mediate stoichiometric and catalytic carbon-hydrogen bond activation. A combination of computational and synthetic studies will permit structure/reactivity trends to be established for C-H activation in both monomeric and aggregate [Cp-Co] fragments. Specifically, catalytic alkane dehydrogenation will be targeted. The proposed research involves continued mentoring of both high school and undergraduate students in a research environment. In particular, economically disadvantaged high school students in the Maryland and Washington D.C. metro area will have the opportunity to conduct summer research in synthetic chemistry. The students will be encouraged to continue their college education at Mount St. Mary's, through the Third Century Scholar Program.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of aliphatic hydrocarbons to unsaturated products has great value to a range of fields, including commodity chemical and polymer synthesis. Performing this transformation using more abundant metals as catalysts under milder conditions would therefore be ideal. The abilities developed by both high school and undergraduate students supported by this award will prepare them well for pursuit of advanced degrees in the chemical sciences.",
