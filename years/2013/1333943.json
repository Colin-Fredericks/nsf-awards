 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distribution of electricity in the United States relies on overhead lines supported by wood poles. This distribution system suffers damage in high wind events resulting in interruption in electrical power to businesses and residencies. The wood poles suffer from the combined effect of aging and increasing stress from wind hazards leading to an unreliable and potentially unsafe distribution infrastructure. Over 100 million distribution poles, which are part of the critical energy delivery infrastructure, suffer immensely during wind storms. Current methods for predicting the distribution of times-to-failure of a general set of power system components do not address simultaneous effects of aging and hazards with a holistic view. Research on age-at-failure of poles has been sparse, incomplete, and inconsistent. This results in increased uncertainties in predictions of pole lifetimes, thus obstructing informed and accurate decision-making on effective pole management strategies.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes the development of stochastic Finite Element models for distribution poles integrated with time-dependent decay models to simulate the current and future state of the response of distribution poles to various climate conditions. Epistemic uncertainties will be reduced and various sources of aleatoric uncertainties in capacity and demand modeling will be captured. A novel strategy utilizing n-dimensional fragility surfaces integrated with regional hurricane hazard models will be merged to estimate failure probabilities, develop predictive models for the time-to-failure of distribution poles, and quantify the confidence levels in the predictions. A priority-based diagnostics and risk-informed maintenance framework will be developed on the basis of stochastic optimization for distribution networks that takes into account both the geographic exposure of the physical components to stressors and their importance for the reliability of the networks. The success afforded by this approach does not guarantee failure avoidance, but points to the regions in networks where use of well-maintained infrastructure may lower the risk of failures during storms and also provides guidance in selecting the poles for preventive replacement under normal operating circumstances.\r\n",

High wind speeds during hurricanes cause damage to distribution poles and conductors resulting in power outages that last anywhere from days to months, depending on the severity of the storm. Storm related outages cost the US economy $20-$55 billion annually. In the US, overhead distribution lines are mainly supported by wood poles. A significant percentage of existing wood poles are aged and weak. Several decades of decay in the wood poles have made them one of the most important factors causing power outages. Since electrical power systems are Critical Infrastructures (CI), they must be reliable under normal operating conditions and have adequate resiliency towards anticipated contingencies.</p>\n<p>The objective of this project was to develop effective maintenance strategies to improve the reliability and resilience of distribution networks. Toward this goal, the team developed the first generation of multi-dimensional time-dependent fragility functions for wood utility poles. These models express the likelihood of failure as a function of significant factors such as class and height of poles, type, length and number of conductors, and wind intensity, among others. The generated fragility functions constitute a significant step towards identifying the vulnerable segments of distribution networks across large geographic areas. Figure 1 shows the developed age-dependent fragility curves for class three and five poles.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a stochastic framework for prioritizing the inspection of aging wood poles using fragility assessment techniques was developed. For this purpose, a new metric called inspection order index was proposed based on the vulnerability of the poles; large values of the index indicate high risks of failure and, therefore, high priority for inspection. Through integration of the fragility functions and geospatial data of the poles, inspection order index was applied to different counties in Georgia. Subsequently, the counties were color coded for inspection priority. As shown in Figure 2, the darker the color, the higher the priority for inspection.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this study significantly improved the component and system level reliability and resilience analysis of distribution systems in multiple aspects. As distribution lines are long and composed of a large number of spans, modeling the entire system is computationally not feasible. To overcome this challenge, this research developed a set of novel boundary models for static and dynamic analysis of distribution systems. The proposed static boundary model includes a set of equivalent force and spring, while the dynamic boundary model is composed of a few degrees of freedom dynamic system to accurately approximate the effect of boundary spans on the spans of interest. As shown in Figure 3, it was observed that in existing distribution line systems that undergo maintenance and replacement every few years, the impact of boundary models on component level reliability of distribution lines is significant.</p>\n<p>In addition, impacts of previously neglected adjacent spans (boundary effects) and correlation between the failure events of individual poles on system-level reliability of distribution lines were investigated. It turns out that both correlation and boundary effects considerably contribute to performance estimates of distribution systems. Figure 4 indicates that both boundary effects and correlation reduce failure probabilities of the system for all wind intensities. Therefore, neglecting these factors results in an overestimation of the failure probability of the system and may lead to non-optimal risk management solutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another important step in risk informed decision making is to investigate effectiveness of strengthening strategies for enhancing the resilience of distribution networks. For this purpose, a realistic distribution network composed of 3 substations, 7051 poles and protective devices such as switches, breakers and reclosers was generated for a location in the southeast of the US. The configuration of the network is based on actual pole inspection data and information gathered via Google Earth as shown in Figure 5.</p>\n<p>A hurricane resilience assessment model was developed consisting of four sub-models: (1) hurricane hazard model, (2) fragility model, (3) power system response model, and (4) restoration model. This model was applied to the generated distribution network, and the performance curve for estimating the resilience of the power system was obtained as shown in Figure 6. Because of the presence of failed poles close to the substations in many scenarios, there were major outages upon the fall of the hurricane (~95% of the network). It was found that if the extent of damage to utility poles is extensive, network reconfiguration does not cause a notable reduction in outages. A criticality-based ranking of damaged utility poles was proposed to prioritize repair efforts. Repairing the failed poles based on this ranking was found to be the most effective course of action for the network.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">For effective long-term risk management of distribution systems, it is recommended to decide on replacement or strengthening the poles by considering inspection order index and the criticality measure both developed in this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Abdollah&nbsp;Shafieezadeh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333943/1333943_10262651_1510192167211_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333943/1333943_10262651_1510192167211_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333943/1333943_10262651_1510192167211_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
