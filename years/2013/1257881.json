 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many animal species males and females differ in appearance and behavior and these differences usually arise about the time of puberty, when extensive hormone changes occur. However, there is no theoretical reason why differences cannot develop earlier in life as long as the advantages of the differences are expressed later, as adults, in gaining reproductive mates. Nevertheless, this early expression of differences (and the later advantages) has not been the subject of much study. In one excellent case, hatchling male collared lizards that are setting up their territories develop a bright color signal and treat other hatchling males aggressively and hatchling females non-aggressively. These young males begin to pair bond with young females as future mates and repel young males as future mate rivals. This study uses biochemical, genetic, molecular, and field approaches to document the hormones responsible for the development of the early sexual differences in this species, and the genetic advantages expressed later in life. This species is a model for the study of this phenomenon, and results should apply broadly, even to humans. The research should spur more investigation of early male-female differentiation and plant a paradigm shift in evolutionary ecology. \r\n\r\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students will take part in this research and especially Native Americans will be recruited to learn how science is done and communicated. Undergraduates will be individually mentored through all stages of the research, including presentation of results at public conferences. Results will be published in scientific and lay outlets, including magazines, newspapers, television, and the internet. Data will be available at the Oklahoma PetaStore (http://oscer.ou.edu/petastore.php), free to all academic users, and readable results and significance on a webpage accessed from the main public webpage of the Department of Zoology at Oklahoma State University (http://zoology.okstate.edu/).",

They are traits like large body size, prominent horns, or bright colors or adornments of males; traits that help a male attract potential mates or repel other males in fighting or aggressive displays so they don?t gain matings. Cases of sexual selection and differences in morphology and behavior of males and females are widespread and traits are often very exaggerated. The development of these sexual differences appears when males and females reach sexual maturity and they can use the traits to improve mating success. Our study is the first to describe sexual signals developing in pre-reproductive individuals and used to attract females or repel males in juveniles. In collared lizards (<em>Crotaphytus collaris</em>), adult males and females are different from one another in morphology and coloration and males are aggressive against other males, all as a consequence of strong sexual selection. However, pre-reproductive juvenile males (hatchlings in their first several weeks of life prior to their first hibernation) develop bright orange dorsolateral bars and use these bars (HOB, Hatchling Orange Bars, Slide 1) to distinguish males and females and treat other males aggressively while allowing the close presence of females. We conducted a long-term field project of collared lizards to relate the expression of the HOB to hormone concentrations, female preference, aggression, and number of offspring, i.e., fitness, produced the next year when these juveniles matured and mated (Slide 2). We measured the HOB in the laboratory with a reflectance spectrophotometer and converted values to the standard color measurements of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. We found that juvenile females preferred to associate with juvenile males with brighter HOB in choice trials in the laboratory (Slide 3). Areal coverage of HOB was positively related to testosterone levels and juveniles with more areal coverage of HOB were more aggressive to juveniles with less coverage (Slide 4). Finally, juveniles with brighter HOB sired significantly more offspring the next year when they sexually matured, and those with more areal coverage of HOB had a higher probability of siring offspring than males with less areal coverage of HOB (Slide 5). Taken together, the evidence points to a case of pre-reproductive juvenile color traits and behavior used to attract juvenile females (future potential mates) and to repel juvenile males (future reproductive rivals) and augmenting future reproductive success once juveniles sexually mature. We call this precocial sexual selection, a phenomenon not previously described in science.</p>\n<p>We also conducted a long-term field experiment in which we manipulated the aggression of juveniles with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) implants and the coloration of juveniles by recurrent painting to emphasize or obscure the HOB. We measured the spectral reflectance of our painting treatments to ensure the manipulations emphasized or obscured the HOB. We quantified hormone levels and aggression, and collected DNA for documenting subsequent genetic fitness. We found that hormone-implanted subjects were more aggressive than others, and that those who were painted to have brighter or duller HOB, incongruent with their expressed aggression, were retaliated upon by their unmanipulated opponents in neutral arenas in the laboratory (Slide 6). Analyses are in progress to evaluate parentage and subsequent offspring production (fitness differences) related to the treatments.</p>\n<p>Trials with predatory, diurnal snakes did not reveal more susceptibility to snake attacks by (protected) juveniles with and without HOB, nor did attacks by wild predators on clay lizard models with and without HOB placed in the field reveal increased susceptibility to predation by the HOB. Analyses of collected data are in progress to determine if spectral reflectance of juveniles with HOB in their natural environment are more conspicuous than juveniles without HOB to snake and bird predators modeled through their specific visual systems.</p>\n<p>This project has trained more than 90 graduate and undergraduate students in the scientific process, particularly in field biology, behavioral ecology, endocrinology, immunology, and genetics. Graduate students gained mentoring experience as they supervised research assistants. We ensured participation by groups that are currently underrepresented in science, especially Native Americans. We have given multiple posters and presentations to both scientific and lay audiences and results are displayed on campus and in a public website. We have highlighted our research at local elementary schools and participated with workshops numerous times at National Lab Day for high school students. Our work has been highlighted in various public news outlets and we seek to publish results in popular science outlets as well as professional ones. Results from this project have been presented to the lay public in a way that helps to foster a positive attitude and an appreciation for science and the application of science to the general welfare
