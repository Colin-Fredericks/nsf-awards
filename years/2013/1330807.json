 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work involves implementing a multidisciplinary approach using basic biochemistry, spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography techniques to probe some of the key outstanding issues regarding the mechanism of the key enzyme in nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase. We will probe the hypothesis that the redox-dependent structural changes are key to modulating the midpoint potential and defining the role of the P cluster in gated intermolecular electron transfer. The combined use of key site-directed variants and a europium complex redox mediator will facilitate the capture of defined states of the enzyme relevant to the catalytic mechanism that are not possible to observe in the native state, and will answer questions regarding substrate binding to the FeMo-cofactor. Basic research on biological nitrogen fixation could contribute to less energy demanding and more environmentally sound mechanisms to meet the growing demands for fixed nitrogen associated with global population growth, as the availability of fixed nitrogen sources for plant growth is a limiting factor in global nutrition and the production of nitrogenous fertilizers is very energy demanding and can have negative environmental implications. Broader Impacts include student training and significant contributions to training K-12 teachers through the development of an online course on Agriculture and Energy along with other efforts aimed at teachers in remote rural areas that include tribal schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall impact of research on biological nitrogen fixation goes far beyond the potential agronomic and economic impact on global plant productivity.  The production of nitrogenous fertilizers is an energy demanding process requiring hydrogen typically produced from reforming fossil fuels and high-temperature and high-pressure conditions.  In addition, the long-term application of nitrogenous fertilizers has the potential for long-term detrimental environmental and ecological implications.  As the global population continues to increase, the demand for food and energy also increases.  It is clear that the importance of having a fundamental knowledge of the intricacies of biological nitrogen fixation has the potential to offset the demand for fertilizer production.  One of the most fascinating biochemical reactions, nitrogen fixation involves a multiple electron reduction and the activation of the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond.  Nitrogenase has been a difficult enzyme to characterize mechanistically and studies to date that have provided insights into various aspects of the mechanism have provided significant advancements in biochemical, structural, and computation methods.  The complex two-component enzyme nitrogenase is an ideal model system for the study of general processes of metal-mediated catalysis, biological electron transfer, complex metal cluster assembly, protein-protein interactions, nucleotide-dependent conformational change, and signal transduction.  This fascinating ambient condition reaction catalyzed by the nitrogenase biochemical system has profound implications for humanity.  The current method for commercial nitrogen reduction consumes approximately 1-2% of the world's energy portfolio, and is an expensive and dangerous process.  The ultimate aim of this basic research is to lay the foundation for the development of advanced bio-mimetic materials that could catalyze nitrogen fixation under less energy intensive conditions.  Modeling and fabrication of these bio-inspired materials will be incumbent upon a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic fundamentals of this complex multi-component metalloreductase.  The parallels drawn from this system also have profound impacts on medicine and drug development, as many disorders and pathologies are correlated to proteins that undergo ATP dependent conformational changes.\n\nThis challenging project was aimed at capturing and structurally characterizing key intermediates of nitrogenase to provide insights into the catalytic mechanism.
