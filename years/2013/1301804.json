Blaine Lawson\r\n\r\nThese projects are concerned with the study of cycles, nonlinear partial differential equations, and geometric generalizations of pluripotential theory.  The first project concerns fully nonlinear differential equations in riemannian geometry. Recent work of the principal investigator and R. Harvey on the Dirichlet problem will be continued, and questions concerning singularities and tangents to solutions will be investigated.  Motivation for this study came from the investigators' development of pluripotential theory in calibrated and other geometries, where notions of plurisubharmonic functions, pseudo-convex domains, capacity, etc. were introduced and many basic properties established.  This should have an important impact in calibrated geometry, which in turn plays an important role in M-theory in modern physics.  There should also be applications to symplectic geometry and to p-convexity in Riemannian geometry.  The second part of the proposal concerns the groups of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective algebraic variety.  Here the aim is to understand these groups and relate them to the global structure of the variety itself.  The investigator has, with others, established a theory of homology type for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of cycles spaces.  This theory will be applied to concrete questions about algebraic spaces, and implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored.  Striking connections to universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior research will also be probed.  A strongly related part of the proposal concerns cycles which bound holomorphic chains in projective manifolds. Characterizations in terms of projective linking numbers and quasi-plurisubharmonic functions will be studied.  This will involve analyzing the structure of projective hulls, a concept analogous to polynomial hulls, which has been introduced by the investigator and is of independent interest.  Projective hulls are related to approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the spectrum of Banach graded algebras.  The final area concerns analytic approaches to differential characters, and their generalizations, developed by the PI.  The central objects mediate between cycles and smooth data. In the complex category this involves an analytic study of Deligne cohomology.  It yields invariants for bundles and foliations, and retrieves the classical Abel-Jacobi mappings.  Variational methods will be brought to bear on the study and connect it to the 1-Laplacian and the theory of minimal hypersurfaces.  \r\n\r\nA concept of central importance in geometry is that of a \"cycle.\" In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry cycles arise in many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings. Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with a particular geometry (discovered by the investigator and his collaborators) play a fundamental role in modern physical theories This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.  Students will be part of the research team. There will also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSome years back the PI and Reese Harvey discovered and investigated something called calibrated geometries.   Each such geometry is a large collection of ``surfaces'' (like spheres or tori, but  in higher dimensions) with the property that they minimize  volume among all other surfaces homologous to them.  Many rich geometries were found not just in euclidean space but in other important spaces with special geometric structures (for example, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and  G(2) and Spin(7) manifolds).\n\nThese calibrated geometries are generalizations of Kaehler geometry, which is central to many areas of mathematics from analysis to algebraic geometry. In physics these geometries, and the special spaces they live in, have been very important in modern string theory and M-theory.\n\nMore recently the PI and Harvey found that every  space with a calibrated geometry carries an analytic side, that is, a theory of ``plurisubharmonic functions'',  with a  natural differential equation and an entire associated potential theory.  In Kaehler geometry the differential equation is the complex Monge-Ampere equation, and the pluri-potential theory is a large part of the classical analysis.\n\nDealing with the deeper questions in these theories meant understanding degenerate, fully nonlinear partial differential equations arising in a very geometric way.  This led to a large project  concerning such equations on manifolds,  and the potential theories associated to them.\n\nThe investigators have made great progress and have found results that apply far beyond calibrated analysis.  They have, for example, established existence and uniqueness for the Dirichlet Problem for very highly degenerate equations on manifolds.  These methods have allowed one to defined notions of capacity for these equations.  It has also allowed  existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet Problem with arbitrarily prescribed singularities.\n\nA important theory concerning tangents (i.e., limits under dilations) to subsolutions for such equations has been established. Important in this is a new invariant called the {\\sl Riesz charateristic} of the theory.  In a large variety of geometric cases, including almost every case arising  in calibrated geometry, one has proved Strong Uniqueness:  Tangents exist uniquely at every point,\nand are always multiples of the classical Riesz kernel  associated to the Riesz characteristic.\n\nSuch strong uniqueness fails for real, complex and quaternionic Monge-Ampere Equations, but here the tangents have been classified.\n\nThere is also a notion of densities for subsolutions, with structural results.\n\nThe generality of this work has allowed important applications to other fields. For example, the Dirichlet problem has been solved  for the  homogenous and inhomogeneous  Monge-Amp\\`ere equation on {\\bf almost} complex manifolds --  those where the complex structure is not integrable.  In fact,  an entire pluripotential theory has been established in this case.  One outcome is the solution of an old problem concerning downward approximation of plurisubharmonics by  smooth plurisubharmonics functions.\n\nOne area where almost complex structures play a very important role is symplectic geometry, where Gromov has introduced metrics and almost complex structures leading to the Gromov-Witten invariants so important  in mathematics an physics today. The investigators results apply not only to these almost complex spaces but also to the underlying Lagrangian geometry.\n\nThe investigators have found an intrinsic Lagrangian potential theory on any symplectic manifold endowed with a Gromov metric.    This theory has an associated polynomial differential operator, which is a new Lagrangian version of the complex Monge-Ampere operator.  This new equation has many solutions, and is related to complex spinors on the space. It should turn out to be fundamental to many question in this area.\n\nIn general the results of this investigation have applied to many areas of mathematics.  For example in analysis it has been shown that enlarging the classical relationship between nonlinear partial differential equations and pluripotential theory has many important consequences.  Basic results have been found concerning almost complex spaces, symplectic manifolds and calibrated geometries.  It seems clear that the effect will widen since these topics are of central importance at the moment.\n\nGiven the important interest of calibrated geometries in physics, these new results should  prove to be  useful there.\n\nOf course this program has been very involved with training advanced graduate students and young researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: H.
