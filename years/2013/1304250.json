  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is well-known that many familiar geometric objects, including circles, spheres, cones, and parabolas, can be described mathematically in terms of polynomial equations. Furthermore, it also happens to be the case that many of the geometric objects that arise in physics, and also more practical applications of math, such as engineering, design, and even cryptography, can also be described by polynomial equations.  As such, it is important for us to understand the nature of such geometric objects.  In fact, it is especially important for us to understand these objects when they happen to not be smooth, that is, when they contain various sharp corners and bends.\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of this project is to study geometric objects of this form (often called algebraic varieties), and our main tool to do so is the Frobenius morphism, or p-th power map.  The Frobenius map only makes sense in certain discrete settings, so it is perhaps surprising that it can also tell us a lot about the continuous geometric objects we are familar with, and interested in.  As an NSF postdoc, the PI further developed the use of the Frobenius morphism to measure the complexity of algebraic varieties (that is, how far they are from being smooth) in the discrete prime characteristic setting, and strengthened connections between Frobenius and other measures of complexity from algebraic geometry, namely, those arising from resolution of singularities and integration.\n\nApart from the mathematical contributions, the PI also served as a mentor to both undergraduate and graduate students during his time as an NSF postdoc.  Indeed, he co-founded a learning-mentoring seminar for graduate students and postdocs at the University of Utah.  The main purpose of this seminar was to bring these two groups together, and to provide graduate students with mentors who are more senior, yet still not too far removed from being graduate students themselves.  This seminar was largely a success, and the PI is proud to report that it continues to this day!\n\nIn addition to this, the PI was an active member of the AWM, and also continued his career-long mentoring of undergraduate students. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Hernandez"
