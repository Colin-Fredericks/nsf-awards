  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported research in two different areas of mathematical research.  First, the award supported work on understanding how to generate certain matrices at random.  Such analysis underlies how accurately and efficiently computers can test a hypothesis about matrices, which is important because many questions about randomness (whether for gambling or cryptography or other areas of mathematics) can be phrased this way.  Second, the award support work better understanding a family of polynomials which appear in a famous mathematical theorem: The Shuffle Theorem.  As the theorem gives us a way to use these polynomials to solve abstract mathematical problems that we otherwise have difficulty computing, this gives us more concrete information about some abstract questions.\n\nBeyond it's scholarly importance, this award funded the PI's participation in a number of outreach projects.  The PI presented some of this research to high school students as a speaker for the Bay Area Mathematical Adventures, giving the students an introduction to an active area of mathematical research that is understandable by students of that age.  The PI coordinated a Bay Area Discrete Math Day at Stanford, a one day conference which attracts experienced speakers in Discrete Math to present to a wide audience (particularly grad students who can afford to attend a local conference).  The PI also actively participated in various activities planned to encourage interaction and support for women in mathematics both at Stanford and nationally.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Angela S Hicks"
