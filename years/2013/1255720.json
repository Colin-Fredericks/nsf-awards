Duce Symposium\" as part of the 2013 American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting in Austin, TX from 6 to 10 January.  The theme of the symposium is \"Air-Sea Chemical Exchange: Impacts on the Atmosphere and Ocean\" and will honor Dr. Duce's distinguished contributions to research related to chemical cycles of pollutant and natural substances in the global atmosphere including atmospheric transport of chemicals from the continents, their deposition to the ocean and impact on marine biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and climate.  The symposium will also recognize his leadership of the atmospheric/oceanic science community both in the United States and internationally.  Session topics will focus on the air-sea exchange and coupling between atmospheric and marine chemistry, global biogeochemical cycles, long range transport of dust and associated effects on climate, deposition of anthropogenic pollutants to open-oceans and associated effects on oceanic biological productivities, trace gases and greenhouse gases in the marine atmosphere, and formation and transformation of marine aerosols and their climate impacts.  In addition, a joint session entitled \"Chemistry-Aerosol- Cloud/Climate Interactions: From Ocean to Continents\" will be held with the Fifth Symposium on Aerosol-Cloud-Climate Interactions and 15th Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include advancing scientific understanding of atmosphere-ocean interactions and related implication for climate.  In addition, the conference will bring together established researchers and early career scientists, providing invaluable opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive forum.  The award will provide partial support (transportation, registration, and/or per diem expenses) for the participation of approximately four young investigators (undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and one invited speaker.",
