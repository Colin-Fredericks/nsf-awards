This project focuses on two novel and complementary processing techniques for the continuous and scaled manufacturing of boride materials (solution combustion synthesis for production of the boride powders and spark plasma sintering for consolidation of the powders), as well as on fundamental studies that can eliminate critical roadblocks during scale-up for the eventual manufacturability of these advanced materials.  The project involves the participation of community college students, as well as collaborations with industrial partners.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  The purpose of this project is the creation, rational design, optimization, and scaled manufacturing of boride nanomaterials at a variety of length scales, from atomic level grain boundary engineering to macroscopic physical behavior of these materials.  It is an integrated effort that will fuse theoretical and modeling approaches to recent experimental developments in materials processing, including solution combustion synthesis and spark plasma sintering.  This project is the first study to (i) scale the combustion synthesis process for the production of boride nanomaterials, (ii) design and implement a process for the continuous manufacturing of bulk specimens by spark plasma sintering, (iii) optimize the diffusion behavior and gas storage capacity of a variety of hexaboride compounds in electric fields, and (iv) combine experimental work with molecular modeling techniques to study the diffusion of ions and gases in hexaborides.\r\n\r\nThis project on Scalable Nanomanufacturing (SNM) is co-funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Engineering (ENG) Directorates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs humanity persists in the overexploitation of the finite natural resources of our planet, it is imperative that new technologies be developed that can alleviate environmental degradation and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  In particular, our reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation must be replaced with sources of renewable energy, including solar, wind power, and others.  These technologies place significant demands on the engineering materials that can be utilized and, thus, new materials with enhanced properties need to be designed and explored.\n\n     With this in mind, the goal of this project was to design a new class of mixed divalent hexaboride materials for potential applications in hydrogen storage and thermoelectricity.  These materials consist of a divalent cation such as calcium, strontium, or barium, and six boron atoms, forming a chemical composition of CaB6, SrB6, or BaB6.  A significant effort during the execution of this project was the design of an efficient and scalable manufacturing process for the materials and the study of the atom transport and ionic conductivity.  The determination of atom transport in these materials can eventually define the overall electronic properties, thus their study is of critical importance for further development and eventual commercialization of technologies that make use of our materials.  A critical technical barrier we had to overcome is the prevention of oxidation of our materials.  In many cases the manufacturing process can result in the formation of oxides that can be detrimental to the electronic properties.\n\n     This project was also a seed for the establishment of a bi-national research Center focused on the development of materials and systems for extreme environments.  The objective of the CaliBaja Center for Resilient Materials and Systems (Centro CaliBaja de Materiales y Sistemas Resilientes) is to support and promote research activities and technology development in the CaliBaja region, with emphasis in three strong technology sectors of the region, aerospace, biomedical devices, and manufacturing, as well as to connect the humanities, environmental sciences, and social sciences to promote bi-national student mobility and scientific collaborations.\n\n     The Center brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and scholars that are highly responsive to:\n\n(1) The challenge of designing materials and systems for extreme environments such as those found in a variety of engineering applications (i.e., ultra-high temperatures, extreme pressures and deformations, radiation, acidic conditions, etc.).\n\n(2) The challenge of exploring the extreme social and economic contrasts found along the Tijuana-San Diego border, the busiest border in the world, a place where social extremes collide and converge to form a unique social fabric and an emerging bi-national identity.\n\n     Both challenges require human capital highly versed in the newest technologies and with a cultural understanding that can promote effective links between the two sides of the border.  Thus, our Center is built around the concept of designing new materials and systems for extreme environments, as well as educating a technology-focused workforce for a thriving 21st century binational region.\n\n     A major educational effort of the CaliBaja Center is the ENLACE summer research program for high school and college students, which is a 7-week residential program for students interested in science and engineering.  It encourages research among young students, as well as helping to establish and mature cross-border friendships between students from the USA and Mexico.

The students are organized in pairs, one from each side of the border, and work together in research laboratories from across the UC San Diego campus.
