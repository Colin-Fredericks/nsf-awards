The activities of marine benthos dramatically impact early diagenesis, altering material transport and reaction distributions in surface sediments and sediment-water exchange on scales of microns to centimeters. In this project, researchers at SUNY Stony Brook will continue to develop and use innovative transparent sensor foils to track in situ redox reactions associated with O2, Mn, N, Fe, S, and C, measure exoenzyme activity, and quantify carbonate dissolution to advance predictive, mechanistic-based understanding of biogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles. Results from this study will advance fundamental understanding of biogeochemical processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will provide scientific training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including those from a diversity of underrepresented groups. Results from this study will be shared with fellow scientists and the general public, increasing knowledge about the seafloor processes.",

Novel imaging sensor films (termed planar optodes) that allow real time measurement and direct visualization of sediment pore water chemistry in 2 and 3 dimensions in situ and with minimal disturbance of complex natural distributions were developed to measure dissolved H2S (high, low level) and Mn2+.  These were used together with Br- tracer and imaging sensor films for CO2, pH, and Fe2+ developed by us previously, to constrain the 2 and 3-D distributions, pathways, and dynamics of reactions associated with the decomposition of organic matter both in experimentally manipulated microcosms and in estuarine deposits.  The development of a new tool, termed a planar saturometer, was also initiated that allows direct, 2-D imaging of carbonate dissolution or precipitation in sediments, laying the basis  for future research on sedimentary reactions affected by ocean acidification.
