 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project awards scholarships up to $6,000 per year to 34 students over a two and one-half year period to pursue the following STEM degree programs at Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC): Science, Biotechnology, Mechatronics, Machine Tool Technology, Computer Aided Drafting, Industrial Maintenance, Welding, Engineering Technology, and Information Technology. The project provides support services that promote the success and retention of participating scholars to complete an associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year institution to continue pursuit of a baccalaureate degree in a STEM area.  Scholars are also provide with industry experiences through targeted strategies with assistance from established partnerships that support the successful transition of participating scholars to employment in STEM technical areas upon successful postsecondary completion.\r\n\r\nA recruitment plan is to be implemented to target potential scholars, particularly underrepresented groups, with awardees selected by a committee, comprised of grant PI and co-PIs, relevant OCTC personnel, and industry partners. The project increases participation of academically-talented, financially-disadvantaged students in postsecondary opportunities in STEM areas of demand in Kentucky and the nation. Data collected through project evaluation has the potential to be of interest to the greater academic community by providing additional insight on the effectiveness of high impact practices on the experiences of underserved students in differing STEM areas.",
