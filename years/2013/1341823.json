 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support of the attendance of 22 US-based graduate students  to attend The 24th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2013). Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. In the area of computer systems, SOSP is one of the few such leading conferences. The support requested in this proposal will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. SIGOPS is among the oldest of the ACM SIGs, and has a distinguished history of contributions to the advancement of systems research. Many of the key components of the in-formation revolution, from memory management to the Internet, secure communications protocols, net-work file systems, and ubiquitous computing, were first showcased in SIGOPS-affiliated conferences. SIGOPS is a sponsor of SOSP as well as the annual EuroSys conference.",
