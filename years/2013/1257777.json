 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this research project is to identify the interactions among chemical messengers that control behaviors.  Neuropeptides regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes.  Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult.  This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of animal experiments and computational models.  Field and laboratory studies will be combined to address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of male vertebrate behaviors. The agent-based modeling approach is especially well-suited to address this problem. Synthetic experiments with the model allow for exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests.  The model is expected to propose novel mechanisms underlying neuropeptide control of behavior.  This project thus implements a tightly controlled experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach towards understanding social behavior.  Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors.  Conserved behaviors and chemical messengers will make the empirical results and the model broadly applicable to vertebrates.  Results will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on vertebrate behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (with a 30% minority makeup) and training of graduate students in a unique inter-disciplinary environment. The data management plan includes deposition of new software at SourceForge and archiving of digital data in the PI's institutional databases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSocial behaviors such as aggression and affiliation in vertebrates arise from a complex but poorly-understood interaction between factors internal to individuals (eg, neuropeptides, systemic hormones, energy reserves) and those that are external (eg, behaviors of neighbors, spatial distribution of the social group).  This project investigated plasticity in behavior and its control by several key chemical messengers.  In addition, an agent-based model of vertebrate social interactions was developed.  This project showed that male treefrogs do not make decisions to affiliate with other males based on an amplitude-based rule of thumb at near distances but instead use specific vocal signal spectral characteristics, similar to those females use.  Males congregate in social groups with unique spatial structures, rather than being randomly distributed or broadly dispersed.  Female choice of nearby males is profoundly influenced by the neurohypophysial peptide arginine vasotocin (AVT).  Increased AVT levels in the brain increase the speed with which female treefrogs approach males for mating.  Blocking AVT receptors decreases or abolishes this behavior, which supports the hypothesis that endogenous AVT is critically involved in modulation of this affiliative behavior.  The importance of the hormone leptin, an endogenous regulator of energy reserves, was determined by mapping the brain distribution of leptin and its effects on affiliation, aggression, and metabolism.  The model showed novel mechanisms which may contribute to peptide modulation of vertebrate behaviors.  Simulations of male:female interactions show females find significantly higher quality mates when using a minimum-threshold strategy, compared to a best-of-n strategy.  The spatial distribution of males in the environment altered female costs significantly, but not the final quality of their mates.  This project thus addressed an important open question in biology related to behavioral plasticity, its modulation by chemical messengers and the interaction with the broader social group.  The interdisciplinary environment contributed to the training of 10 students directly, as well as 6 students in undergraduate research courses directly mentored by a graduate student supported on this project.  An agent-based model of social interactions was created and implemented in the open-source NetLogo environment, for broad use and modification by others.  Project data has been deposited at the University of Notre Dame digital repository and Dryad.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sunny K Boyd"
