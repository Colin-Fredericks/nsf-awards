 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, \"Graduate 10K+,\" an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade.\r\n\r\nThe University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU) are collaborating in an activity to develop and implement the Washington State Academic RedShirt (STARS) program to increase the retention rates of economically and educationally disadvantaged students who are incoming freshmen in engineering through a first-year curriculum that prepares these talented and highly motivated students for pre-engineering coursework. The STARS program is providing access to engineering degrees for 64 students per year from low-income (as defined by Pell Grant eligibility) and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds (as defined by high schools in Washington State with 50% or more of the students on free or reduced priced lunch).  The project's goal is to increase the number of economically and educationally disadvantaged students graduating with engineering degrees from WSU and UW by 225 annually.  \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the innovative and focused program based on effective evidence-based interventions to improve the success of first-year engineering students.  The STARS program is adapted from the successful GoldShirt program at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  STARS is strengthening the students' academic preparation and learning skills, connecting the students to a supportive academic and social community, providing personal and effective academic advising and counseling, building a clear and compelling understanding of the engineering profession, and providing significant financial support.  During the students' first year at WSU and UW, they are receiving intensive support for developing the academic and learning skills required to be successful in engineering through interventions such as a first-year academic preparation curriculum and residential living-learning communities. During the second year, STARS students are continuing to be actively supported as they transition to a standard pre-engineering curriculum.  The STARS program is expected to significantly increase student retention to the upper division, allowing STARS students to complete engineering degrees.   \r\n\r\nThe project's broader impacts are being realized in the comprehensive and coordinated interventions that increase the number of minority and economically disadvantaged students pursuing, succeeding, and earning degrees in engineering.  This activity, along with the ongoing activities focused on supporting community college and transfer students in STEM, presents a model for statewide collaboration across universities and community colleges to increase the retention and graduation rates in STEM.  Moreover, robust strategies and strong relationships with existing programs for recruiting underrepresented minorities, women, and economically disadvantaged students are being leveraged to recruit STARS candidates.",

Students from low-income backgrounds are typically admitted to engineering and computer science programs at lower rates due to inadequate K-12 preparation, the need to work during college, and/or being first-generation college students. Engineering and computer science disciplines lose important perspectives when students from low-income backgrounds are excluded.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>UW STARS is an intensive wraparound support program that annually serves approximately 30 students, who come from high schools in Washington where at least 30 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Effectively, it is a &ldquo;redshirt year&rdquo; in the NCAA sense: STARS students spend five years at UW, using the first year to develop the learning skills to succeed in engineering. The STARS program also provides supplemental instruction in math/chemistry/physics, culturally-aware advising, professional development, career services support, links to internships and research opportunities, and scholarships. Students are admitted directly to an engineering department or to computer science if they successfully complete STARS&rsquo; requirements. STARS&rsquo; goal is to increase the number of economically- and educationally-disadvantaged students who graduate from UW with engineering and computer science degrees. STARS is based on the successful GoldShirt program at the University of Colorado, Boulder and a parallel program has run at Washington State University for the duration of this grant.</p>\n<p>Over the five-year grant period, UW STARS enrolled 170 students.&nbsp; Of these, 40% are women, 50% are underrepresented minorities, 84% hold Pell Grants, and 70% are first-generation college students.&nbsp; Out of 119 students in STARS during the first four years of the program, 72% remain enrolled in engineering or have graduated.&nbsp; STARS students&rsquo; average grades in key prerequisite courses such as Calculus I and II and Chemistry I are on average at least 0.5 points higher (on a 4.0 scale) than the overall average grades in these courses.&nbsp; STARS students attribute their successful transitions from high school to college to the support, community, and resources STARS provides.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The STARS program&rsquo;s internal evaluation team from the Center for Evaluation &amp; Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) has followed the academic progress of UW students who are demographically and academically similar to STARS students but are not involved in the program. Comparison groups were drawn from a list of students who would have been eligible for STARS but did not apply or were not selected. For the first four cohorts, evaluation data show that STARS students had first-year retention rates in engineering that were significantly higher than those of the comparison group at the <em>p </em>&lt; .001 level.&nbsp; For the first three cohorts, STARS students also had second-year retention rates in engineering that were significantly higher than those of the comparison group at the <em>p </em>&lt; .001 level.&nbsp; Further, survey data show that, compared with non-STARS pre-engineers, STARS students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are more attached to the field of engineering; </li>\n<li>feel a greater sense of belonging to the College of Engineering community; </li>\n<li>are more confident in their math and science abilities; </li>\n<li>are more confident in their time management, networking, and interviewing skills; </li>\n<li>are more familiar with campus resources; and </li>\n<li>are more comfortable asking for help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To date, 19 STARS students have graduated with degrees in engineering or computer science.
