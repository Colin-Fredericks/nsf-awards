 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computing systems require manipulation of persistent\r\ndata. However, the mechanisms to access persistent data are separated\r\nfrom the mechanisms to manipulate such data in a traditional two-level\r\nstorage model: persistent data is stored in non-volatile storage, such\r\nas hard disks or solid-state disks, whereas it is manipulated in\r\nvolatile memory, such as DRAM.  Unfortunately, this decoupled model of\r\nsystem design leads to large amounts of inefficiency in terms of both\r\nperformance and energy.\r\n\r\nThis research undertakes a rethinking of the memory and storage\r\nsystems in the presence of new and emerging non-volatile memory\r\ntechnologies such as phase-change memory , spin-transfer torque RAM,\r\nand memristors. These technologies promise large capacities at low\r\nlatency, making them prime candidates for the design of a single-level\r\ncoordinated memory and storage system where the manipulation and\r\nstorage of all data are unified. Yet, there are significant\r\napplication-level and system-level efficiency and correctness\r\nchallenges in devising such a single-level store with emerging\r\ntechnologies. The central goal of this project is to develop\r\nhardware/software cooperative techniques to enable high-performance\r\nand energy-efficient single-level stores in computer systems targeting\r\na wide range of applications in cloud computing, client systems, and\r\nmobile systems.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that research performed in this project will enable new\r\napplications and much more robust and efficient data storage systems,\r\nmaking our daily lives that increasingly depend on data processing\r\nbetter and more productive. Enabling unified memory and storage for\r\nmodern computing systems can largely reduce wasted work and take\r\nadvantage of emerging low-power technologies, thereby taking a large\r\nstep in making computing more energy efficient.",
