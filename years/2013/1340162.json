AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) is the major professional association for AI. At the Doctoral Consortium (DC), PhD students who are pursuing work on AI-related topics present their proposed research and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers, as well as from other student participants. This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and also enables them to explore their career objectives.",

The DC was co-chaired by Prof Peter McBurney, King's College London (UK) and Prof Ayanna Howard, Georgia Institute of Techology (USA). The specific goals of the DC were as follows: (1) To provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; (3) To support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths; and (4) To contribute to the AAAI conference goals through interaction with other researchers and participation in conference events. All of these goals were met. The DC took place over two days, and incorporated student presentations followed by feedback from mentors assigned to each student and panels, as well as social events to encourage informal discussion. Sixteen doctoral students attended the DC, eleven of whom were from US institutions and funded by NSF. Each was mentored by a senior researcher in the student's field of research. An ice-breaker event and career advice panel was also held, in which topics such as job search and early career advice were discussed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/02/2014<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ayanna&nbsp;Howard</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
