Similar NMHC measurements from other high-altitude sites (i.e. Pico Mountain, Jungfraujoch, Hohenpeissenberg) will be compared to the Summit data to establish background conditions and determine whether Summit, in comparison to other sites, is subjected to more or less transport at different times of year. Positive matrix factorization will be used as a tool to decipher emissions sources and their contributions to Arctic pollution events. FLEXPART-based transport modeling studies will be incorporated to perform source region allocations of pollution events. \r\n\r\nThis research is supported under the AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program.",

NMHCs are an important class of compounds as many of them can be highly reactive in the atmosphere and contribute to the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone (an EPA regulated compound) and atmospheric aerosols, both of which have negative impacts on air quality and human health. Certain NMHCs, such as benzene and toluene, that are often emitted from anthropogenic activities, are also considered to be air toxics with adverse health side-effects from prolonged exposure. This NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Atmospheric &amp; Geospace Sciences focused on the study of anthropogenic non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and ozone, and associated air quality impacts, both near source locations and through long-range transport to the remote Polar Regions, utilizing a combination of field measurements and atmospheric modeling. Through analysis of long-term measurements of NMHCs, NO<sub>x</sub>, and ozone at Summit, Greenland, along with FLEXPART retroplume modeling analysis, we determined that anthropogenic pollution events characterized by enhancements in alkanes, benzene, acetylene and NO<sub>x</sub> (and typically decreases in ozone), were routinely transported long distances to the Greenland ice cap from Europe and Asia, primarily during the winter and spring months. Biomass burning plumes mostly originated from North America and Eastern Asia during the summer months, though these events were much less frequent, and were often associated with enhancements in ozone. These analyses provided evidence that anthropogenic pollution from the mid-latitudes could often be transported long distances and had the potential to impact air quality (e.g., through ozone enhancements) in even very remote regions. Investigations of air quality impacts of anthropogenic emissions near sources focused upon NMHC and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from oil and natural gas production activities in the Western United States and associated tropospheric ozone production. During the NOAA-led Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies (UBWOS), we conducted balloon-borne vertical profile measurements of NMHCs, NO<sub>x</sub>, and ozone to a height of 500 ft and within the surface snowpack. In this study, we observed exceptionally elevated levels of NMHCs, up to 1200 ppbv ethane, that corresponded to elevated tropospheric ozone events (up to 150 ppbv) that would last several days during strong temperature inversion events. This unusual high wintertime ozone phenomenon was linked to high emissions of oil and gas compounds and strong temperature inversions that acted to pool emissions within the basin. In addition to Utah, Dr. Thompson (formerly Stephens) also conducted sampling of NMHC in residential areas of the Denver-Julesburg Basin in the Colorado Front Range in response to requests from a local citizen activist group concerned over oil and gas emissions from wells near their homes. Results from this effort revealed enhancements in many NMHCs associated with oil and gas, as well as higher levels of benzene in towns within the gas field than in the urban Denver Metro area. This work was highly publicized and Dr. Thompson was interviewed for both local (e.g., Denver Post, Durango Herald) and national (e.g., EnergyWire, Bloomberg News) media outlets.
