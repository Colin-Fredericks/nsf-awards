Devising new techniques to efficiently and safely exploit multiple cores is the central question facing language designers, compiler writers, and system architects.\r\n\r\nTo help address these challenges, this NSF sponsored workshop will identify future research directions related to High-Level Programming Models for Parallelism, and the transition of such research to industrial practice.  The workshop will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government research labs working in the area of parallelism, including algorithms, architecture, language design and implementation, and runtime systems. The workshop will identify primary challenges in the field, both foundational and infrastructural, and will address the transition of ideas from research to practice.",
