 "awd_abstract_narration": "This long-term project tests the hypothesis that insect herbivory is a major factor influencing recovery of natural communities following catastrophic disturbance, a process known as primary succession. Since Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, field surveys and experiments have been used to quantify the impacts of herbivores on two key community members - lupins, which facilitate soil development, and willows, which provide the main source of three dimensional vegetation structure required by many animals. Over the next five years, these approaches will be continued in order to determine how effects of herbivores on host plants are linked to community development, if these effects attenuate as communities become more complex, and the factors that cause herbivore effects to vary across space. \r\n\r\nResults from this study have revealed previously unrecognized mechanisms that influence the recovery of natural communities from catastrophic disturbances such as volcanic eruptions. The project provides long-term data essential to management and restoration efforts.  The project also enhances science education through student involvement and work with the National Volcanic Monument and its non-profit partner, the Mount St. Helens Institute. The researchers will assist the Mount St. Helens Institute in developing resources that enable high school science classes to participate in research at the site.",

This question is at the heart of our research on Mount St. Helens Pumice Plain. Its 1980 eruption buried our field site by up to 200m of rock, then blanketed it with flows of 800 ?C pumice, birthing a biology-free landscape. Under our Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) award we investigated decadal scale effects of insect herbivores as they feed on two key colonizing plants, alpine lupin (<em>Lupinus lepidus</em>) and Sitka willow (<em>Salix sitchensis</em>). Alpine lupin was the first plant to colonize new surfaces, where it began to create soil and facilitated other plants and animals that otherwise could not persist. Sitka willow was the first woody plant to become widespread in both wetland and upland habitats. In many temperate regions willow is often a transformational pioneer species, shading out other colonists, and creating 3-dimensional habitat structure required by most birds and small mammals.</p>\n<p>Pioneering lupins were themselves rapidly colonized by native moths in the early 1990s. At that time we showed that moth larvae dramatically reduced lupin population growth, slowing their spread across the landscape. With the LTREB award we extended a long-term documentation of the impact of moth larvae to 25 years, and repeated experimental insect exclusions that reveal their impact. We found that at low plant density, damage was chronically high (&gt;40% consumption), and experimental exclusion demonstrated that insects continue to dramatically reduce population growth. However, at high plant densities the effect of moth larvae is reduced to near 0, and the portion of the landscape at low density is decreasing.&nbsp; We hypothesize that as communities of plants and animals become more complex, consumers such as insect herbivores are suppressed by predators and competitors. Indeed, we demonstrated that at high plant density, lupins become a poor food resource for herbivores.</p>\n<p>Sitka willow is attacked by the larvae of an invasive European weevil, <em>Cryptorhyncus lapathi</em>. Although non-native, this weevil typically is not very damaging elsewhere in the region. We found that from 2006 to 2018, 64% of willow stem mass was attacked, and 55% was killed annually. This is not true in wetlands, where only 17% of stem mass died. Our experiments show that attack in uplands dramatically alters the assembling plant community: exclusion of weevils for 10 years caused an 11x increase in willow mass and eliminated plant mortality. Suppression of weevils has a variety of consequences, including a 2x-7x increase soil organic matter accumulation.</p>\n<p>In addition to the effects on these two keystone species, we have noted other cases in our system where insect herbivores have an outsized impact. &nbsp;Our work suggests insect herbivory can be a major factor influencing the recovery of plant communities from a major disturbance, and that many species interactions are highly unstable following a large disturbance.&nbsp; We hypothesize that this instability is more pronounced after very large scale and severe disturbances such as the 1980 eruption, where isolation and limited dispersal prevents the arrival of ?buffer species? that might keep insect effects in check.</p>\n<p>Our LTREB award supported students investigating related topics. Examples include:&nbsp; 1) Willow sex ratio. Two-thirds of willows are females; we eliminated several frequently hypothesized environmental factors as causes, concluding it is likely genetically based. 2) Effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution. We demonstrated that small increase in nitrogen pollution increase willow growth by 50%, but only when willows were not attacked by weevils. N addition increased total insect abundance (but not weevils) while decreasing diversity. 3) Plant community surveys from 2010 to 2016 revealed an increas from 45% to 67% ground cover &nbsp;by plants, while the number of species increased from 107 to 155, indicating a rapid acceleration of community assembly after 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts.</strong> Project personnel contributed substantively to broadening science participation and exposure to scientific ideas through intensive involvement in science education opportunities at WSU, the US Forest Service, the Mount St. Helens Institute (MSHI), and public outreach opportunities. We continued contributing critical support for the MSHI?s education and rec-ed programs, such as their Geo-Girls, High School STEM project, and others (see mshinstitute.org for programs), as well as for organizational development. This award supported research training for 32 undergraduate and 17 recently graduated students, and completion of 6 MS and 2 PhD degrees. Senior scientist Charlie Crisafulli edited and co-wrote a book on Mount St. Helens ecology for both the public and scientists. We gave over 60 presentations to audiences at universities, conferences, public venues, and a variety of NGOs. In addition, by revealing mechanisms governing the re-assembly of communities following catastrophic disturbance, our work strengthens the theoretical basis of applied restoration ecology.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bishop</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569891908458_DSC08053highdenslupin--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569891908458_DSC08053highdenslupin--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lupins at high density\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569891908458_DSC08053highdenslupin--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lupins at high density\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">At high plant density, lupins are rarely attacked by their leaf-feeding insect herbivores because competition decreases leaf nutrient content.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Bishop</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bishop</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lupins at high density</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569892524393_DSC07755lupinprotected--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569892524393_DSC07755lupinprotected--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Alpine lupins after herbivore exclusion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1257360/1257360_10234105_1569892524393_DSC07755lupinprotected--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Alpine lupins after herbivore exclusion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The blue flowers reveal a low-density plot where lupins have been protected from specialist insect herbivores.
