 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth?s cryosphere holds large capacity to alter planetary reflectance and surface temperature through albedo feedback, partially explaining the high sensitivity of Arctic climate. Albedo feedback, however, is actually composed of multiple mechanisms operating on timescales ranging from hours to millennia, both within snowpack and via altered cryospheric cover. This project aims to fill crucial gaps in our understanding of: 1) how light-absorbing impurities like black carbon (BC) influence albedo feedback via their effect on snow metamorphism, and 2) sources of decadal to multi-decadal variability in albedo feedback and explanation of why climate models universally underestimate 1979?2008 boreal albedo feedback (by ~2-fold) relative to remote sensing observations. Motivation for goal (1) arises from radiative modeling and observations showing that BC perturbs visible albedo more in coarser-grained (aged) snow, which is also darker in the near-infrared spectrum, indicating that BC triggers at least two positive albedo feedback mechanisms when it accelerates snow metamorphism. The influence of impurity heating on metamorphism, however, is uncertain. The PI will measure the evolution of snow effective grain size in snowpacks generated with and without BC, using a new near-infrared optical sensing device, to determine BC influence on metamorphism in one environment. Goal (2) is motivated by the observed bias in model feedback and a preliminary analysis showing large multi-decadal feedback variability in transient climate simulations. To isolate contributions to albedo feedback and identify causes of model-observation discrepancy and multi- decadal variability in feedback, he will incorporate diagnostic cryosphere radiative forcing terms into the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) and conduct additional analyses with remote sensing and climate model data. Expectation of a long-term decline in albedo feedback associated with reduced cryospheric cover prompts the questions: Has albedo feedback peaked? If not, when might it, and why? Attaining the project objectives will enable modeling albedo feedback more consistently across scales, quantifying climate and hydrological influences of anthropogenic aerosol emissions more confidently, and providing a mechanistic explanation for the timing of peak albedo feedback in a warming world.\r\n\r\nResearch will be tightly integrated with undergraduate and graduate education. Snow impurity/metamorphism experiments and optical measurements will be part of a weekend research experience designed for freshmen at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). Students will gain exposure to winter field methods, instrumentation, measurements of energy and trace gas fluxes at station towers, and data interpretation. Student teams will deploy on Lake Douglas and other terrain at UMBS to measure snow properties and characterize spatial variability in grain size. This activity will be targeted toward early undergraduate students to influence degree major choices and interest in science career paths. Participating seniors may design, build, and apply field instruments for engineering course credit. Graduate studies of cryosphere?climate interactions will be incorporated into a course project in one of the PI?s courses. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental research resulting from this project will enhance understanding of important climate feedback processes, how industrial emissions influence these processes, and how they may impact water resources.  The integration of this research with educational activities will contribute to the training of the next generation of geoscientists and engineers.",

Different components of albedo feedback operate across a vast range of scales, however, spanning snow microstructure to the global scale. Understanding the importance of these feedbacks will help to constrain the magnitude of climate change that results from anthropogenic activity. This project aimed to bridge our understanding of albedo feedback by quantifying its importance across different scales of space and time.</p>\n<p>One outcome of this project was the successful design, fabrication, and deployment of a new device (depicted in Figure 1) to efficiently monitor the optical grain size of snow. As snow ages, the average size of its ice grains tends to increase, leading to lower reflectance, particularly in the near-infrared part of the solar spectrum (where humans cannot see). Warmer snow tends to \"age\" more rapidly, implying potential for amplifying feedbacks that involve snow temperature. One way in which snow temperature is perturbed is through the deposition of light-absorbing particles like soot and dust. This motivated the question: <em>Does dirty snow age more rapidly</em>? If so, the deposition of pollutants like soot will accelerate snow melt both by directly increasing solar heating in the visible spectrum, and also <em>indirectly</em> by causing snow grains to grow larger and increasing solar heating in the near-infrared spectrum. To assess this, we deployed our new instrument in controlled field studies to monitor the evolution of grain size in clean and artificially-contaminated snow. These measurements showed conclusively that dirty snow ages more rapidly (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>We also studied the importance of albedo feedback at the global scale. As part of this effort, we incorporated into an Earth System Model a new diagnostic measure called the <em>cryosphere radiative effect</em>, which describes the amount of additional solar energy that gets reflected back to space because of the presence of snow and ice. We then conducted model simulations with this new diagnostic to quantify how much more solar energy Earth could absorb in the future due to snow and sea-ice changes. Under the most pessimistic scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, simulations with the Community Earth System Model showed that Earth will absorb an additional 800 terawatts (800 trillion watts) of solar power by the end of the 21st&nbsp;century due to reduced coverage and optical properties of snow and ice (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>A related study that we undertook examined how simulated global albedo feedback varies on decadal- to multidecadal timescales in climate models. We utilized an archive of output from 36 models simulating the most pessimistic scenario of emissions and found, contrary to our expectations, that albedo feedback does not weaken throughout the 21<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">st</span>&nbsp;century in the majority of models, despite those models exhibiting substantial reductions in snow and sea-ice coverage. This suggests that albedo feedback will likely continue amplifying climate change to a similar degree as it currently does, until at least 2100, after which losses of snow and sea-ice could become so large as to weaken the feedback. Another component of this study explored the question: <em>Given that feedbacks vary on decadal and multidecadal timescales, is our 40-year record of global satellite observations sufficiently long to provide us with a reasonable observational constraint of the inherent feedback strength</em>? Encouragingly, the answer, judging from modeled variability in feedback strength and temperature change, is \"yes\".</p>\n<p>Finally, a key part of CAREER awards is the integration of research and education. In June of 2019 the PI co-led a 10-day expedition to Greenland with 13 undergraduate students from 3 institutions (the University of Michigan, SUNY-Albany, and Virginia Tech.). Students gained valuable experience in conducting atmospheric and hydrologic measurements in a remote polar environment, camping for two nights near a glacier to make measurements, visiting the Summit Station science observatory (Figure 4) via a U.S. Air National Guard LC-130, and trekking to the historic Mt. Evans site where University of Michigan researchers conducted some of the earliest aerological measurements over Greenland in the 1920's. Students learned how to measure shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes (Figure 5), aerosol optical depth, stream flow, and vertical profiles of atmospheric variables via radiosonde launches. Early indications suggest this was an impactful experience for students, and include one student earning a prestigious fellowship to return to Greenland for a full year, and another student leading a commentary piece on their experience that was published in the widely circulated American Geophysical Union periodical <em>Eos</em>.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Flanner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253154/1253154_10246128_1594404535092_fgr_Schneider19_2a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253154/1253154_10246128_1594404535092_fgr_Schneider19_2a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1253154/1253154_10246128_1594404535092_fgr_Schneider19_2a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: The Near-Infrared Emitting and Reflectance-Monitoring Dome (NERD)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Schneider et al.
