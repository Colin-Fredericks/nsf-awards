 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several precariously balanced rocks (PBRs) in the western US\r\nlocated on hill-sides and cliffs. Many of these rocks have evolved\r\nnaturally and have been in their present configuration for thousands of\r\nyears. Cosmogenic dating of the pedestal, rock and other surfaces on\r\nthe surrounding landscape has been conducted to estimate the amount\r\nof time these rocks have remained precarious. Through analysis, if we\r\ncan establish the nature of ground shaking that would cause these\r\nrocks to topple, we can confidently state that such motion could not\r\nhave occurred during the \"precarious age\" of the rock. Thus, these\r\nrocks are effectively low-resolution strong motion seismoscopes that\r\nprovide strong statistical constraints on ground motion from historic\r\nearthquakes in the region. Such information is critical for the\r\nproper siting and designing of nuclear/chemical power plants and\r\nwaste storage facilities to protect them against plausible ground\r\nshaking from long-term future earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this research are: (i) to develop a fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the mechanics of rocking and sliding of precariously\r\nbalanced rocks (PBRs) under earthquake excitation; (ii) to\r\ncharacterize the sensitivity of the overturning of PBRs to ground\r\nmotion features; (iii) to use PBRs to help establish the veracity of\r\nground motion simulations; and (iv) to estimate the upper bounds of\r\nseismic shaking intensity in a given region or a specific site,\r\nperhaps where hazardous materials are handled (e.g., nuclear or\r\nchemical waste storage facilities or plants). We plan to achieve the\r\nproject goals by combining recently developed 3-D imaging (Terrestrial\r\nLaser Scanning) and image processing techniques with a recently\r\ndeveloped rigid body dynamics algorithm to create high-fidelity 3-D\r\nmodels of existing precariously balanced rocks and the supporting\r\npedestals. The models will strive to mimic the physical condition of\r\ncontact to credibly capture the interplay of sliding and rocking when\r\nthe pedestal is shaken by 3-component ground excitation. The investigators propose\r\nto validate the analysis algorithm using data from shake table tests\r\non regular blocks and irregular rocks. They intend to conduct\r\nparametric analyses of several PBRs subjected to idealized waveform\r\nexcitation characterized by frequency, amplitude, and number of\r\ncycles. This will help establish the toppling sensitivity of the\r\nrocks to these ground motion features. Using these toppling analyses,\r\nwe plan to compute statistical bounds on the values of various ground\r\nmotion features from historical earthquakes that have occurred at the\r\nsites of the PBRs. These results will not only help inform future\r\neditions of the National Seismic Hazard maps but also help guide the\r\nsiting and design of critical nuclear and chemical facilities. In\r\naddition, they plan to excite the PBRs with 3-component acceleration\r\nhistories predicted for these sites by seismic wave propagation\r\nsimulations of past earthquakes. If the synthetic excitation is found\r\nto overturn the PBR models, it would point to shortcomings in the\r\nground motion simulation methodology. Alternately, the absence of\r\noverturning would lend credibility to seismic wave propagation\r\nsimulations.",

We are applying this algorithm to precariously balanced rocks to understand the nature of ground shaking that will topple these rocks.  Such studies can help identify an upper-bound on the intensity and nature of shaking at the site of the PBR during the precarious age of the rock which may run into thousands of years.  Such studies can help us define the 10000-year earthquake needed for the design of nuclear waste repositories.  We have also used this algorithm to estimate the free-field ground motion at site of the North Anna nuclear power plant where the 2011 magnitude 5.8 Mineral Virginia earthquake caused sliding of 1-4.5 inches in 25 of the 27 spent fuel casks.  We have modeled the casks in 3-D and conducted fragility analysis using several past earthquake records to estimate the nature of shaking that would cause the casks to slide this amount.
