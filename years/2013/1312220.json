 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating laser cooling techniques from the science of atomic physics to fill a gap in the technology of precision sensors. The translated science has a unique combination of high sensitivity, good stability, and excellent reproducibility, which provide exemplary performance and efficacy when compared to the leading competing technologies of mechanical and electronic sensors. The project accomplishes this goal by developing new vacuum techniques resulting in a prototype glass cell that will enable laser cooling in a commercially practical device. The partnership engages Triad Technology, Inc to provide guidance in the spectroscopic cell market space and other aspects such as financing and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. \r\n\r\n The potential economic impact is expected to be up to one billion dollars in the next twenty years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the precision sensor market. The societal impact, long term, will be significant improvement in a wide range of vital technologies, including vehicle navigation, energy exploration, threat detection, and secure communication.\r\n\r\n",
