 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Wood Based Composites (WBC) located at the Oregon State University (OSU). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\r\nThis project will test the hypothesis that the ability of a wood-adhesive bond to resist degradation due to water intrusion is dependent on penetration of the resin into the cell walls of wood. The project proposes to quantitatively measure adhesive penetration in 3D and in multiple scales, and then correlate the results with adhesive bond performance. Multiple spatial scale of analysis is needed to detect moisture-induced deformation of adhesive bonds and interaction of pre-polymer with the cell wall. This effort is a fundamental approach to solving the long-standing problem of durability of wood-based composites and it compliments an ongoing research project sponsored by the I/UCRC for Wood-Based Composites (WBC). \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will support the development of better wood composite materials and directly assist manufacturers of wood composites and adhesives. The impact of the research will be realized through direct involvement of the industry members of the WBC, technical reports to be distributed to the WBC members, publication in technical journals and conference proceedings to a broader science and technology audience, as well as inclusion in college courses and short courses. Student involvement in research is a point of emphasis for the WBC, and recruitment efforts place high priority on inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. If successful, results from the proposed project will remove speculation concerning influence of cell wall penetration on moisture resistance of adhesive bonds in wood and provide guidance for new adhesive formulation to improve moisture resistance or reduce adhesive costs.",

Improving moisture resistance extends the durability and useful life of buildings made from these wood products. Wood is a very porous material, and adhesion depends on the ability of adhesives to penetrate into the porous network of cells. The hypothesis is that molecular penetration of adhesive into the cell wall improves moisture resistance. Moisture resistance of wood composite products is typically the most difficult performance criteria. Since wood experiences dimensional change with change in moisture content, adhesive bonds are stressed, and sometimes compromised, when exposed to changing environment conditions. Penetration of adhesive into wood prior to polymerization, and then subsequent curing, serves two functions &ndash; more disperse distribution of stress at interfaces between cell wall material and cured adhesive, and reduction of moisture transport in the region of the adhesive bond. Both phenomena would improve resistance to the negative effects of moisture intrusion.</p>\n<p>The research tested the performance adhesive against accelerated weathering treatments, which subjected the specimens to drastic changes of moisture content. Mechanical tests were performed on specimens before and after exposure to accelerated weathering. The specimens were made from either, an adhesive that readily penetrated the wood, or one that had modest penetration. The only difference between the adhesives was their molecular weight distribution. Adhesive penetration was measured using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) that provided spatial resolution of 60 to 1400 nanometers. The results indicated that greater penetration correlated with improved resistance to moisture. Due to the difficulty in producing XCT data, variability of the wood and, consequently, low number of replications, the results only confirm the hypothesis and did not provide sufficient evidence to derive predictive trends. This was the first reported study of adhesive bonds using micro- and nano-XCT. Therefore, future study may provide information needed to formulate adhesives with greater moisture resistance.</p>\n<p>The project supported two graduate students and provided training for the students on unique equipment at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. One student has completed a MS degree and has been hired by one of the industry advisor for this project. The other student has participated in two internships at the Advanced Photon Source, and intends to pursue employment at the laboratory after graduation. Results have been widely distributed by publication in scientific journals and presentation at numerous conferences. In addition, a committee of industry advisors have closely followed the project and have implemented results into their own product development. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Frederick&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kamke</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331043/1331043_10257845_1490998750085_IMG_1100--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331043/1331043_10257845_1490998750085_IMG_1100--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nano-XCT beamline\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331043/1331043_10257845_1490998750085_IMG_1100--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nano-XCT beamline\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Oregon State University MS student, Paige McKinley, working on nano-XCT beamline (32-ID) at Advanced Photon Source</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">F.
