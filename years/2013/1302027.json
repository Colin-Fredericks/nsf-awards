These workshops will improve the current research in this area, lead to greater accumulation of findings in the future and provide guidance to those in as well as those consider work in this area of research.  The Consortium will also attempt to provide the framework within which data projects could be better coordinated with one another and courses taught on the subject at diverse venues around the globe.",
