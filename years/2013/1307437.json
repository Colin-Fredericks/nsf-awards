 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project the investigators construct statistical methods and algorithms for SNP analysis that are designed to enhance the biological realism of the underlying models. This project has three primary aims. The first extends development of a new method for constructing hierarchical trees from sequence data using maximum likelihood and modal inference. The tree construction is based upon application of either one of these two inference methods to an ancestral mixture model, a model whose parameters describe the population structure at each fixed time point T in the past.  If one estimates this structure over a fine grid of time points T, the relationship between the estimates over time can be graphically described as a hierarchical tree. The second project aim is to enhance the biological realism of the ancestral mixture model to include (a) multi-state characters, (b) advanced models of sequence evolution, and (c) recombination. The extensions are based on using diffusion kernels constructed from continuous time Markov Chains. Empirical Bayes methods are also proposed to be employed to improve overall estimation precision. The third aim is development of a new method for reconstructing haplotype sequences from genotype data without knowing the parental information. The methods and algorithms are based on the ancestral mixture models together with a multi-moment approach that simplifies computation. In addition, the investigators propose to extend the method to long sequences by sliding a window along longer genotype sequences, then using the information from the overlapping estimates to construct longer haplotype estimates.\r\n\r\nThe current release of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's(NCBI) database dbSNP contains over 11.5 million human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) records, representing a 10-fold increase over the last 4 years. Analysis of such data has become a focus of much research within bioinformatics and computational biology because it is the SNPs that carry the information that distinguishes the individuals within a species. Encoded in this data is important information about the relationship between the characteristics of an individual and their genetic code. The investigators are developing methods and models for this data that are fundamentally different in approach from the standard techniques currently used in two areas where SNP data is used, coalescent and phylogenetic inference, in which one reconstructs genetic relationships similar to family trees based on the current ancestors only. The broader impacts of this project include the development of methods and models with potential wide ranging uses across broad scientific disciplines, the increased fusion of biological and mathematical innovation, and opportunities for broad interdisciplinary training of diverse students.\r\n\r\n",

These packages can reconstruct phylogeny using developed ancestral mixture models with three different optimization algorithms implemented and automatic colorizing and visual annotating of the tree.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;An example using a published population study revealed by mitochondria DNA Lineages was introduced as a moderate case study. Evolutionary history of mitochondria DNA is widely used in not only assessing the origin of human beings, but also reconstructing historical evidence among species. Mitochondria DNA is maternally inherited which is capable of tracing the maternal lineage far back in time. The genetic components in mitochondria DNA are important for keeping genes with vital functions corresponding to energy production from generation to generation, although the mutation rate was estimated to be significantly higher than average mutation rate in nucleus genome. &nbsp;A set of mitochondria DNA sequences from Hmong-Mien populations in East Asia was used as case control in our model (Wen <em>et al.</em>, 2005). The East Asian belongs to Eurasian mtDNA in two supergroups M (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 1995) and N (Alves-Silva <em>et al.</em>, 2000), which have polymorphism at nucleotide position 10400 and other coding region sites rooted from African L3 haplotype. The branches of supergoup M include haplogroup C, D, E, G, Z, while the supergroup N contains haplogroup A, B, F, R, Y. Each of branches could have more subfamilies since more novel haplotypes were found in human populations. The dataset contains 215 base-pair long mitochondria DNA sequence in hypervariable segment 1 (HVS1) region for each 537 distinct individual. All individuals were described into 17 populations with the ethnicity, residency and language. These populations were categorized into two major linguistic subfamilies, which are Hmong and Mien. There are 4 out of 17 Hmong-speaking populations, with two official ethnics Miao and Yao. Other Mien-speaking populations are all Yao in ethnicity. Every individual among populations here could be determined to the supergroup M and N, and the branch it belongs to, by the polymorphisms in mtDNA sequences. The haplotypes of each sample were also well defined based on previous studies (Kong <em>et al.</em>, 2003), which is a reference for us as the validation of simulating results.&nbsp; Among 537 individuals, 273 HVS1 haplotypes were observed, 74 of which are shared by at least two individuals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The lineage of East Asia mitochondria DNA has two major groups that are M and N. 43% samples belong to supergroup M with descendent haplogroups M7, M8, M8a, C, Z ,D and G, while 57% of them account for haplogroup A, B, F, R9, R, N9a and Y, which are encompassed by supergroup N. After reconstructing phylogeny using MixtureTree v3.3 and MixtureTree Annotator v1.0, we could see that haplotype B was the distinct group from others with low diversity within group in both estimation (Figures). It is concluded that haplotype F was the branch from haplotype R9 in previous observation (Tao <em>et al</em>., 2002). The haplogroups could be classified clearly by the FixedEM and modalEM. The individuals which are classified to the same haplogroup could be clustered and distributed closely in the rooted phylogenetic tree. The results generated by FixedEM and modalEM also shared similar topologies, though some of individuals could not be clustered into haplogroups in FixedEM result. The haplogroup F and R9, which have common alleles in the HVS1 region in mtDNA, are clustered in one branch in both results. This could also be proved by the study of Kivisild <em>et al</em>. (2002), especially in their Figure 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition, the PI also hosts a research website, mixturetree.net, to release the computer packages produced from the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/12/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shu-Chuan&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307232753_fixedEM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307232753_fixedEM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FixedEM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307232753_fixedEM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FixedEM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MixtureTree via fixed EM</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shu-Chuan&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FixedEM</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307277438_modalEM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307277438_modalEM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ModalEM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307277438_modalEM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ModalEM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mixturetree of H-M Population via modal EM</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shu-Chuan&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ModalEM</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307339316_mixturetree_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307339316_mixturetree_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MixtureTree program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307437/1307437_10023086_1476307339316_mixturetree_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MixtureTree program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MixtureTree Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shu-Chuan&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MixtureTree program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
