 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize an\r\nactive driving aid that enables semi-autonomous, cooperative navigation of an electric-powered wheelchair\r\n(EPW) both indoors and in dynamic, outdoor environments. It uses intelligent sensing and drive control\r\nsystems that work in cooperation with the driver to aid in negotiating changing terrain, avoiding obstacles/\r\ncollisions, and maintaining a straight path. Additionally, the system allows for higher-level path planning\r\nand the autonomous execution of non-linear routes of travel in a safe and efficient manner. The goal of\r\nthe project is to enable active, safe, and independent living. The innovation is that as an individual begins to\r\nlose cognitive, perceptive, or motor function ? due to age, injury, or disease ? the system can augment that\r\nloss because it can interpret the user?s intent and it can ?see? out into the environment on their behalf. This\r\nexteroceptive sensing capability is enabled by leveraging the latest in 3D imaging technology. The team will\r\nexploit their experience in commercializing smart-EPW technologies (including acquiring FDA approval),\r\nand will apply the knowledge they have gained in developing autonomous driving solutions through their\r\nparticipation in the DARPA Urban Challenge.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have significant impacts in the U.S. Socially,\r\nit will have a direct positive effect on the quality of life and independence of the elderly and disabled.\r\nLeveraging robotics for personal mobility can help Americans with disabilities to participate fully in basic\r\nactivities such as employment, education, worship, recreation, and other activities of community life often\r\ntaken for granted. Economically, a serious side effect of the rapidly growing elder population, to over 70\r\nmillion by 2030, is that it will place unprecedented strains on the U.S. healthcare system. This impact can\r\nbe moderated in part by enabling individuals to maintain their independence and live at home longer. It is\r\nestimated that adding a single month of independence and health to America?s elder population would save\r\n$5 billion, while decreasing hospitalization and institutionalization 10% would save $50 billion annually.\r\nAs a result, technology for home-centered approaches to healthcare, such as the proposed system, are necessary.\r\nIn research terms, while the immediate focus is in the field of assistive robotics, this research will be\r\nextendable to general field and service robotics as much of the work is related to 3D perception.",
