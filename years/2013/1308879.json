 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pollination by sexual deceit is well known in the orchid family. This unusual system has been studied in detail for many temperate, terrestrial orchid lineages, but rarely in the New World. In the Neotropical orchid genus Mormolyca, sexual deception has evolved along with food reward and food deception, thereby providing an opportunity to explore correlations between flower morphology and scent. This research incorporates techniques from multiple disciplines (molecular evolution, micro-morphology and chemical ecology) in an attempt to gain a holistic picture of evolutionary processes underlying lineage diversification of an orchid group with multiple pollination systems.\r\nGiven that the Neotropics harbor an impressive number of orchid species, this integrated approach should be especially helpful in understanding this biodiversity hotspot. The research is helping to train a Ph.D. student in modern approaches to molecular systematics and chemical ecology. It will allow him to continue serving as a mentor to undergraduate students, and significantly enhance the impact his dissertation will have on the discipline. Not only scientific papers, but also products for a broader audience will be made available in orchid society publications and websites devoted to orchid enthusiasts.  Educational activities focused on orchid pollination also will be developed based on the results for K?12 outreach events.",
