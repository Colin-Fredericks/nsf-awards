 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John D. Gilbertson of Western Washington University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop bioinspired, pyridinediimine (PDI) metal complexes containing redox-active, ?non-innocent? ligands.  These systems consist of nucleophilic/basic substrate directors and/or H-bond/proton-directors in the secondary coordination sphere, as well as ligand-based redox active sites in the ligand scaffold.  These ligands will be used to synthesize catalysts containing earth abundant metals and will be studied in order to develop extensive knowledge concerning the molecular level catalytic activity and selectivity for the conversion of carbon dioxide into useable feedstocks and fuels (namely CO, methane, etc.).  The investigation of these bioinspired conversions of carbon dioxide will provide a better understanding of how the secondary coordination sphere of metalloenzyme mimics can be regulated to provide better structural/functional biomimics.  These data, in turn, will be utilized to design structural/functional mimics that are active in the useful, bioinspired transformations of carbon dioxide. In addition to the investigation of carbon dioxide reduction, an outreach program consisting of undergraduate researchers and WWU chemistry majors that aims to introduce chemistry into the local media will be developed.   \r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide is a significant environmental contaminant and sensible methods of carbon dioxide utilization are needed for its mitigation as a greenhouse gas. The production of CO (or methane) from carbon dioxide is an attractive route to the utilization of carbon dioxide as a feedstock.  Carbon dioxide is inexpensive and abundant, and it is important that catalysts utilized for its conversion(s) into renewable products contain metals that are also inexpensive and abundant (such as iron, cobalt, and zinc).",

Examples of these are hydrogen/carbon dioxide activation for fuel production, dinitrogen activation for ammonia production, and nitrite activation for environmental remediation.  In both Nature and Industry, these reactions occur by managing the proton and electron flow at the reaction center(s).  Therefore, the development and discovery of complexes capable of shuttling protons and electrons for small molecule activation is an area of great importance.  This NSF-funded project focused on a bioinspired approach to small molecule activation that incorporated redox-active centers and charge-responsive secondary coordination spheres into a single ligand scaffold for novel reactivity.  Specifically, numerous metal-ligand coordination complexes based on the pyridinediimine (PDI) ligand scaffold were developed and studied.  Similar to metalloenzyme active sites, these PDI ligands yielded complexes with acidic/basic sites and redox sites located in the same construct.  These complexes allowed us to learn about the fundamental nature of moving protons and electrons for the activation of small molecules and guided the development of novel design strategies to tune and control reduction potentials of ligand-based redox sites (in conjunction with the charge state of the secondary coordination sphere).
