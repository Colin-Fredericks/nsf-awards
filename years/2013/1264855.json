 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of surface heterogeneity can play a major role in particle adhesion to surfaces, even when both particle and surface are uniformly charged with the same sign of charge--which should make both surfaces strongly repulsive. The PI has previously demonstrated the magnitude of heterogeneity effect by using heterogeneous collecting surfaces to capture ?homogenous? particles with great specificity and efficiency. This proposal turns its focus on the dynamic consequences of heterogeneity (heterogeneity-driven fluctuations of flowing particles), when heterogeneity resides on the flowing particle rather than the collector. The proposed work will contribute to a broadening of sensing and separations technologies beyond reliance on the bio-molecular recognition paradigm to enable creation of separations and sensing systems that can withstand a broad range of operating conditions. The PI will demonstrate how the fundamental understanding derived from their studies can be translated to 3 specific applications: heterogeneous drug carriers in blood, on-line bacterial sensing, and a non-immuno-based whole-cell cancer diagnostic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examines mechanisms for the adhesion of flowing microparticles to stationary surfaces, a process that occurs in nature (the transport of bacteria in groundwater, the redistribution of sedimenting soils, the innate immune response of white cells in the blood); in industrial processes (polishing, coating); in medical and security technologies (diagnostics for disease, cancer therapeutics and drug delivery, sensors for harmful particulates, antimicrobial surfaces and surfaces of implants); and in every day life (the adhesion of dust particles to surfaces or those breathed in the lungs.)  The program focused on specific mechanisms for the interplay between surface forces arising from surface chemistry with hydrodynamics or mechanical forces.  Acting together, the interplay between these classes of forces produce new mechanisms by which particles interact with a stationary surfaces: arrest upon first contact, skipping or rolling along the surface, or flowing freely near the surface. \n\nThe outcomes of the project include 1) identification of a new mechanisms by which hydrodynamically-driven particle rotations shift the impact of heterogeneous chemical features on particle and collector surfaces (including a demonstrate of the range of chemical features and flow rates where the effect happens) 2) libraries of designer particles and surfaces with controlled heterogeneous surface features 3) specific engineering design maps guiding the density of adhesive chemistry to place on a surface, depending on whether the surface is the one that moves or the one that is fixed  4) translation of concepts for dielectric surfaces to the use of high performance materials including a demonstration for a large area single-sheet graphene collector 5) translation of fundamental concepts to the near-surface behaviors of flowing bacteria, demonstrating how hydrodynamics and mechanics affect the dynamic adhesion of methicillin resistant  S. aureus bacteria on biomedically-relevant coating materials.  6)  a demonstration of key classes non-adhesion bio-resistant hydrogel coatings where nanometrially-thin coatings behaved similar to layers which were 5 orders of magnitude thicker.  6)  a modeling method that combines the statistics for the distributions of heterogeneous surface features with a common theory of electrostatic interactions to predict interactions of flowing particles.\n\n \n\nThe significance of this work lies in its improvement of the understanding of how small particles stick to surfaces in a flow situation and the translation of the new principles to health- and technology-relevant materials.  The program also advanced human resources by providing training for one post doctoral fellow, 3 graduate students and 6 undergraduate students, both in the lab and in their network with other scientists from universities and industry and national meetings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maria M Santore"
