The work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of these procedures with a focus on nonlinear effects and explore potential applications in fields ranging from quantum information science to extreme low-light level engineering. \r\n\r\nQuantum optics and quantum information science appeals to both physics students and the general public. This work will attract and train talented students and postdocs in this active area of research. Particular effort is made to attract women and minorities to those fields. In addition, many of the effects studied in this work have the potential to impact future applications of quantum computing/simulation as well as nano-engineering.",
