 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates one of the most profound changes in human history - the world-wide surge of urbanization. According to a 2007 UN report, the world became more urban than rural in 2006, with more people living in cities than in the countryside. A more recent UN report estimates that the world urban population will increase by 72 percent by 2050, from 3.6 billion in 2011to 6.3 billion in 2050. This unprecedented global urbanization is profound in three ways. First, such an urban revolution signifies the deep reorganization of local and national politics and economy. It entails massive displacement of people and production, the shattering of existing social and economic networks, and the gradual formation of new governance schemes. Second, the rapid growth of cities relies on vociferous consumption of resources and produces increasing pollution. It, as a result, poses serious threats to the sustainability of human society. Third, such rapid urbanization would not have happened without equally fast globalization of the market. Cities now are much more inter-connected. \r\n\r\nYet urbanization is highly uneven across the globe. China, with its spectacular economic rise, is now the fastest urbanizing region and the world's largest construction site. How do Chinese cities contribute to global urbanization and in so doing shape the global movements of capital, resources and ideas? Moreover, most of China's urbanization occurs in the newly created towns. In the process, millions of farmers are displaced and an immense amount of resources is invested. However, many of the new towns remain 'ghost towns' or 'sleeping towns', where few people live and work during the day. How do these new (ghost) towns come into being? How should we understand China's rapid urban growth? Using the Hexi New Town in Nanjing in eastern China as a case study site, the research examines how different forces (domestic and foreign, social and material) collaborate or come into conflict with each other and collectively shape these new towns. It employs extensive archival research, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation. Theoretically, the research will integrate three strands of critical urban theory - urban political economy, urban political ecology, and ordinary urbanism. This project will not only provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of China's urbanization but also will create a dialogue between Western urban theory and the Chinese experience. The results of the research will be distributed in both academic and media venues in the West as well as in China. It will help local residents better understand the forces affecting their lives, especially civil groups whose interests are impacted by development. Moreover, the research will help ordinary observers outside of China, including those in the US, better assess the dramatic urban changes in China that influence their own lives from afar. Last, as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide the necessary support for a promising student to enrich her dissertation, complete her PhD Degree, and provide a solid foundation for her future research career.",

From 1980 to 2014, China&rsquo;s urban population increased by over 550 million (Figure 1). The rapid growth of Chinese cities is not only a dramatic implosion-explosion of society and economy within China but also profoundly reshapes the political economy and ecology of the planet. It is estimated that since 2009, China had produced more cement than the rest of the world combined (Figure 2). Ironically, since 2009, China&rsquo;s ghost towns came under the spotlight and ignited intense debates. How to make sense of China&rsquo;s remarkable urban &ldquo;growth&rdquo; or &ldquo;false prosperity&rdquo; in some cases? This dissertation provides insights into the issue by interrogating two crucial aspects of China&rsquo;s urban revolution. One is the urban planning practice, which is the official, &ldquo;technical&rdquo; reasoning of city leaders and planners on how to build the city. The other is the now hotly debated new town movement. Theoretically, the research attempts to&nbsp;engage in two prominent debates: the ever-renewing &ldquo;relational&rdquo; turn in urban studies, and the call for &ldquo;theories with Chinese characteristics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"p\">To tackle these empirical and theoretical questions, the dissertation, first of all, draws insights from three bodies of literature: 1) current studies of Chinese urban planning and new town development, 2) critical theories of urban planning, and 3) various relational approaches in urban studies, including urban political economy, urban policy mobility, urban political ecology and assemblage urbanism. Critically reviewing and integrating these studies, the dissertation constructs an integrative, relational &ldquo;cognitive map&rdquo; to comprehend urbanization in China, which views China&rsquo;s plan-making and new town development as the intersection of five groups of forces - the state, capitalist actors, specialists, ordinary citizens, and nature (Figure 3). Emphatically, the relational approach aims to grasp a &ldquo;time-geography&rdquo; of urbanization. In other words, it understands what happens at the locality at one moment as intricately connected with processes and power dynamics in the past and elsewhere. Furthermore, taking note of the caveat that a relational framework can flirt with or indulge a flat ontology and anarchistic epistemology, the dissertation not only aims to illustrate the &ldquo;relationality&rdquo; of the diverse forces involved in urban change but also seeks to capture the uneven power relations among them. Inspired by area studies on the Chinese state and Neil Brenner&rsquo;s state space theory, the dissertation highlights the dominating power of the Chinese state and its dynamic, porous coalition with capital and planning professionals to promote urban expansion.</p>\n<p class=\"p\">Using two case studies, one about the shifting planning practices in Nanjing since 1978, and the other on the birth and growth of Nanjing&rsquo;s Hexi New Town from 2001 to 2016 (Figure 4 and 5), the dissertation contributes to the study of Chinese cities and urban studies in general in following ways. Firstly, it provides an in-depth and rich historical review of the evolution of urban planning and new town development in China from 1949 to the present day at both national and local levels. Secondly, through extensive archival studies and interviews and an ethnographic analysis of the day-to-day operation of two state units in Nanjing, the dissertation reveals that the planning and transformation of Nanjing and Hexi are not only dynamic assembling processes of heterogeneous social-ecological relations but also a state-led project. Urban development is carried out to facilitate accumulation as well as to maintain and expand state legitimacy and realize the ambition of the local state and particular political leaders. Thirdly, the research argues that theories developed in the West should be applied in local contexts with caution. To construct &ldquo;theories with Chinese characteristics,&rdquo; scholars should conceptualize the present as deeply embedded in the locality and the nation&rsquo;s past. Chinese urban planning and urban expansion are distinctive primarily because of the unique interlocking of the party-state, market, society and nature, and the subsumptive force of the Chinese party-state (Figure 6). Among others, two crucial features of the unique institutional materiality are, firstly, the state ownership of urban land, and secondly, the still prevailing mentality of state-domination in the society that stems from China's socialist past.</p>\n<p class=\"p\">Moreover, doing the research is also a process of generating&nbsp;broader social impacts. First&nbsp;and foremost,&nbsp;it provides a platform for intellectual exchange,&nbsp;between western urban studies and Chinese urban studies, and between ordinary citizens and powerful decision-makers in Hexi and Nanjing. It promotes teaching and training of planning students in Nanjing University through multiple graduate seminars.&nbsp;At last, the research helps ordinary observers outside of China better grasp the Chinese urban drama, which influences&nbsp;their lives from afar - giving rise to a truly \"planetary\" urbanization. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
