 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some dinoflagellates (small unicellular marine organisms) are bioluminescent; they have the ability to emit flashes of light, a beautiful and spectacular sight in the ocean. This project will explore the potential role of voltage gated proton channel (HV) proteins in bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and test their physiological role in bioluminescence. The location of the channel proteins in scintillons (the light emitting organelles of these dinoflagellates) will be examined, as well as their biophysical properties as proton channels. This project explores a novel aspect of dinoflagellate biology and provides an excellent model in which to study the general mechanism of proton selective transport, which is an essential aspect of the processes of photosynthesis and respiration. \r\nBroader impact:  This project will generate knowledge of the basic biology of the dinoflagellates, some of which are responsible for toxic \"red tides\" whilst those that are bioluminescent create threats of exposure for night-time naval operations involving divers, swimmers and underwater vehicles. This project will provide a unique opportunity to train a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of molecular biology, biophysics and marine science.",
