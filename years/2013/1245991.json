 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS:  A Landscape on the Threshold of Change is supported by the Antarctic Integrated System Science (AISS) program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of the Division of Polar Programs within the Geosciences Directorate of the National Sciences Foundation (NSF).  The funds will support the collection of state-of-the-art high resolution LIDAR (combining the terms light and radar) imagery of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica in the 2014/2015 Antarctic field season, with LIDAR data collection and processing being provided by the NSF-supported NCALM (National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping) facility. LIDAR images collected in 2014/2015 will be compared to images from 2001 in order to detect decadal change. Additional fieldwork will look at the distribution of buried massive ice, and the impacts that major changes like slumping are having on the biota. All field data will be used to improve models on energy balance, and hydrology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  There have been dramatic changes over the past decade in the McMurdo Dry Valleys: glaciers are deflating by tens of meters, rivers are incising by more than three meters, and thermokarst slumps are appearing near several streams and lakes. These observations have all been made by researchers in the field, but none of the changes have been mapped on a valley-wide scale. This award will provide a new baseline map for the entire Dry Valley system, with high-resolution imagery provided for the valley floors, and lower resolution imagery available for the higher elevation areas that are undergoing less change.  The project will test the idea that sediment-covered ice is associated with the most dramatic changes, due to differential impacts of the increased solar radiation on sediment-covered compared to clean ice, and despite the current trend of slightly cooling air temperatures within the Dry Valleys. Information collected on the topography, coupled with the GPR determined buried ice distributions, will also be incorporated into improved energy and hydrological models. In addition to providing the new high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), the project will ultimately result in identification of areas that are susceptible to sediment-enhanced melt-driven change, providing a powerful prediction tool for the impacts of climate change.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The new DEM will be immediately useful to a wide range of disciplines, and will provide a comprehensive new baseline against which future changes will be compared. The project will provide a tool for the whole community to use, and the investigators will work with the community to make them aware of the new assets via public presentations, and perhaps via a workshop. The map will have international interest, and will also serve as a tool for environmental managers to draw on as they consider conservation plans.  Several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the project, and one of the co-PIs is a new investigator. The imagery collected is expected to be of interest to the general public in addition to scientific researchers, and venues for outreach such as museum exhibits and the internet will be explored. The proposed work is synergistic with 1) the co-located McMurdo LTER program, and 2) the NCALM facility that is also funded by the Geosciences Directorate.",

Glaciers have deflated, thermokarst slumps have formed near lakes and streams, and rivers have become incised. The goal of this project was to assess the biological consequences of these geomorphic changes. Specifically, we collected information on how landscape scale disturbance has impacted environmental factors in disturbance prone habitats, surveyed microbial communities in these prone habitats, and used experimental approaches to determine the response of communities to disturbances. Studies were conducted in three susceptible habitats; water tracks, streams, and the soil active layer. Water tracks are defined as areas of water-saturated soil in topographic lows which drain hillslopes in the absence of overland flow. In this study, we collected samples along transects that spanned three reaches of two water tracks in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Edaphic conditions found within water tracks were highly variable. This variability impacted the associated microbial communities, with some water track reaches harboring more abundant and diverse bacterial communities than off track soils, while other reaches were biologically depauperate. As landscape scale change occurs in the MDV and water tracks expand, the impact to associated soil communities will depend on a variety of factors including the water track flow rate, solute content, and the ability to support the accumulation of soil organic matter. Streams in the MDV are experiencing increases in flow, sediment transport, and nutrient addition as melting rates increase and thermokarst slumps form along stream edges. In this study, we surveyed stream biofilm communities across MDV streams and deployed nutrient diffusing substrates in several streams to determine how nutrient inputs impact community structure. The survey results suggested that MDV stream microbial communities are highly diverse, that localized conditions dictate the bacterial community composition, and that while streams in the MDV are hotspots of biodiversity in an otherwise depauperate landscape, controls on community structure are complex and site specific. Additionally, the experimental data suggested that nutrients have the potential to stimulate growth and alter community structure in glacial meltwater stream microbial mats, and the recent erosion of permafrost and accelerated glacial melt will likely impact resident biota in Antarctic streams. Permafrost underlies the soils in the MDV, with an overlying active soil layer that thaws during summer months. This active layer is expected to expand as temperatures increase, altering conditions for soil microbial communities. In this study, we surveyed the microbial communities along the soil profile in soil pits and conducted reciprocal transplant experiments where near surface soils were incubated at lower soil horizons, and vice versa. Samples from the surface sediments were approximately an order of magnitude more diverse than samples from the bottom of the active layer, and richness declined predictably with depth. Reciprocal transplants of soil did not appear to impact community diversity or composition, suggesting that changing the temperature regime alone for moderate durations had little impact on the soil bacterial communities, and that other factors are responsible for the impact of depth on community diversity and structure. Together these surveys and experiments suggest that this region harbors highly adapted endemic communities that are susceptible to changing conditions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/21/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Van Horn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
