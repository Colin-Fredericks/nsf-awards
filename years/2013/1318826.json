 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid technology scaling has fueled an unprecedented growth in the semiconductor\r\nindustry, transforming the face of modern society. Commodity systems have\r\nundergone a sea change from the uniprocessor era of past decades to the current\r\nmany-core era. With numerous on-chip processing cores, the communication fabric\r\nin many-core systems becomes a critical design component. Network-on-Chip (NoC)\r\narchitectures are widely regarded as the most promising design for the\r\ncommunication platform for many-core systems, primarily due to their\r\nscalability. Many-core systems such as Intel 80-core and Tilera have already\r\nused NoCs as the backbone of communication between their on-chip processors. To\r\nmaintain fault-free execution in these many-core systems, it is imperative to\r\nensure sustained lifetime in both NoCs and processing cores. This research\r\nembarks on boosting sustainability in NoC architectures through a proactive\r\ndesign paradigm.\r\n \r\n \r\nUsing a cross-layer collaborative venture, spanning from the device layer to the\r\narchitecture layer, this project establishes a transformative framework to\r\ndesign sustainable NoC architectures. Existing techniques for NoCs tackle the\r\nsustainability design challenge in a reactive way by triggering corrective\r\nmechanisms after a component failure. The investigators explore an orthogonal\r\nproactive strategy, recognizing the need for device level aging awareness during\r\nthe entire life span of an NoC. This project demonstrates that sustainability\r\ncan be improved in NoCs without sacrificing power-performance, by considering\r\nthe criticality of packet transmission. By playing a central role to facilitate\r\nlong term sustainability in NoCs, this research can substantially improve the\r\ncost efficiency in building large data centers supporting our modern compute\r\nintensive society. Major research insights will be disseminated through teaching\r\nto develop relevant skill sets, lead to more sustainable future computer\r\nsystems, and benefit the community at large.",
