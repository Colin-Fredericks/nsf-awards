 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future heterogeneous multicore microprocessors are expected to be so\r\npower constrained that not all transistors will be able to be powered\r\non at once.  The general-purpose cores will be required to nimbly\r\nadapt to severely constrained power allocations when power is diverted\r\nto accelerators, and vice versa.  In addition, energy-aware scheduling\r\nof threads to cores is becoming imperative as multicore architectures\r\nbecome more heterogeneous.  This research develops power gated\r\nmulticore architectures and integrated scheduling and power allocation\r\nalgorithms for maximizing throughput given varying and potentially\r\nstringent limits on allocated power.\r\n\r\nOne facet of the research is the design, synthesis, and evaluation of\r\npower gated general-purpose and data-parallel accelerator\r\nmicroarchitectures comprised of deconfigurable lanes--horizontal\r\nslices through the pipeline--that permit dynamic tailoring of each\r\ncore to the application.  The goal is to demonstrate tolerable\r\nperformance and power-gating overheads yet flexibility in adapting to\r\nworkload behaviors.  A second aspect of the work is a new optimization\r\napproach that efficiently finds a near-global-optimum configuration of\r\nlanes and thread-to-core assignment without requiring offline training\r\nor foreknowledge of the workload.  The approach combines reduced\r\nsampling techniques, adaptation of response surface models to online\r\noptimization, incorporation of limited online profiling information,\r\nand heuristic online search.  The research will improve the\r\ncomputational capability of future severely power-constrained devices;\r\ninvolve undergraduate, graduate, and/or postdoc women engineers; and\r\nbe incorporated into computer architecture and heuristic optimization\r\nclasses.",
