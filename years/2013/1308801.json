 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor John L. Ferry at the University South Carolina at Columbia. There have been several important works describing the oxidation of dilute (nanomolar) Fe(II) by oxygen and many describing electron transfer from ferrous/ferric solids in anoxic solutions. However, these have not been integrated into a predictive, Fe-based continuous model for estimating ROS production. In the natural environment, Fe(III) can be reduced to the Fe(II) state through photochemical processes, direct reaction with reductants (e.g. sulfides) or via microbially mediated reduction. The net cycling between the two oxidation states leads to the apparent catalytic production of ROS (which include hydroperoxyl radical and its conjugate base superoxide, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide) and provides kinetically and energetically facile connections between the elemental Fe, O, C, S and N cycles. The researchers have developed a high throughput, combinatorial approach to explore the effect of solution variation on Fe(II) oxidation and ROS yield in the presence of Fe(III). Work proposed will test the specific hypothesis that ROS production is maximized when resulting Fe(III) is sequestered in phases that can undergo atom transfer as well as electron transfer with reactants in the solution phase. ROS will be measured in the aqueous phase through the addition of a series of organic probes. The concentration of dissolved metals will be determined by a combination of spectrophotometric and mass spectrometric techniques. Solids will be characterized for 56Fe to 58Fe to O ratios using electron backscatter and mass spectrometric techniques. The exchange of isotopically labeled Fe(II) with particulate Fe will be determined using high resolution mass spectrometric techniques. These observables will be correlated to the conditional initiating matrix to develop response surfaces describing the systemic ROS generation response to oxygen addition.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this study will result in a new understanding of how rapid Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycling is affected by co-solutes and colloids. These outcomes have significance to the general public in the context of carbon turnover driven by the by-product ROS (and hence climate change) as well as public health concerns. Results from this work will be incorporated into workshops designed to educate students and faculty outside of the field. The workshops will be developed in collaboration with the Hanse Institute for Advanced Study in Delmenhorst; Germany, and extended to the South Carolina State Museum. The proposed work will provide support for two graduate and two undergraduate students. Professors John Ferry and Tim Shaw have a well-documented record of mentoring underrepresented minorities and female students; 34 out of the 60 researchers in their laboratories have been female, and nine have been from underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of how reduced iron species oxidize in aqueous solutions that are exposed to air.  We specifically tested the hypothesis that this process would result in the formation of significant quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical.  Our work focused on how the yield of these ROS would change when reduced iron was oxidized in solution vs when it was oxidized in suspensions of iron oxide particles.\n\nThe concentrations of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were measured as a function of time during the oxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of various co-solutes and suspended solids.  It was determined that Fe(II) oxidation rate, when controlling for the presence of precipitating ligands, was not affected by suspensions of 0.01 wt% to 1.00 wt%  ferrihydrite, goethite, magnetite, lepidocrite and hydrous ferric oxides.  The steady state concentration of superoxide did not correlate with the presence of loading of particles, indicating the primary initiation step of Fe(II) oxidation occurred in solution.  Hydrogen peroxide was produced very rapidly (seconds).  It then decayed over the remainder of the observed reaction (hours).  Hydrogen peroxide maxima did not correlate with the presence of surfaces but the decay rate did, indicating that surfaces decomposed hydrogen peroxide.  Hydroxyl radical was measured indirectly through the application of a trapping reagent, terephthalic acid.  Hydroxyl radical yields did not correlate with surfaces, indicating that hydroxyl radical formation occurred in solution while surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition did not produce hydroxyl radicals.  Prolonged ROS formation could be achieved by the addition of hydrogen sulfide to particle suspensions, presumably through the catalytic sulfur-iron-oxygen cycle.\n\nThe most significant results have been a rank ordering for measuring the impact of particle type vs ROS production and testing this order against natural samples (a series of sediment samples from the SC marine littoral zone).  The most significant outcome was the discovery that the ferrihydrite phase in these minerals, in conjunction with reductants like hydrogen sulfide, promotes ROS formation in aphotic environments to a level similar to that observed from photochemical processes in the photic zone of the water column.
