The project is guided by an advisory group consisting of a broad range of experts in mathematics, mathematics research and mathematics practice.  The project is creating a tool that will allow state leaders to evaluate the quality of their implementation plans based on research and promising practices.  State teams have access to the experts and CCSSO personnel following the national meeting as the teams refine their implementation plans.",
