In recognition of this sustained interest, this award will support a workshop to identify high priority sedimentary targets for scientific drilling to address key questions on Earth system topics.  The primary goal of this workshop will be to galvanize research teams to plan and begin to execute proposals for pursuing specific, high priority drilling targets, intended to address key science questions related to paleoclimate, paleobiology, and extreme events in Earth?s history.",
