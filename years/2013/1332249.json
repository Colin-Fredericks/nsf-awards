 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall research objective of this project is to create assembly- and origami-based techniques for the generation of fully three-dimensional living tissues that are structured like natural tissues and include effective vascular networks. To accomplish this goal, the research first uses two-dimensional directed assembly to selectively locate multiple cell types in their proper locations on two-dimensional scaffold structures. The scaffolds are then origami-folded to convert the two-dimensional cell assemblies into three-dimensional structures that replicate the structure of natural tissues. This research addresses the three limitations to tissue engineering -  tissue quality, tissue quantity, and speed of production - that have stood in the way of generating tissues for medical therapies. The project will also create new K-12 teacher training materials on origami in mathematics; involve high school students and teachers directly in the research; enable research opportunities for undergraduates from a diversity of backgrounds; and engage with high school students and the public through museum and high school level mathematics outreach. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project offers the potential to save lives through the creation of tissues rapidly and efficiently with an extremely high level of control over tissue structure. At present, the limited supply of donor organs leads to thousands of deaths every year. The improved engineering of human tissues has the potential to save lives directly, through the provision of transplants to supplement the supply of donor organs, as well as indirectly, by creating tissues for the screening of new medical therapies before human testing takes place. From an educational and societal perspective, the benefits include enhancement of grade school and high school mathematics education through wide distribution of teacher training materials; increased opportunities for public engagement with origami mathematics through museum exhibits; and broadened research engagement of high school students, undergraduates, and teachers, with a particular emphasis on those from underrepresented minority backgrounds or who serve predominantly underrepresented minority communities. \r\n\r\nThis research project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.",
