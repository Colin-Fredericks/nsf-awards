Plasma production in liquid water produces a host of oxidation agents capable of rapidly decomposing organic contaminants.  The proposed effort investigates a novel method of producing plasma in bubbles immersed in water by driving them at resonance in the presence of an electric field.  This effort studies the ignition physics of resonantly driven bubbles, the time evolution of plasma formation in such bubbles, and the chemistry of the active interfacial layer separating the plasma bubble and the liquid water.  The understanding gained from these studies will be used to design and build a plasma reactor for the purpose of water purification.  Laboratory tours and demonstrations will be given to students from the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program and those sponsored by Women in Science and Engineering, using in-house fabricated plasma demonstration experiments.  The proposed effort will sponsor a student from the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), a program aimed at encouraging underrepresented students to attend graduate school.  The plasma demonstrations will be integrated into the existing educational outreach effort led by the National Society of Black Engineers.",
