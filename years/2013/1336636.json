 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Marsh, E. Neil\r\nProposal Number: 1336636\r\nInstitution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor\r\nTitle: SusChEM: Biomolecular and cellular engineering for hydrocarbon biofuel production\r\n\r\nThe proposal will develop a new biological route for efficient production of advanced ?drop-in? hydrocarbon fuels from renewable resources, by integrating enzyme, metabolic pathway and cellular engineering. Today ethanol and biodiesel are the only biofuels produced and utilized at a large scale. However, each has severe drawbacks due to incompatibility with current infrastructures and/or very limited supply of suitable feedstocks. Therefore, there is both a pressing need and increasing scope for developing a new generation of biofuels.\r\n\r\nTarget of this project is to produce short- and medium-chain alkanes and alkenes (C8-C20) derived from fatty acids, which can be used as direct substitute of petroleum based fuels. To enable the production of these advanced biofuels using recombinant E. coli strains, the PI will investigate and optimize hydrocarbon-producing enzymes, fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, and whole-cell machinery, via (1) Mechanistic studies and engineering of key enzymes in two hydrocarbon-producing pathways, (2) Metabolic pathway engineering for increasing fatty acids as hydrocarbon precursors, and (3) Pathway integration and cellular engineering for hydrocarbon production from cellulosic biomass.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this project will lead to several potentially transformative outcomes. First, this project will develop an innovative strategy across multiple scales for creating efficient whole-cell biocatalysts. Second, the PIs will generate E. coli strains capable of producing high-grade hydrocarbon biofuels from renewable resources. Third, the PIs will advance fundamental understanding of mechanisms of hydrocarbon-producing enzymes, regulation of fatty acids synthesis, and whole-cell metabolism. The genome engineering and ultrahigh-throughput screening approach represents a major innovation in microbial engineering and its variation/extension can be employed for improving a wide variety of complex phenotypes. More generally, the scientific knowledge generated through these activities will prove valuable for other bio-engineering applications.\r\n\r\nThe scientific findings resulted from this project will make significant contributions to the ultimate development of cost-effective and sustainable production of hydrocarbon biofuels, which helps solve one of the most pressing challenges currently faced by our society. The education and outreach activities will focus on fostering academic and professional development of involved graduate student and postdoc, supporting undergraduate research, and promoting underrepresented groups. Expanding previous and ongoing activities, the PIs also plan to engage middle/high school students in summer research within a team setting with undergraduates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing genetically engineered microorganisms to produce chemical feedstocks and fuels represents an environmentally friendly alternative to producing them from oil and gas, as is currently the case.  This requires both designing new biochemical pathways that allows chemicals of interest to be produced from common cellular metabolites and then engineering new enzymes into a suitable microbe, which are required to convert the metabolites into useful chemicals.  In this project we have focused on the biochemical production of styrene, which is an important chemical feedstock used in the production of plastics such as polystyrene.\n\n \n\nSome microbes such as yeast will naturally produce styrene and related chemicals when growing in the presence of various food preservatives such as cinnamic acid, which is the principal flavoring component of cinnamon.  The yeast converts cinnamic acid to styrene through the action of a decarboxylase enzyme.  Decarboxylases are an important class of enzymes that remove carbon dioxide from organic molecules, such as cinnamic acid, that contain a carboxylic acid group. \n\n \n\nPrevious studies examining how yeast convert cinnamic acid to styrene suggested that two particular enzymes might be involved, but the literature was confused as to why two enzymes would be needed.  We isolated and purified both enzymes and showed that, in fact, only one enzyme catalyzed the decarboxylation reaction.  We found that the other enzyme, instead, made a cofactor needed by decarboxylase to catalyze the decarboxylation reaction.  Cofactors are typically small organic molecules - are bound by enzymes and allow them to catalyze chemical reactions that would otherwise be very hard to perform.  In this case the cofactor turned out to be a completely new organic molecule termed a prenyl-flavin, which is a derivative of riboflavin, or vitamin B2.\n\n \n\nWe have studied how the decarboxylase enzyme uses prenyl-flavin to convert cinnamic acid to styrene and carbon dioxide.  It appears that chemical mechanism is completely different to any other enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation reaction.  In the process, we have shown that the enzyme will decarboxylate a wide range of chemically modified versions of cinnamic acid that results in new types of styrene-like molecules that may find uses as high value specialty chemicals. \n\n \n\nWe also showed that the prenyl-flavin synthesizing enzyme is present in other microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria, where this cofactor is likely important in ubiquinone biosynthesis.  Since ubiquinone is vital to the ability of many bacteria to grow, these findings could lead to the development of new types of antibiotics.\n\n \n\nBuilding on our increased understanding of the two enzymes described above, we also initiated efforts in incorporating the biosynthesis pathway into industrially relevant microbial chassis systems.
