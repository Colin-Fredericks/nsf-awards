 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Cornell University funds a workshop to be hosted by The Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC). The CASC community is the primary provider of advanced computing for the nation's academic researchers who require access to both high-end computing resources and expertise. Participants are leaders in advanced computing infrastructure at campus, regional, and national levels. Units that provide campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) face the challenges and opportunities of a dynamic technical frontier that must facilitate collaborations and operations at local, national, and international levels. At the same time, campus CI face common challenges regarding implementing viable and sustainable economic models. Within this dynamic and challenging environment, this workshop offers a rare opportunity to engage leaders from academia, industry, and funding agencies to share and contrast emerging CI challenges, opportunities, and solutions. Campus CI, while unique to an academic institution and reflective of different institutional priorities, often share common operating models, technical challenges, and financial realities. This workshop offers an innovative and agile leadership group the opportunity to anticipate, compare and contrast various approaches to common CI challenges and opportunities, both technical and economic. Topics of discussion include shifting research and education drivers and their infrastructure requirements; the role of state and federal agencies in CI funding; high-tech workforce and staff development; and, planning for a productive and efficient future at all levels of CI in the midst of growing infrastructure requirements, disruptive technologies, and increased competition for funding. \r\n\r\nCampus cyberinfrastructure, while unique to an academic institution and reflective of different institutional priorities, often share common operating models, technical challenges, and economic realities. Cyberinfrastructure includes not only computing and data storage resources but also scientific instruments such as telescopes, gene sequencers, and distributed sensor networks. This workshop offers an innovative and agile group of U.S. cyberinfrastructure leaders an opportunity to anticipate, compare and contrast various approaches to the common challenges and opportunities in providing cyberinfrastructure services and resources, both technical and economic.",
