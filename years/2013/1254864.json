 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project investigates the structure-property relationship of extremely tough biological composites through a combined computational/experimental methodology. It will particularly focus on the synergetic role of geometry and length scales by investigating specific features such as hierarchy, periodicity and patterning in the microstructure and interfaces observed in some extraordinarily strong natural materials.  The research approach consists of: i) exploring, identifying and quantifying the contributions of the individual multiscale deformation mechanisms of the natural composites using a multiscale computational approach aided by specially designed experiments, ii) a biomimetic effort following a combined computational and prototype modeling approach that employs advanced 3D printing techniques, and iii) developing design guidelines, validated later by constructing materials that incorporate the most important microstructural features identified in (i) and (ii). Achieving these insights will uncover design rules to develop impact and damage tolerant materials.  \r\n\r\nThere is a strong demand for new paradigms of design and development of advanced high-performance structural materials with high strength and durability, low in cost and renewable with novel combinations of properties and qualities. We will study biological composite materials that can achieve high toughness without sacrificing stiffness and strength by control of nano- and microstructural features that significantly improve the mechanical performance of otherwise brittle materials. Additionally, this research will provide the rational mechanics framework for the development of high-performance and multifunctional materials for a wide range of technologically relevant applications in the areas of energy, defense, homeland security, civil, industrial safety, medicine and automotive industry. The educational component is closely integrated with the research, to inspire and attract students to the STEM field by its multidisciplinary nature. Undergraduate and graduate students will be mentored in an interdisciplinary setting. Additionally, the integration between research and education will improve engineering undergraduate and graduate education by including components of biology in material related courses through the infusion of cyberlearning tools and hands-on experience. The PI will introduce a new multidisciplinary course entitled \"Materials and structures inspired by Nature for infrastructure applications and beyond\" with special guest lecturers from Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Materials Science and other engineering disciplines.",

As such, one of the current challenges in materials engineering is the design of novel architected materials that can offer better trade-offs in terms of mechanical performance. The field of bioinspired architected materials has been gaining popularity in the last few years by providing evidence that geometrical control of material placement, enabled by advanced manufacturing techniques, can indeed lead to improved properties, and in some cases, to novel properties not attained before with conventional methods. On the other hand, we know that some key naturally-occurring materials have extraordinary mechanical properties and are highly efficient at providing protection and other functionalities, while using only the minimum amount of mechanically modest materials that are available in the environment. There is a plethora of aspects that make these materials ideal source of inspiration for the design of new engineering materials (e.g., self-assembly, conditions at which synthesis takes place, multi-functionality, hierarchical structure, fluid transport, self-healing, extreme mechanical properties, etc.). A closer look to their inner structures reveals complexity and architecture.
