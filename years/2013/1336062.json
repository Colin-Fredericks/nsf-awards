In recent years, treated wastewater effluent has been identified as a pathway for endocrine active compounds, including hormones and pharmaceuticals, to enter aquatic ecosystem with adverse effects for the health of exposed fish populations.  Despite these dramatic alterations to pre-industrial conditions, effluent dominated systems sustain many fish species and are used by the human population for recreation.  Updates to the wastewater infrastructure supplying these urban aquatic ecosystems cannot accomplish restoration to pristine condition, and instead need to strive for the greatest cost-benefit of the infrastructure investment. This project explores the idea that large-scale wastewater infrastructure improvements will reduce overall endocrine active compound concentrations in an effluent dominated urban aquatic ecosystem and, thus, will enhance the sustainability of fish populations despite continued presence and inputs of these compounds. A case study will examine the efficacy of upgrading two major wastewater treatment plants in the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area to disinfection (Ultraviolet (UV); chlorination/dechlorination).  This aquatic ecosystem has been the focus of intense biological and chemical study for several years and provides a unique opportunity to assess (i) how two approaches to effluent disinfection will reduce endocrine active compound loads in the final effluent; (ii) how estrogenicity, a measure of the total biological activity in the system, is affected by the upgrades to two treatment plants contributing roughly 50% of all effluent in the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area; (iii) how the two treatment technologies (UV vs. chlorination/dechlorination) compare in their efficacy of removing endocrine active compounds from the final treated effluent; and (iv) how adverse biological effects in exposed fish will be mitigated. \r\n\r\nThis project will address an understudied area in the environmental sciences that has a direct impact on the majority of our population, which resides in urban areas with effluent dominated ecosystems.  The ability to study the effects of two disinfection technologies side-by-side in two size-matched urban wastewater treatment plants will provide efficacy information to wastewater treatment plant engineers and will help guide investment into future infrastructure upgrades.  Urban ecosystems will benefit from a better understanding of how technology can help to reduce the environmental loads of endocrine active compounds and provide for sustainable fish populations.",

These may include pharmaceuticals, personal care products and hormones. Previous studies have demonstrated that these substances can interfere with normal organismal function and may threaten the sustainability of aquatic wildlife. Updates to the wastewater infrastructure supplying these urban aquatic ecosystems cannot accomplish restoration to pristine condition, and instead strive for the greatest cost-benefit of the infrastructure investment. However, little is known about how improvements to wastewater treatment, such as implementation of disinfection, may reduce these endocrine-active chemicals and improve urban aquatic ecosystems.</p>\n<p>To address this knowledge gap, our three universities collaborated and partnered with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. We studied how disinfection upgrades to two major (1 billion liters/day design load) wastewater treatment plants may alter the discharge of endocrine-active chemicals and effects on the wildlife in receiving waters.&nbsp; Specifically, we determined the reduction in endocrine-active chemicals as a result of either disinfection through UV or chlorination, two commonly used wastewater disinfection techniques.&nbsp; Measurements of endocrine-active chemicals in effluent prior and after disinfection were paired with focused benchtop experiments to further determine the effectiveness of each disinfection method.&nbsp; To understand the changes in total biological activity of the effluent before and after disinfection, we also used cell-based bioassays (a time- and cost-effective, novel way to screen effluents for 70 types of toxicity) and on-site fish exposures under controlled conditions. Lastly, we surveyed resident sunfish populations in the receiving rivers to assess whether the implementation of disinfection methods improved fish health in this urban aquatic ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We found that the treated wastewater effluent without disinfection contained many hormones and prescription pharmaceuticals at concentrations that cause biological changes in human cells and fish in receiving waters. These changes included alteration in gene expression, especially to pathways associated with detoxification, metabolism, stress and reproductive hormone (estrogenic) signaling, misdirection of energy in male fish, and changes to liver structure in male and female fish. &nbsp;UV disinfection of wastewater effluent reduced pharmaceutical and hormone concentrations by up to 68%, but did not eliminate these chemicals from wastewater. Similarly, disinfection by chlorination reduced the presence of these chemicals by up to 71% without fully removing them from the wastewater. These measurements of endocrine-active compounds in wastewater were validated through benchtop experiments in the laboratory with wastewater &ldquo;spiked&rdquo; with the same endocrine-active compounds.&nbsp; We found a good match between compounds observed to decrease in wastewater effluent and those determined to be transformed in laboratory. Cell and gene assays show that disinfection did not substantially remove variety of toxicities, indicating that disinfection might have resulted in formation of new chemicals (degradation products of hormones and pharmaceuticals) that can also be biologically-active. When we exposed fish in controlled laboratory trailers (see photograph) on-site to wastewater effluent prior and following disinfection we found subtle differences between the two disinfection methods.&nbsp; Both treatment technologies reduced the induction of a protein associated with feminization in male fish thus reducing misdirection of limited energetic resources. UV disinfection also reduced adverse biological responses in fish after seven days of effluent exposure while disinfection by chlorination did not reduce adverse biological responses to the same degree or at all.&nbsp; This finding was matched by those from the cell-based bioassays as endocrine activity of disinfected wastewater did not diminish appreciatively through disinfection using either method.&nbsp; Surveys of sunfish residing or being placed in cages in wastewater effluent receiving streams found few reductions in adverse biological responses likely due to the short post-infrastructure upgrade monitoring period. These results, when taken together, suggest that disinfection of wastewater effluent has the potential to reduce some endocrine-active compounds in wastewater and maintain or improve some aspects of fish health in receiving lakes, rivers and streams, but that further treatment improvements may be even more beneficial (e.g., amendment of UV treatment with advanced oxidation processes). It appears that UV disinfection is superior to chlorination in reducing the impact of endocrine-active compounds on fish populations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project involved the participation of many undergraduate and graduate students, and visiting faculty at the three collaborating universities.&nbsp; A special effort was made to provide interdisciplinary experiences to the undergraduate students to give them a greater appreciation of the integrative and complex nature of the science.
