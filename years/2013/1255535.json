 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR),  Professor Jeffrey Anker and his group at Clemson University are developing a novel, powerful, and general method, known as functional X-ray Luminescence Tomography (fXLT), for high-resolution chemical imaging in tissues. The proposed technique combines the advantages of X-ray imaging, including its excellent spatial resolution and ability to image deep in tissue, with the chemical sensitivity of optical methods. The proposed approaches are to 1) construct a proof-of-principle high-resolution fXLT instrument and evaluate signal strength and X-ray doses in model tissue samples, 2) develop and characterize chemical sensing films and particles and evaluate chemical sensitivity, and 3) evaluate the spatial resolution and chemical sensitivity of fXLT films embedded in intralipid/hemoglobin tissue-mimics and ex vivo porcine tissue. \r\n\r\nThe proposed imaging technology has the potential to revolutionize biological and biomedical imaging by providing a powerful, general set of minimally invasive imaging methods for detecting chemical changes with high spatial resolution on surfaces deep within tissue.  Professor Anker also plans to provide valuable training for graduate and undergraduate students who will gain expertise in experimental design, nanoparticle synthesis and characterization, microscopy, spectroscopy, chemical analysis, particle printing, data analysis, and dissemination via manuscripts and oral presentations. Research methods and results will be included in a new graduate class on imaging, sensing, and therapy with nanoparticles. The PI will also incorporate fXLT spectroscopy examples into his undergraduate Quantitative and Instrumental Analysis courses. A high school teacher will collaborate on inkjet printer research and outreach project through a research experience for teachers (RET) summer research plan. High school students will participate in the research activities through an exciting chemical-sensing robot kit competition.",
