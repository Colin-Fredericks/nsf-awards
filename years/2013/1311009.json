The project title is Fabrication of Light Activated Micro-grippers for Cellular Robots. The host scientist is Dr. JinSeok Kim.\r\nThis project develops tweezer-like microscale grippers (~15\u00ecm) composed of photoresponsive materials using a light fabrication technique similar to the one used to develop computer chips. The grippers are being attached onto the fresh-water microorganism, Tetrahymena pyriformis, using magnetic and chemical adhesion. These inorganic attached grippers will be opened and closed with various colors of light. The combined microbe and gripper are controlled as a single microbiorobot with potential uses in biomedical applications and microassembly. The developed platform is anticipated to serve as a prototype for microrobots functionalized with some inorganic actuator.\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this academic and cultural experience will be promoted and shared through mentoring via various organizations, programs, and symposiums.",
