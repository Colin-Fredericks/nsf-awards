 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The proposed project is to the 8th International Workshop on Bulk Nitride Semiconductors to be held in Bavaria, Germany, Sept.30 - Oct.5, 2013. The requested support of $10,000 is will be used to provide travel and accommodation support or in the form of registration fees for up to 10 participants in the conference.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThis Workshop will bring together researchers focused on developing growth technologies and applying these technologies to grow bulk nitride materials and device structures for electronic, optoelectronic and photonic applications. Leading experts will present recent accomplishments in the field of bulk nitride growth, properties and their application in electronics and optoelectronics. The specific goal of the workshop is to identify critical challenges remaining in these fields and to facilitate establishing international collaborations to jointly work on their solutions. This meeting offers a unique opportunity for the community to share the exciting state-of-the-art technological developments, stimulate new ideas, learn new challenges and directions, and explore/promote new collaborations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe meeting aims to bring together international researchers from academia, government and industry to present and assess the current state-of-the-art of growth of bulk nitride materials and device structures for electronic, optoelectronic and photonic applications. The meeting will help to advance the field through sharing of results, methods, inspiring of new ideas, and initiation of new collaborations. Participation of women scientists and young researchers in engineering will be fostered based on NSF funds to partially cover travel expenses and registration fees.",
