 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds work done by the Stanford High Energy Theory Group.  The faculty personnel on this award are Professors Savas Dimopoulos, Renata Kallosh, Shamit Kachru, Andrei Linde, Stephen Shenker, Eva Silverstein and Leonard Susskind.    \r\n\r\nUnder this award, this group will engage in a broad program of research at the leading edge of theoretical physics.  Dimopoulos will pursue the correct theoretical interpretation of data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN as it sharpens over the next years. He will also continue his focus on astrophysical probes of dark matter and on novel methods of detecting gravitational waves.  Kallosh, Linde and Silverstein will work at the interface of inflation with fundamental theory, including the embedding of new classes of models into supergravity and string theory.  Furthermore, Linde, Shenker and Susskind will continue their studies of the mysteries of eternal inflation, while Silverstein's program of research will tie these pieces to an interlinked, concrete program of studying field theory in time-dependent backgrounds.  Kachru and Silverstein propose to use holography in Anti de Sitter (AdS) space to understand novel phases of quantum field theory at finite density, and Kachru is pursuing a complementary program of research on pure field theory questions with possible applications to condensed matter systems.  Shenker proposes a program of research to unearth further lessons from new dualities involving higher-spin theories of gravity, while Kachru, Shenker and Susskind will pursue recent advances in the theory of black holes.\r\n\r\nThe PI's also have a consistent history of pursuing the broader impacts of their research, and will continue to do so during the period of this award.   They will devote substantial energy toward the training of graduate students and postdocs, who represent the future of this field.  They will also continue their efforts to reach the broader public.  In the past these broader impacts have taken the form of appearances in popular television shows, public lectures, participation in events such as the World Science Festival, authorship of popular books and magazine articles, organizational work that benefits the field as a whole, and interdisciplinary teaching. These activities will continue at a high level during this award.",

These were aimed at designing new experiments to probe fundamental physics; understanding the physics of the very early Universe, which holds key answers that underlie today?s distribution of matter and energy; and exploring new the- oretical and mathematical frameworks that may allow physicists to write down unified theories of gravity and quantum mechanics. \n\n1 Particle Physics \n\nIn many modern theories, the masses and interactions of the elementary particles with one another are determined by the values of a background field (somewhat analogous to a background electric or magnetic field). The mass of the electron, as well as the strength of the electric field that its charge generates, is affected by the value of this background field in combination with the Higgs field. In such theories, if the dark matter that constitutes 25% of the energy in today?s Universe is itself comprised of this background field, fundamental observables like the electron mass will vary in regions of the Universe with different dark matter density. \n\nProfessor Dimopoulos proposed new experiments to detect such hypothetical variation of the electron mass, using resonant-mass antennas. Such an experi- ment, if successful, would be a large step forward toward explaining the makeup and origin of dark matter. \n\n2 Cosmology \n\nMany features of our present Universe, such as its enormous size and relative homogeneity (on scales large compared to a single galaxy), are mysteries that require unusual initial distributions of matter and energy in the very early Uni- verse. Modern cosmology theory posits that these initial distributions can be quantitatively explained by inflationary theories with just a few measurable parameters. \n\nProfessors Kallosh and Linde discovered new classes of such inflationary theories, called &alpha;-attractors, where the properties of the inflationary observables match well with present data. These theories make interesting predictions for future experiments. \n\n3 String Theory \n\nThe tension between quantum mechanics and Einstein?s theory of gravity (gen- eral relativity) remains a central theme of research in modern theoretical physics.  String theories, where elementary particles are secretly tiny loops of string, pro- vide one promising approach to this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kachru?s work during this period is aimed at understanding new mathematical structures underlying string theory, in somewhat the same way that theories of curved space underlie Einstein?s theory of gravity. \n\nProfessor Silverstein discovered interesting and realistic new models of in- flationary cosmology that arise naturally in string theory, with concomitant implications for future experiment. \n\nThe future experiments informed by the work of Professors Kallosh, Linde, and Silverstein include searches for primordial gravity waves, which physicists hope will be observed relatively soon. \n\n4 Quantum Gravity \n\nA major theme of research in quantum gravity involves the quantum properties of black holes.
