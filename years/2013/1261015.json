 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Research Experiences for Students program trains twelve students to conduct research on climate change in Australia, in collaboration with the CSIRO Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre in the Northern Territory of Australia. Undergraduate and graduate students are conducting climate change research under the mentorship of CSIRO scientists.\r\n\r\nThe investigations conducted by the CSUDH-CSIRO collaboration use the living laboratory of the Northern Territory to test hypotheses on the relationships among fire frequency, fire intensity, climate change, and biodiversity. Investigations are evaluating how management regimes affect rates of carbon sequestration, changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Projects may be conducted at multiple sites throughout the Northern Territory, including the Kimberley, Tiwi Islands, western Arnhem land, and in the Darwin region, including the Territory Wildlife Park.\r\nThis project provides long-term immersive research experiences in an international setting that are designed to recruited talented students into graduate study emphasizing climate science, and commence the interest and ability to maintain and develop international collaborations. Most students will be members of groups underrepresented in the sciences, reflecting the student population at CSUDH.",
