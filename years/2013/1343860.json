 "awd_abstract_narration": "As pervasive sensors continuously collect and record massive amounts of\r\nhigh-dimensional data from communication, social, and biological networks,\r\nand growing storage as well as processing capacities of modern computers\r\nhave provided new and powerful ways to dig into such huge quantities of\r\ninformation, the need for novel analytic tools to comb through these \"big\r\ndata\" becomes imperative. The objective of this project is to develop a\r\nnovel framework for nonlinear, data-adaptive (de)compression algorithms to\r\nlearn the latent structure within large-scale, incomplete or corrupted\r\ndatasets for compressing and storing only the essential information, for\r\nrunning analytics in real time, inferring missing pieces of a dataset, and\r\nfor reconstructing the original data from their compressed renditions. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in the exploration of the fertile but largely\r\nunexplored areas of manifold learning, nonlinear dimensionality reduction,\r\nand sparsity-aware techniques for compression and recovery of missing and\r\ncompromised measurements. Capitalizing on recent advances in machine\r\nlearning and signal processing, differential geometry, sparsity, and\r\ndictionary learning are envisioned as key enablers. Effort will be put also\r\ninto developing online and distributed (non)linear dimensionality reduction\r\nalgorithms to allow for streaming analytics of sequential measurements\r\nusing parallel processors. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact is to contribute to the development of novel \r\ncomputational methods and tools useful for data inference, cleansing, \r\nforecasting, and collaborative filtering, with direct impact to \r\nstatistical signal processing and machine learning applications\r\nto large-scale data analysis, including communication, social, and\r\nbiological networks.",
