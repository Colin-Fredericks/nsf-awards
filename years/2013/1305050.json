LS-SCAMP is made up of South Carolina State University in collaboration with six Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), five technical colleges and three research institutions in South Carolina. The projects goals are to intensify recruitment initiatives to increase STEM enrollment by 30%, to increase and sustain the STEM baccalaureate degree production by 12% above the Phase I attainment (500 baseline to 800 degree attainment over 5 years), increase the number of LS-SCAMP students who enter graduate school within two years of graduating by 50 percent, develop two summer bridge programs (one academic and one research) for the successful transition of thirty technical college students into STEM baccalaureate degree programs in year one and 150 students over five years and increase the number of students that participate in academic and summer research activities.",
