 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This project considers both theoretical and practical aspects of\r\nresponse, control, and status of the University of Hawai`i Manoa (UHM) campus\r\nelectrical microgrid and studies its behavior when distributed renewable energy sources\r\nare added. This project will transform the UHM campus's electrical distribution network\r\ninto a more modern, intelligent and responsive microgrid which relies on a greater share\r\nof locally generated energy and energy efficient practices. Three interlinked research\r\nprojects will be integrated into the education program on smart grids, renewable energy,\r\nand energy efficiency. The first component assembles all relevant information about the\r\nstate of the microgrid and surrounding environment. A second component models and\r\nanalyzes the microgrid using probabilistic signal processing and networking models to\r\naccurately predict the state of the microgrid and detect anomalous events (e.g. ramps in\r\namount of solar PV produced and electrical grid outages). Once accurate models are\r\nconstructed and verified through simulations and data gathering, the third project\r\nprovides decision-making capability for the microgrid using distributed control and\r\noptimization algorithms to create a secure and stable microgrid to reduces costs and\r\nenergy use. Students and faculty will work in a newly created smart campus energy lab\r\n(SCEL) which will house the data and networking components of the UHM campus\r\nmicrogrid.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: UHM researchers and students will be able to combine what they\r\nlearn in the classroom with theoretical and practical research projects in the SCEL and on\r\nthe UHM campus microgrid. This understanding and practical knowledge will lead to\r\nbetter insight on the design and integration of new technology for the microgrid and\r\nfuture utility-scale smart grids. Through collaborations with the Native Hawaiian\r\nScience and Engineering Mentorship Program (NHSEMP) and the Society of Women\r\nEngineers (SWE), the project will also target underrepresented students. This project\r\ndiffers from other smart sustainable microgrids being deployed at other academic\r\ninstitutions and communities as our energy profile is unique (Hawaii pays the highest\r\nelectricity prices in the nation), we will incorporate large shares of distributed renewable\r\nenergy (rooftop PV), and Hawai`i has unique micro-climates (no heating and wide\r\nvariability in rainfall and cloud cover).",
