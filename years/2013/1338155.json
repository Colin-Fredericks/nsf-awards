Adaptability constitutes the key feature enabling the creation of diverse instruments for computer science research. The work is geared towards representing a new generation of testbed instruments that engage a broader community of users by empowering them to customize it to their needs. The instrument is expected to leverage and drive the trends in cloud computing, thus making the development of adaptable instrument environments easier, cheaper, and less risky. At the same time, it offers properties not available on commercial clouds, including the proposed levels of resource fidelity and transparency required of a scientific instrument. The project also develops the control and management system for creating and using profiles, and for supporting concurrent experiments and allocating resources among them in a dynamic manner. The fundamental building blocks of Apt identified include: \r\n-\tResource provisioning, scheduling, and conditioning; \r\n-\tOperational state tracking; experiment management, archive, and replay; and \r\n-\tUser management. \r\nThis work contributes to make these elements reusable in a way that enables the proposed to be shared by profiles supporting a wide range of research domains. The domains currently targeted include, but are not limited to, sustainable energy control systems, biomolecular science, privacy and security, and data-intensive computation.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe instrument is expected to be a national resource for computer science and other computing-based fields, Internet-accessible and to contribute to the nation?s cyberinfrastructure. The broad and diverse targeted research communities include strong empirical and experimental components. The proposed instrument is highly suitable for training and education.",
