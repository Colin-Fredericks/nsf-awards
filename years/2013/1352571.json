 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds a workshop to bring together researchers supported by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) activity. As NSF's response to the President's Materials Genome Initiative, DMREF seeks to foster tight collaborations between materials researchers in experiment, theory, and computation. These collaborations are founded on highly iterative feedback loops in which experimental results directly inform theory and computation, and vice versa, with the goal of accelerating the discovery and development of new materials. The workshop will provide researchers a forum to share their research results and discuss cross-cutting topics related to establishing and sustaining research collaborations, managing digital data, and supporting long-term simulation software development. \r\n\r\nThis nascent community can provide leadership to the broader materials research community in implementing strategies to achieve the goals set out by the Materials Genome Initiative, including reducing both the cost and time it takes to bring a new material to market. The workshop will address both successes and challenges faced at the early stages of research, particularly for highly collaborative projects, and will help solidify newly-formed collaborations. Overarching themes identified through presentations and discussions will be presented in a report for dissemination to the broader materials research community and will help inform future research programs. The workshop will be held in Arlington, Virginia, on September 8-10, 2013.",
