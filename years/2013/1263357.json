 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to UCSF that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2016. The program offers state of the art hands-on training in the methods and logic of Molecular Biosciences with a goal of facilitating successful transition to graduate research. Interdisciplinary faculty expertise is drawn broadly from the fields of genetics/genomics; biochemistry; cell/developmental biology; systems/synthetic biology and bioengineering.  The centerpiece of the program is an intensive research experience to learn modern technologies and how to use them creatively to solve research problems. REU students have access to a rich array of facilities for their research. Students also participate in seminars and workshops including: responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Additionally students meet weekly in small groups with a teaching assistant to learn to communicate science and digest the research experience.  The program culminates with oral and poster presentations. The program aims to increase the scientific workforce by recruiting groups underrepresented in science including minority/disadvantaged/disabled students, those from colleges with limited research opportunities, and first in family to attend college. Recruiting strategies include attendance at national meetings (SACNAS, ABRCMS), visits to campuses in the California State University system, website information, and mailings to universities across the country. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research.  Letters from previous research mentors, including those of mentors from previous summer programs are of particular importance.  Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting http://graduate.ucsf.edu/content/summer-research-opportunities or by contacting the PI (Dr. Carol Gross:  cgrossucsf@gmail.com) or the co-PI (Dr. Hana El Samad: Hana.El-Samad@ucsf.edu)",
