 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop new algorithmic techniques for the\r\ndesign of and routing in data networks. Classical network optimization\r\nproblems address transportation networks that carry physical\r\ncommodities. Data networks are fundamentally different --- data can be\r\nmodified, compressed, and replicated at little cost. Incorporating\r\nthis flexibility in altering traffic into network optimization\r\nproblems can bring about a considerable improvement in the capacities\r\nof communication networks.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to revisit classical network optimization problems\r\nwithin a new model where the cost of carrying data is non-linear and\r\ndepends on its compressibility. It aims to provide theoretical\r\nunderpinnings for new WAN optimization approaches proposed in the\r\nnetworking literature, including, for example, traffic redundancy\r\nelimination.\r\n\r\nThe PI considers a model where links in the network can compress data and\r\nremove duplicate packets. For example, if two traffic streams contain\r\nidentical data and use overlapping routes, edges carrying both streams\r\nneed only transmit the common packets once; these can then be\r\nreplicated at routers where the streams diverge. Accordingly, the load\r\non an edge is a submodular function of the traffic streams that use\r\nthe edge. Unlike previous work on network optimization with non-linear\r\ncosts, in this model, the cost of routing depends on the identities of\r\nthe traffic streams involved, and not just on the total traffic\r\nvolume. Most of the problems considered are computationally\r\nintractable and the PI aims to develop approximation algorithms.\r\n\r\nSeveral graduate and undergraduate courses will benefit from this project.",
