 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the mass-independent fractionation (MIF) effect that leads to enrichment of stratospheric ozone in heavy isotopes of oxygen (17O and 18O). The theory for treating this ozone forming reaction will be further developed using a mixed quantum/classical method to characterize the collisional energy transfer without using reduced-dimension approximations. The use of several atmospheric bath gases will be studied as quenchers for the reaction. The MIF of oxygen in the ozone-forming reaction has been shown to disappear when a very efficient molecular quencher, such as SF6, is used. The emphasis of the project will be on moving from the analytic model to a master-equation treatment of the kinetics. The project will also include the first-ever quantum dynamic calculations for the formation of ozone on surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of O3 has a significant impact on our understanding of the ozone's chemistry, production, lifetime and loss in the atmosphere, and the effect ozone has on global climate change. The advances made in further elucidating the MIF of O3 will provide the key to understanding the MIF for several other molecules, such as stratospheric CO2, N2O and CO. The isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 is often used to identify its sources and further characterization of the MIF of CO2 will lead to an increased understanding of the global carbon budget.",

This reaction involves two steps:&nbsp;formation of the metastable ozone species O<sub>3</sub>* from oxygen molecules and atoms, and their stabilization by collisions with bath gas M:</p>\n<p>O<sub>2</sub> + O &lt;=&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;O<sub>3</sub>*,</p>\n<p>O<sub>3</sub>* + M --&gt; O<sub>3</sub> + M.</p>\n<p>This process is known to exhibit large and intricate isotope effects that manifest in significant variations of abundances of the isotopically substituted ozone molecules, such as <sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O, <sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O, <sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;and <sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O. Physical origin of these effects remained poorly understood for several decades.</p>\n<p>In order to reproduce and explain these isotope effects, the rates of formation and decay of the metastable ozone species (first step of the recombination process) were predicted by accurate quantum dynamics calculations of the so-called scattering resonances. Rotational and vibrational motion of the ozone molecule was described rigorously using the method of hyper-spherical coordinates in conjunction with several numerically efficient techniques, such as sequential diagonalization-truncation, optimized non-equidistant grids, and the&nbsp;complex absorbing potential. These calculations produce accurate spectrum of the vibrational states of ozone. Figure 1&nbsp;illustrates wave functions of several highly-excited vibrational states of ozone near dissociation threshold. When the rotational excitation is introduced, these states are pushed up above the threshold&nbsp;and become the metastable O<sub>3</sub>* states that contribute to the recombination. For quenching of the metastable O<sub>3</sub>* (second step of the process) a state-of-the-art quantum-classical theory&nbsp;of collisional energy transfer was developed and applied to predict the rates of stabilization of the symmetric (<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O)&nbsp;and asymmetric (<sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O and <sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O)&nbsp;ozone molecules.

In order to examine isotope effects, that are more sensitive to the details of the process, a hierarchy of theory levels for the recombination kinetics was developed. Such systematic approach permitted to determine the roles of various physical factors in the recombination process and in the&nbsp;isotope effects. First of all, it was rigorously shown that the molecular symmetry itself does not lead to any isotope effect, if the multi-channel nature of the process is properly taken into account. Figure 3 illustrates three distinct recombination pathways (<em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>S</em>) introduced for the formation of isotopically substituted ozone. Next, it was shown that a simplified description of the reaction path, similar to the treatment&nbsp;of this reaction using statistical mechanics, leads to the relatively small isotope effects, insufficient to explain the available experimental data. It was also demonstrated that quantum tunneling, responsible for formation of the so-called \"shape\" resonances, makes a relatively small contribution to the process, and the isotope effect associated with it is inconsistent with experiment. This possibility was ruled out.</p>\n<p>Finally, it was demonstrated that the so-called Feshbach resonances, enables by couplings between the vibrational channels in the ozone formation process, make the most significant contribution to the overall reaction and are also responsible for the isotope effects observed in experiments. Properties of the Feshbach resonances were studied in detail for the three pathways <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>S</em> of singly- and doubly-substituted ozone molecules. Two isotope effects were introduced and examined: One is the so called zeta-effect specific to the asymmetric ozone molecules such as <sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;or <sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O, that manifests in a very large difference (on the order of 60%) between the rates of formation of these molecules through two possible reaction channels <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. The other important feature is the so-called eta-effect that manifests as a lowered rate of formation (by 16%) of the symmetric ozone molecules, such as <sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O or <sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O, compared to the asymmetric once. It was found that the zeta-effect is reproduced rather&nbsp;well, and the eta-effects is partially reproduced by present model. It is suggested that inclusion of Coriolis couplings, neglected at the present level of theory, may be needed to capture the remaining piece of the&nbsp;eta-effect.</p>\n<p>These theoretical and computational models will help atmospheric chemists to&nbsp;rationalize&nbsp;the molecular-level origin of the isotope effect in ozone, that&nbsp;in turn leads to the mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in the atmosphere of Earth.
