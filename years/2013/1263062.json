The REU Site will bring talented undergraduates from a national network of four-year colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions, and regional Community Colleges to the UMN campus for an intensive 10-week research experience. The UMN MRSEC comprises four Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) addressing pressing problems over a wide range of \"soft\" to \"hard\" materials: polymers, organic electronics, magnetic materials, and nanoparticles.  MRSEC faculty and students are based in six different science and engineering departments, assuring a particularly broad and interdisciplinary experience for all the participants. The research advisors/mentors represent an appealing blend of junior, senior, and mid-career faculty; all are acknowledged leaders in their fields. Undergraduate research training is comprised of three fundamental and essential elements: (i) providing an independent intensive research project unavailable for most at their home institutions; (ii) developing effective multi-tiered mentoring relationships between student participants and faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows with whom they work; and (iii) enhancing those skills students need in preparation for graduate school (technical writing, oral presentation, ethical issues, GRE practice), while providing undergraduate students with a realistic preview of the graduate school experience.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\nThe University of Minnesota, Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) acknowledges the support of the Division of Materials Research of the National Science Foundation for funding of the UMN MRSEC REU Site in Nanomaterials. The UMN MRSEC comprises four Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) addressing pressing problems over a wide range of \"soft\" to \"hard\" materials: polymers, organic electronics, magnetic materials, and nanoparticles.  The REU/RET program will provide high-quality research and education experiences in Materials Science and Engineering, primarily to students from undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities (64% of participants for previous award), and to high school teachers principally from the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The Center has demonstrated consistent and growing success at including women and members of underrepresented groups (49% and 38% respectively, in the previous REU award, DMR-0754792) in these activities, enabled by long-term partnerships with four- and two-year colleges, and Minority Serving Institutions. The inherently interdisciplinary nature of MRSEC research is particularly important for training the next generation of scientists and engineers and assuring U.S. competitiveness. We envision this comprehensive program, in both its scope and execution, as a means of meeting many of the challenges set forth by the National Academy of Sciences assessment of the state of science and engineering education discussed in its 1997 publication, Rising Above the Gathering Storm",

We have demonstrated consistent and growing success at including women and members of underrepresented groups in these activities. The inherently interdisciplinary nature of MRSEC research is particularly important for training the next generation of scientists and engineers and assuring U.S. competitiveness.\n\nThe MRSEC REU Site in Nanomaterials (DMR# 1263062) recruited talented and diverse cohorts of students to prepare them for a future in graduate school and/or research careers.  The program provided intense, ten-week, individual research projects to each student under the direct mentorship of MRSEC faculty, graduate students, and postdocs.  Participants were trained in techniques and methodology required for their project and had full, hands-on access to the world-class instrumentation at UMN.  The individual ownership of the projects and quality of research is shown by the 13 journal publications over the award period listing REU/RET participants as co-authors.  To complement the research experience, students participated in an extensive program of professional development activities.  The professional development activities were planned as a means to expose participants to the breadth of research and career opportunities in Materials Science and provide them with the skills necessary to pursue those opportunities.  Students attended weekly research seminars and participated in workshops on technical writing, presentation skills, graduate application process, and scientific ethics. Participants were also exposed to industrial research through visits to local companies. In practice, students applied what they learned by giving formal research seminars at the end of the program and presenting their work at a plenary poster session attended by the university and industrial science community.\n\nThe MRSEC REU program has had significant success in broadening participation in STEM by recruiting diverse cohorts of students.  Over the three years of this award, 59% of MRSEC REU participants have come from groups underrepresented in STEM and 38% have been women- both significantly higher than national averages in engineering.  Additionally, the program has been successful at preparing participants for graduate school and professional careers as evidenced by the high numbers of participants enrolling in graduate programs (83%) and continuing on to technical careers (95%).  Evaluation of the program has shown significant improvements in technical lab skills and scientific presentation skills (Figure 1).\n\nThe Research Experiences for Teachers component of the program provided teachers with the research and technical skills necessary to introduce their students to engineering concepts in the classroom.  Teachers participated for 6-weeks per summer over two years, working in MRSEC faculty research labs. Similar to the REU program, each teacher was given an independent research project and attended seminars a..."
