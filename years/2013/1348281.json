 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five-year project is a joint effort among the colleges of Education, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering at the University of Kentucky.  The goal is to increase middle school students' interest and motivation to learn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content through providing opportunities to develop identities as STEM learners and future scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. The project focuses on examining the effect of informal STEM learning environments on students in grades 5-8, particularly females and students of color, by engaging them in hands-on activities provided through summer STEM camps and academic-year STEM clubs.   The model of increasing the STEM engagement and interest in middle school students in the Fayette County can be scaled, replicated, and adapted in other regions of Kentucky and across the nation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project strengthens two existing programs: the See Blue STEM Camp, run during summer, and the See Blue STEM Club, offered throughout the academic year, by including the development of several hands-on activities.  Examples include Crime Scene Investigation involving analysis of chemicals and dusting for fingerprints, model solar car designing and building, and robotics.  Pre-service teachers and engineering students at the undergraduate and graduate levels from the University of Kentucky are also involved, contributing to and benefiting from the summer and academic year programs.  The project evaluation includes formative and summative aspects and provides useful information on the effectiveness of the middle school student engagement in informal STEM clubs and camps.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe project provides solid, replicable, well-tested, and evaluated models for recruiting and conducting both a STEM Camp on a University campus and a STEM Club in an urban community that targets diverse middle school students. The project plans to engage over 700 middle school students, with at least 60% being from groups underrepresented in STEM. The summer camps include not only the students but their parents as well through social media (blog, Twitter) and nightly emails. All curricula and instructional materials will be made available online via Kentucky's public STEM education website so that they may be replicated, continually modified, and sustained beyond the life of the project.  Research results will be made available through publications and conference presentations.",

Over the life of the project, the See Blue See STEM summer experiences were established, sustained, and replicated at three additional sites. The project started with rising middle grades (grades 5-8) and ended with including elementary (grades 2-4) and high school (grades 9-12). Between Summer 2014 - Summer 2019, the camp provided opportunity and access to high quality, hands-on STEM Experiences to 1621 students. Of these, 39.7% were female and 25.0% were students of color. Overall, the project exceeded its goal of providing opportunity and access to at least 50% underrepresented populations (especially students of color and females) - the summer experiences alone were 62.2% underrepresented populations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Participation in an informal learning environment, such as the summer STEM experiences, influences students' perceptions of STEM in the following ways: (a) It gave context and purpose to the formal learning environment. Students connected their experiences in the summer camps to future STEM learning in two distinct ways: understanding how the content is applicable to other situations; and, seeing the content come to life through hands-on activities. (b) It created Opportunity and Access to Authentic Experiences. Participants referenced the opportunities and access the informal learning environment provided them. Students commonly compared their formal learning experiences with those at camp. STEM camp activities were described as hands-on, interactive, and experimental while school activities focused on testing, worksheets, and audio-visual learning. In a broader perspective, access to the professionals, curriculum, content, and environments central to the STEM camp experience built students up where they had previously felt inadequate or poorly adept. Students perceived STEM differently, but how they perceived themselves also evolved. They perceived themselves as capable, confident, brave, and, above all, like they fit into the STEM community. (c) The STEM (content) learning came alive through student engagement. Students had an opportunity to experience activities they never experienced such as programming robots, dissecting fetal pigs, and playing with fruit flies. These experiences extended their STEM content knowledge and piqued their interest and engagement. Unfortunately, many students discussed how they did not experience these \"fun activities\" at their school. The students were excited about all of the experiments and learning and really wanted to stay engaged. Students expressed the camp allowed them to be creative and use and apply their STEM skills.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But do informal STEM learning experiences impact test score achievement in the classroom? When comparing summer experience participants (this group was chosen because it was the group we had the most complete information in order to create a matched, non participation group) to students who did not participate, overall, state test scores were higher for the summer experience participants during the transition years of 6th and 7th grade. Females showed significatly higher differences in 7th grade math state test scores, with participants out-performing non-participants. Overall underrepresented populations showed significantly higher differences in both 6th and 7th grade state math test scores.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overall this project sought to increase interest in STEM careers through opportunity and access. In this project, students were engaged in authentic hands-on activities and saw how STEM applies to their lives, which increased their interest in STEM careers. Many students were influenced by their desire to help others and make the world a better place (empathy). Some students recognized how their STEM learning experiences could be applied to improve the world. This project solidified and piqued many students? interest in STEM careers. Many students were drawn to a specific STEM career because they wanted to help a person for whom they care about, such as a sibling with an illness.
