 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the creation of a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of South Carolina.   This site will provide a 10-week summer research experience for 8 participants. The REU site will leverage the expertise of the USC Physics and Astronomy faculty in areas of nuclear and particle physics, nanotechnology, and theoretical/computational modeling to advance the understanding of the fundamental physical interactions that govern the structure and substance of matter on microscopic and microscopic scales.   In addition to research, participants will engage in weekly educational activities, which will teach research strategies, ethics, and career strategies. Planned social activities will build a sense of community among mentors and participants. The summer will conclude with a symposium, during which participants will present their research findings in both a poster and an oral presentation. The presentation materials are designed such that participants will leave the program with the materials necessary to present their research at national and regional meetings.",

There was a special emphasis on recruiting three groups of students:  women (who have historically been extremely underrepresented in physics), underrepresented minorities, and students from colleges (especially those in the Southeast) with limited opportunities to do research at their home institutions.  This had the beneficial effect of broadening participation in research training.\n\nThe students participated in research in many different areas of physics and astronomy:  observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, solid state physics, biological physics, experimental nuclear physics, and theoretical particle physics.  The research was conducted under the supervision of experienced faculty mentors, with the REU students participating as integrated members of the Univeristy of South Carolina physics and astronomy department's research groups.  Some students were engaged in direct data collection in laboratories located on campus.  Others were engaged in analysis of data collected at off-campus shared use facilities, including several telescopes and the Thomas Jeffereson National Accelerator Facilities.\n\nTo further support the students, they were part of a seminar series that brought together all the summer undergraduate research students from different programs on campus.
