The mechanisms by which various membrane proteins impart vital functions to natural bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) are poorly understood, particularly at the molecular and atomic scales. Although there is a critical need to understand the structure and function of novel membrane proteins, discoveries are limited by the substantial bottleneck of preparing and executing detailed experimental studies. \r\n\r\nObjective: The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to establish new technologies and methodologies for coupling microelectronics with biological interfaces that will enable high throughput characterization of membrane proteins. To achieve this goal, we propose to design a lab-on-CMOS platform that integrates a 1000-element array of microfluidic planar-BLM chambers with embedded CMOS electrochemical instrumentation circuits. The proposed approaches will overcome significant technical barriers and contribute new mechanisms for silicon-to-protein communication pathways, enabling new directions for future research activities and commercial products. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed approaches for coupling microelectronics with biological interfaces would overcome significant technical barriers and contribute new mechanisms for silicon-to-protein communication pathways, enabling a new direction for future research activities and commercial products. These approaches will be incorporated into the proposed model instrument which will itself provide ground-breaking new capabilities for high throughput biomembrane characterization enabling significant subsequent advances in many fields of biology, nanomaterials, and medicine. The research efforts would also advance scientific and engineering knowledge in two primary areas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: A model instrument will be developed with new capabilities for high throughput biomembrane characterization, enabling significant subsequent advances in many fields that could transform the frontiers of knowledge, advance our fundamental understanding of basic biological processes, and aid in the generation of new, engineered membrane proteins for sensor platforms, high throughput drug screening, and development of new medical diagnostics and disease treatments, all with wide-reaching benefits to society. Results of the multidisciplinary research will be integrated into education by direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate student researchers, development and delivery of a precollege STEM presentation, and participation in a novel project-based Multidisciplinary\r\nBioprocessing Laboratory course. In addition, research experience will be provided for a secondary education science teacher who will integrate the experience into a teaching module for K-12 programs, including opportunities that target students from underrepresented groups. The results of this project will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and websites of the investigators and their associated research centers.",

Frist, an ultra-compact micro-watt CMOS current readout circuit with pico-ampere noise was developed. This circuit introduced a method for pixel-level current readout featuring a new group-cluster circuit architecture to simultaneously address the challenges of high resolution (for single molecule detection), fast speed (for observing rapidly-occurring membrane protein activity) and small size (for on-chip array implementation). Fabricated in 0.5 &micro;m CMOS, the circuit achieved 7.2 pArms noise in an 11.5 kHz bandwidth, and only consumed 21 &mu;W power and 0.06 mm2 area per channel. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in a potassium ferricyanide solution and patch-clamp whole-cell experiments were performed to validate the circuit&rsquo;s feasibility for electrochemical biosensor applications. The second major outcome was the establishment of a novel platform for integrating CMOS biosensor array chips with multi-channel microfluidics. Dubbed &ldquo;lab-on-CMOS&rdquo; because it enables combining lab-on-chip and CMOS microelectronics technologies, this integration platform featured an epoxy chip-in-carrier to expand the surface of a CMOS instrumentation chip in an inexpensive manner. To route electrical signals to the edge of the device for external connection, planar interconnects were formed using a new screen printed polymer silver process. The chip-in-carrier assembly readily permits attachment of an independently-designed multi-channel microfluidic device containing reaction chambers over biosensor sites on the surface of the CMOS instrumentation chip and other functional microfluidic structures such as mixers. A fully integrated lab-on-CMOS device was implemented using a CMOS electrochemical readout chip. Test samples were delivered using the on-board microfluidics, and no leaks were observed on the chip-in-carrier assembly. To validate biosensor measurement capability, the on-board CMOS instrumentation chip successfully recorded reactions at the on-CMOS electrode sites. This device demonstrated, for the first time, on-CMOS electrochemical measurement using monolithically integrated multi-channel microfluidics. Together, these two outcomes of this NSF project introduce a new approach for high throughput characterization of biosensors, including membrane proteins, that could enable a new generation of biomedical research tools and healthcare diagnostic devices for applications including rapid drug screening and real-time biomedical analysis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/21/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mason</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075537582_LoCMOS_concept--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075537582_LoCMOS_concept--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lab-on-CMOS concept\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075537582_LoCMOS_concept--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lab-on-CMOS concept\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Concept of the lab-on-CMOS platform integrating CMOS biosensor arrays and multi-channel microfludics.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">A.Mason</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mason</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lab-on-CMOS concept</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075689244_Lin_LoCMOS_closeup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075689244_Lin_LoCMOS_closeup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LoCMOS_closeup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1307939/1307939_10248157_1477075689244_Lin_LoCMOS_closeup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LoCMOS_closeup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Closeup photograph of a fabricated lab-on-CMOS device with CMOS biosensor chip, planar interconnects and multi-channel microfluidics.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">A.Mason, L.Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mason</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LoCMOS_closeup</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
