 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent survey conducted among developers of the Apache, Eclipse, and\r\nMozilla projects showed that the ability to recreate field\r\nfailures--failures of the software that occur after deployment, on\r\nuser machines--is considered of fundamental importance when\r\ninvestigating bug reports. Unfortunately, the information typically\r\ncontained in a bug report, such as memory dumps or call stacks, is\r\nusually insufficient for recreating the problem. Even more advanced\r\napproaches for gathering field data and help in-house debugging tend\r\nto provide too little information to developers and to be therefore\r\nineffective.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the state of the art by\r\nallowing, supporting, and partially automating, actual in-house\r\ndebugging of field failures. Specifically, this research will develop\r\nnovel techniques and tools that let developers reproduce, analyze, and\r\nunderstand, in-house, failures observed in the field. Given a field\r\nfailure, the developed techniques will (1) collect a suitable set of\r\ndata about the failure on the user machine, (2) generate one or more\r\ninputs that can be executed against the failing application and result\r\nin a failure analogous to the one observed, and (3) provide hints on\r\nthe root causes of the failure and possible fixes for these causes. To\r\nachieve this goal, the research will combine static and dynamic\r\nprogram analysis techniques and leverage and extend techniques for\r\ntesting deployed software, input generation and anonymization, and\r\nsoftware debugging. If successful, this research will provide\r\nunprecedented advantages to developers by allowing them to debug field\r\nfailures in the same way in which they debug in-house ones, which will\r\nimprove software quality and benefit all segments of society that\r\ndepend on software. Furthermore, the project will develop and make\r\navailable to the broader scientific community educational materials\r\nthat incorporate research findings, tools that implement the\r\ntechniques developed within the project, and samples of the software\r\nbenchmarks used in empirical evaluations. The availability of\r\ncurriculum materials, tools, infrastructure, and benchmarks will\r\nadvance knowledge, enable additional research in the area, and\r\nultimately further benefit society.",
