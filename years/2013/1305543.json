The research encompasses synthesis, spectroscopic evaluation, molecular recognition and material science and provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe proposed catalysts are of outstanding scientific and industrial interest and are expected to provide a novel platform for a shortened synthesis of glycoconjugates and biomarkers of potential pharmacological importance as a long term goal. Further broader impacts on society include outreach efforts of the team to local high and middle schools, and the development of new classroom teaching styles to facilitate student retention, increase graduate rate, and decrease costs and preparation time until graduation.",
