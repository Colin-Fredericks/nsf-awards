ICIBM 2013 will facilitate programs that cater to multiple levels of research expertise so that those just beginning their research career can gain the highest level of training and information from experts and innovators, and those continuing with their research at higher levels have communication and collaborative opportunities that will significantly increase the success of research overall.  To further disseminate the most innovative interdisciplinary research the program will include distinguished keynote lectures, innovative tutorial session, and research presentations. ICIBM 2013?s commitment to education and diversity, as evidenced by its support of underrepresented students and trainees, its unique training opportunities, and its inclusiveness even among its committees (including a culturally and disciplinarily diverse Trainee Committee to include young scientists more thoroughly), highlights it as an unprecedented resource for within bioinformatics, systems biology, intelligent computing, and related fields. These areas of research integrate science and engineering knowledge with modern, state-of-the-art intelligent computing technology.",
