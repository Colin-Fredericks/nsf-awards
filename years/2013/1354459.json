 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports organization of the workshop that brings together thought leaders from industry and academia to discuss use-case scenarios for use of robots in small and medium sized enterprises. The objective of the workshop is (1) to present and discuss industry use-cases for robotics in manufacturing and in particular examples where a move from fixed automation to flexible automation is an economic enabler and (2) to have broad discussions across academia and industry to internalize a common set of challenges and opportunities. The workshop participants gain new insights into what advances needed to deploy robotics in small and medium manufacturers. The workshop report provides a roadmap of challenges and research opportunities to guide the robotics community. The workshop stimulates future research towards development of robots for manufacturing applications.  These activities directly impact the U.S. manufacturing.",
