 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team has developed a method to produce anti-counterfeit tags based on periodic arrays of nanopillars that can be realized on any surfaces including textiles. Both overt and covert images can be created using patterns from hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopillars domains taking advantage of the inkjet layer-by-layer assembly. The hidden images are then visualized for authenticity verification by fogging them with human breath. By utilizing scalable nanopillar arrays from polyurethane, this technology may also be less costly than other options.\r\n\r\nThis technology presents a reliable platform to make periodic, densely packed hole and pillary arrays with tunable optical and surface properties, which has many technological applications. Nanopillar technology offers a new tool to combat such large-scale economic problems such as counterfeit goods that affect the US economy. Preparation of wear-resistant nanopillar features on a wide range of common materials including fabric, glass, plastic, etc enables their wide-scale utilization capable of advancing other technologies besides counterfeit tags that include energy applications (e.g. self-cleaning durable coatings for solar cells) and biomedical technologies (e.g. anti-biofouling coatings).",
