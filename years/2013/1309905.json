 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis research will explore the use of highly-integrated power electronics to improve the energy production of photovoltaic (PV) systems. We will develop a process for 3-D integration of power magnetics, power conversion circuitry, and a range of moderate to high density capacitor technologies using commercially available CMOS technologies and custom back-end processing.  A second focus will be on efficient, high power-density circuit designs that can exploit the maximum capabilities of integrated passive and active devices. In particular, we will explore the use of resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) converters, used in partial power processing architectures that can be integrated with groups of PV cells at the sub-module level to efficiently and cost effectively mitigate power that is lost due to mismatch at the cell, module, and system level. Targets include achieving effective conversion efficiencies over 99% for a range of operating scenarios, insertion loss below 0.1%, and a roadmap for cost of module-integrated electronics below 5 \u00a2/Wp.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nPresently, variations among PV cells and differences in how much insolation they receive greatly limit the practical energy extraction that is possible and impose undesired constraints on the system configuration and grid interface electronics. The proposed research aims to eliminate these obstacles, resulting in PV systems of much greater robustness, flexibility and energy extraction capability, while maintaining low cost of the conversion electronics. Developing power electronics solutions and components that can be fully integrated in silicon integrated circuits (ICs) can support the path to grid-parity for PV systems, but can also impact other areas of acute need such as LED lighting, and power delivery for a range of consumer and industrial electronics.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the tools and techniques developed in this project will be used extensively for teaching and dissemination of scientific knowledge to the next generation of engineers, scientists and educators. The research will augment the educational experience at Dartmouth in specific courses and the broader curriculum. The program will also be used to enhance our community outreach efforts. Dartmouth K-12 outreach, including regular classroom visits by the principal investigators and involvement in summer engineering workshops for high-school students will motivate new activities that leverage students' interest in solar energy to drive engagement with technical concepts, helping to make these concepts accessible and meaningful.",
