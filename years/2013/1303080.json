 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n\tMulti-scale theoretical (time-dependent density functional theory and coarse-grained Monte Carlo-molecular dynamics) methods are being developed and will used to guide the development of new macromolecular (polymer and dendrimer) electroactive materials with particular focus on electro-optic materials critical for chipscale integration of electronics and photonics.  Theory-guided design will permit control of both molecular architecture (molecular order and lattice dimensionality) and dynamics (viscoelasticity and phase transitions).  New experimental methods are being developed to characterize order, lattice dimensionality, and viscoelasticity.  Newly synthesized and characterized organic electro-optic materials will be integrated with silicon photonic, plasmonic, and metamaterial devices relevant to telecommunications, computing, and sensing technologies.  Collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory, industry (Boeing, Intel, and other companies), and with international researchers (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium) will be pursued.  Workforce development and promotion of workforce diversity will be pursued through continued interactions with minority serving institutions including HBCUs (e.g., Norfolk State University), Hispanic and Native American institutions. Undergraduate and high school student participation in research will also be facilitated.  The potential broader economic impacts of science will be emphasized by working with the UW Center for Innovation and Technology Entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n\tProperties of electroactive (e.g., photovoltaic, electronic, electro-optic) materials depend on the organization of component atoms, ions, or molecules.  The utilization of soft matter materials has been inhibited by lack of theory-guided design to achieve the desired order and performance properties.  New theoretical methods will be developed that will permit such rational design leading to new electro-optic materials and permitting the fabrication of compact information technology devices exhibiting ultrahigh-speed and low power-consumption data processing.  Such technology is important to chipscale integration of electronics and photonics, and in turn to next-generation computing, telecommunications, and sensing technologies.  The anticipated outcome of this basic research program should be of potential interest to industry.  Workforce development and enhancement of workforce diversity will be pursued through a variety of mechanisms including continued interaction with HBCUs (e.g., Norfolk State University), Hispanic, and Native American institutions, and through facilitation of the participation of undergraduate and high school students in research.  Broader impact will also be achieved through the University of Washington Center for Innovation and Technology Entrepreneurship.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChipscale integration of electronics and photonics is recognized as having the potential for a transformative impact on next generation information technology, providing dramatic improvements in bandwidth performance, energy efficiency, and thermal management.  This advance is recognized as central to transitioning photonics from niche market status to broad commercialization analogous to that of CMOS electronics.  A substantial challenge impeding such integration is the current dramatic size mismatch of between commercially-available electronic and photonic circuit elements.  For example, the largest critical dimension of a critical active element of photonic circuitry (the electro-optic modulator) has until recently been on the order of centimeters while critical largest dimensions for active electronic elements are on the order of micrometers or smaller.  For chipscale integration to be effective, electro-optic devices (critical for active interconversion of information between electronic and photonic domains), the length of commercial photonic modulators must be reduced by a factor of 10,000.  At the same time, energy efficiency must be improved by an even greater factor and operational bandwidth by more than an order of magnitude.  Material electro-optic activity defines fundamental limits with respect to device length, energy efficiency, and bandwidth; thus, improvement in parameters relevant to chipscale integration and transformative improvements in device size, weight, power, performance, cost, and reliability depend on improving material electro-optic activity.  NSF-supported research has developed and utilized new multi-scale theoretical simulation methods for theory-guided design of new electro-optic materials to improve device voltage-length performance from 40 volt-centimeter (current commercial device value) to 40 volt-micrometer, which is a factor of 10,000 improvement.  This improvement has yielded sub-femtojoule (attojoule)/bit energy efficiencies, bandwidths greater than 150 GHz, and device lengths of less than 10 micrometers (device footprints on the order of 10 micrometerssquared).  This has led to record performance in telecommunications.  Project research has also led to record performance in sensor technology.  A nanoscopic antenna structure using electro-optic materials produced in this project has permitted direct conversion of wireless (RF) communications to fiber optics without use of any electronics.  This device is also an exceptional broadband radiofrequency (RF) detector including for frequencies extending into the terahertz.  These research advances are of relevance to telecommunication, computing, defense, transportation, and medical technologies.  Dramatic improvement in multi-scale theoretical methods has been achieved, including in quantum and statistical mechanical simulation methods appropriate for the simulation of complex macromolecular (soft matter) materials.  Never before achieved simulation of the physical properties of complex macromolecular (soft matter) materials has been achieved.  In addition to solid state materials, the dielectric permittivity of dipolar liquids has been quantitatively simulated for the first time with record computational speed.  New simulation algorithms have been shown to be applicable to both flexible and rigid rod macromolecular materials and strong dipolar, quadrupolar, and ionic interactions can be treated as well as more traditional and weaker non-bonding intermolecular interactions.  Thus, the new algorithms are appropriate for simulation of polymers, colloids, and biomaterials as well as the classes of materials already noted.  A graduate student associated with this project is exploring starting a software company to commercialize this simulation technology and another graduate student has launched (with venture capital support) a company to commercialize materials produced by this research.  Two other device focused companies are also being launched and cooperative R&amp;D is being discussed and implemented with corporations both large and small. Substantial technology/information transfer to industry and Federal laboratories has been achieved in addition to academic institutions.  Workforce development, including enhancement of workforce diversity, has been pursued through interaction with minority serving institutions such as Norfolk State University and through service to OXIDE (the NSF/DoE/NIH supported Open Chemistry Collaborative on Diversity Equity) and through organizing an American Chemical Symposium on Diversity Equity. Investigators involved in this research played important roles in establishing the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship of the University of Washington School of Business and serve as judges for the Alaska Airline Environmental Challenge.  They serve on the State of Washington Clean Energy Fund (Department of Commerce) and chair committees related to environmental quality and sustainability.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry R Dalton"
