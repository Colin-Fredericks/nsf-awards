 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pursue the development of unitary qubit lattice algorithms (QULA) to solve problems in nonlinear physics by extending ideas used in lattice Boltzmann and lattice gas algorithms. QULA for scalar 2D and 3D Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) have already provided new information on the unexpected behavior of continuum Hamiltonians. The major thrust of this project will be to examine energy spectral cascades in spinor-BEC quantum turbulence where the flow involves both Abelian and non-Abelian vortices.  Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics. This research is also expected to have a profound impact on plasma and space physics applications, as QULA will allow for the study of magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence and magnetic reconnection. The QULA algorithms are manifestly unitary and can be readily encoded onto future quantum computers.\r\n\r\nThe broad impacts of this project include the training of the workforce of the future, with graduate and undergraduate students having the opportunity to learn and work in an important field of scientific inquiry. Students will acquire hands-on experience on the use of high-performance computational platforms, as QULA scale ideally on modern supercomputers and the scaling was tested up to several hundreds of thousands of cores.",

Our interests here are to examine various types of vortex reconnections and their effect on the dynamics of BEC - including for those BECs that are in spinor-states so the flow can now also involve non-Abelian vortices (the ones with fractional quantized circulations). When we moved from scalar to spinor-state BECs, we first tried to modify the algorithm with a different form of collision operator. The need for this was to permit interaction strengths strong enough for us to move into the parameter regime appropriate for the studies. Attempt for higher order accuracy of kinetic energy term by Fourier streaming approach was successful when applied to 1D - Benchmark simulations were in excellent agreement with the exact theoretical results and permit soliton speeds much higher than possible by the current algorithm, which is second order accurate. However, when extended to 3D, the need to perform FFTs back and forth for each time step was detrimental to the parallel performance of algorithm, and so decided not to pursue any further for spinor BECs. With qubits at mesoscale level, there is no intrinsic energy integral; but if the desired GP equation is satisfied in the continuum limit [to order of O(&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>)], then the computation of total energy by the model from qubits must be conserved. Another numerical intricacy is the level of unitarity in algorithm, especially when nonlinear terms for spin interactions are needed to incorporate. Recently, either by forced diagonal method or by operator splitting approach with off-diagonal terms, we were able to preserve unitarity to over 12 digits in our spin1 simulations and conservation of probability and energy to 10 digits accuracy.
