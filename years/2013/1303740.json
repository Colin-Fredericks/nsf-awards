 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tree rings are an important natural archive of past environments. Though these records have great value and potential, important details about rates and patterns of carbon storage in annual growth layers (tree rings) remain poorly understood. These gaps in knowledge concern the basic natural history of the tissue that forms wood. This research, led by scientists from the University of Arizona and Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc., aims to improve the scientific basis for the use of tree ring records by compiling data sets of when key tree growth processes start each year, the rate at which each proceeds and for how long, and how daily to seasonal variations in climate conditions relate to the timing, rate, and magnitude of each process. This will be the first such study in the Western US. The research team will collect data at four clusters of sites in Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona, all centered on existing flux tower facilities and including the major tree types used in dendroclimatology in this large region. They will then compare the tree growth data with air, stem and soil temperature, water availability, sapflow and other factors, as well as phenological events such as shoot extension and needle elongation. These data and comparisons are essential for improving forward models of tree ring growth control. The methods, based on and informed by sound process models of the climate control of tree ring formation, have the potential to improve robustness, extend generality, and better assess the biological validity of climate reconstructions based on tree rings. Such methods are also central to emerging Bayesian techniques of paleoclimate reconstruction, and to attempts to test reconstruction methodologies using synthetic proxy records.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include improved understanding of past climates and improved understanding and prediction of responses of wood growth in western forests to recent or possible future climates. The latter is a significant practical concern, as much of the carbon in forests is stored in wood, and the results of this research will further inform projections of carbon allocation and storage in response to climate change. The project will involve undergraduate researchers in field and lab work and the publication of results. The PIs will engage in outreach both directly through public talks and media interviews as well as through the University of Arizona Extension Service.",

There are important gaps both in the scientific basis for the use of tree rings as natural archives of past environments and in understanding the rates and patterns of carbon storage in wood each year in relation to climate variation. These gaps concern the basic natural history of the tissue that forms tree rings and hence wood, the vascular cambium (called just &ldquo;the cambium&rdquo; from here on). In particular, we know little about the seasonal timing of the activity of the cambium, especially when compared to our knowledge of the timing of growth of the green parts of the tree such as needles or leaves.</p>\n<p>The cambium is a layer of basic plant cells a few cells thick that covers the tree just under the bark. &nbsp;It produces wood cells by division (making new cells), expansion (cells getting fatter) and differentiation (building complex cell walls that serve both plumbing and structural strength needs). When this is complete, the wood cells die but stay in place. This process is called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">xylogenesis </span>(&ldquo;making wood&rdquo;). If the whole process closes down at the end of a growing season and starts again the next spring, an annual growth layer, or &ldquo;tree ring&rdquo; will be visible inside the cambium and bark. The duration and rate of each of the three steps of xylogenesis determine the size and internal structure of the tree rings used to study past climate variability, for example, droughts or the intensity of the Mexican monsoon. Although much is known about the metabolism (breathing in and out) of forests and their overall amount of growth, much less is known, especially in dry regions, about the seasonal timing of the three stages of xylogenesis and the links between them and environmental limits and seasonal signals such as daylength, temperature and availability of water. We focus on the Western USA, where strong variations in climate have major implications for important sectors of the economy and of society as seen in recent multi-year droughts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Our approach</strong>. We have compiled data on the timing of xylogenesis and its links to environment in four areas from southern Arizona to Wyoming, ranging from semi-arid mixed conifer forest to subalpine forests. At each location we have taken weekly microcores (&ldquo;biopsies&rdquo;) from sample trees of the main tree species found there, totaling almost 9000 samples (see Image 1), and used them to measure the timing of the stages of xylogenesis by microscopic analysis (see Image 2). This was done in three growing seasons, 2014, 2015 and 2016 thus capturing these years&rsquo; different seasonal patterns. The four areas were chosen because measurements of forest metabolism, climate and hydrology are available from the work of other scientists. In the three study years we added direct recording of leaf and shoot growth.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Main results</strong>. Our combination of three years&rsquo; direct observation of primary (leaf and shoot) and secondary (xylogenesis) growth, meteorological, and ecosystem metabolism variables along the almost 700-mile-long transect represents an invaluable resource for understanding of the formation of an important natural archive of climate (tree rings) as well as of the mechanisms controlling a key component of the terrestrial carbon cycle (wood). We continue to collate and analyze these data in order to estimate timing of xylogenesis as mentioned at the beginning of this report.</p>\n<p>For example, 2014 in southern Arizona provided a &ldquo;natural experiment&rdquo; because more rain fell in the first few days of the summer monsoon (starting July 5) than in the previous six months (see Image 3). The severe drought conditions of May and June 2014 forced a near-halt in cell division and expansion. The sudden start of July monsoon rain was followed within days by a restart of cell division and expansion, leaving a &ldquo;false ring&rdquo; in the structure of that year&rsquo;s ring (Image 3). We are working to &ldquo;put numbers on&rdquo; the conditions needed for these transitions. We expect this to enable the use of such &ldquo;false rings&rdquo; in estimating pre-monsoon droughts in this region back for many centuries, thus placing recent conditions in a longer-term context and informing expectations for future droughts.</p>\n<p>We can also identify when each cell in a tree ring was expanding and then forming its thicker cell walls. We show that if we measure only the expansion of the tree trunk over a season, or the width of the tree ring, we risk ignoring the great part of cell wall formation that happens after division and expansion have ended. This has important implications for getting the full picture of the impact of climate variation on tree and forest growth</p>\n<p><strong>Undergraduate students</strong> have been involved in this project throughout, providing a unique experience of laboratory and field research.
