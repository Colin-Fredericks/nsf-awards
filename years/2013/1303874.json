 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global environmental change is  an issue of major concern for Arctic communities but there is little understanding of how these factors mediate longer-term processes of social and cultural change.  This dissertation research project proposes to improve our understanding of the potential social and cultural impacts of environmental change in the Arctic by relating short-term environmental variability to different social and economic outcomes at the household level.  To explore these relationships, observational and weather station data on short-term climate variability, on seasonal and daily scales, will be used to analyze variation in the success rates of hunting activities and in household expenditures for store food.  These patterns will be further explored by examining their articulation with different strategies of engagement with the subsistence and cash economies, country food-sharing networks, and household food security.  The project will gather both qualitative and qualitative data and has the potential to increase our insights into how rapid environmental change is affecting social and cultural change.",

To achieve this, household food security data will be examined in light of community food sharing network properties as well as household-level attributes such as income and harvest production. Secondly, this research will investigate the relationship between household socio-economic characteristics and harvest production levels; including the effect of environmental variability (specifically seasonal conditions) on household production and food security.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This research will address social and economic issues of particular relevance for the far North by developing a quantitative understanding of the role of subsistence activities in Inuit food security and of the role of traditional sharing in wealth redistribution. This research will also provide new insights into long-standing theoretical questions in anthropology concerning the economic and social functions of food sharing by taking advantage of recent developments in statistical methods for social network analysis. At a local level, the objective of this research is to provide useful information for local community leaders regarding the current levels of food insecurity and their causes in the community.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fieldwork for this research was completed by the co-PI over a period of 12 months of participant observation in an Inuit community in Nunavik, Canada. During this period, 110 Inuit households in the study community (75%) responded to a questionnaire concerning household economics, food security, subsistence harvesting, and traditional (&ldquo;country&rdquo;) food sharing. Additionally, a small sample of focal households were interviewed about their subsistence harvesting and country food sharing activities on a bi-weekly basis over the course of 9 months. In total, 255 harvesting events and 825 instances of sharing were recorded. Meteorological data were gathered from local Environment Canada weather stations. In addition, the co-PI accompanied local subsistence harvesters on foraging trips and other land-based activities on just over 10% of days spent in the community; totaling over 35 days.
