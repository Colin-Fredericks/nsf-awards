 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Abstract***\r\n\r\nThe Science and Technology Center (STC) on Integrated Quantum Materials (C-IQM) is a partnership involving Harvard University, Howard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Boston Museum of Science, complemented by a large number of International collaborators. C-IQM is further strengthened and complemented by constant interactions with the \"College Network\" comprising partnership with investigators and teachers from Mount Holyoke, Olin and Wellesley Colleges in the Boston area, as well as with Gallaudet University and Prince George's Community College in the Washington D.C area. The focus of the Center is to use the recent discovery of quantum materials to transform signal processing and computation through an integrated approach that incorporates research, education, knowledge transfer, and increased diversity enhanced by international opportunities. These new quantum materials are changing the playing field and show promise to completely reshape modern technology.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the C-IQM is that it integrates synergistically three research areas at the forefront of condensed matter physics: (1) Graphene (G) with electrons that move as massless particles at a constant speed; (2) Topological Insulators (TI) where mobile surface electrons have spins fixed to the direction of motion; and (3) Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) Centers in diamond where a single spin stores a \"bit\" of quantum information. C-IQM takes advantage of the quantum phenomena displayed by these materials which, by persisting up to room temperature, lead to changes in the rules for signal processing and computation, ultimately opening the way for quantum electronics.  These quantum materials are ideally suited for integration into layered processor structures, in which Graphene and Topological Insulators control the flow of charge and spin, and NV-centers in diamond provide memory sites and optical input/output channels. Layering is natural for Graphene and Topological Insulators, which have two-dimensional electron systems on their surface. The C-IQM mission is to understand the unique electronic behavior of quantum materials and pursue an exciting opportunity to observe the exceedingly elusive Majorana fermion, a particle which is its own antiparticle. Quantum electronics developed in the Center will offer new approaches to signal processing, computing, and THz electronics. The broader impacts of the C-IQM are found in the strategic goal to develop a new class of quantum electronic devices and systems that will transform signal processing and computation. An equally important goal of C-IQM is to attract students to science and engineering, and to provide them with exciting opportunities to become future leaders. The Center's research and education programs bring together a diverse community to address these challenges by involving undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral associates, professors, industry and the public. The vision of the Center is clearly aligned with the national research and education strategic priorities.",
