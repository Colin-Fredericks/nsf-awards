 "awd_abstract_narration": "New camera technology is allowing avian ecologists to perform detailed studies of avian behavior, nesting strategies and predation in areas where it was previously impossible to gather data. Unfortunately, studies have shown mechanical triggers and a variety of sensors to be inadequate in capturing footage of small predators (e.g., snakes, rodents) or events in dense vegetation. Because of this, continuous camera recording is currently the most robust solution for avian monitoring, especially in ground nesting species. However, continuous video footage results in a data deluge, as monitoring enough nests to make biologically significant inferences results in massive amounts of data which is unclassifiable by humans alone.  This project will develop a citizen science project which combines volunteer computing, where people volunteer their computers to automatically analyze video with computer vision strategies, and crowd sourcing, where people volunteer their brain power by streaming the videos and reporting observations, to analyze over a hundred thousand of hours of avian nesting video.\r\n \r\nThis collaborative proposal will address the data deluge in avian research, where data acquisition rates are greatly outpacing the ability to process that data, by gathering, storing, and analyzing nest video at unprecedented scales for evaluating hypotheses about avian reproductive ecology and predator-prey interactions.  The team will develop computer vision techniques based on the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and speeded up robust features (SURF) algorithms and their variants  capable of identifying events involving animals with cryptic coloration in uncontrolled outdoor settings for this analysis.  In addition,they will use the nesting video to develop a large human annotated archival video resource for ecologists and computer vision researchers alike, generated using crowd sourced volunteer observations validated against each other and further refined by a scientific web portal for expert analysis of the volunteered responses. An enduring citizen science project combining crowd sourcing and volunteer computing to perform the analysis of the video and use it to foster public interest and involvement from K-12 classrooms, stimulating online education in STEM disciplines is also planned.",

Additionally, over 750 citizen scientists have watched over 58,000 hours of avian nesting video and are currently examining unmanned aerial systems and trail camera imagery.&nbsp; The project currently houses over 90,000 hours of video and over 3 million images, making it one of the largest collections of ecological data in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br />Observations made by project biologists and citizen scientists have been used to develop a large human annotated archival video resource for ecologists and computer vision researchers alike. Wildlife@Home made its first data release in 2015, making freely available 205 videos from the three species: Sharptailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) an indicator species which plays a role in determining the effect of North Dakota's oil development on the local wildlife, Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) a federally listed endangered species, and Piping Plover (Charadrius Melodus) a federally listed threatened species. Two additional species, Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) and Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), have been collected and are currently being reviewed by citizen and project scientists. The project has developed a searchable web interface which allows videos to be filtered by user and expert observations. As the biological research progresses, this will be opened to the public allowing researchers to search through the entire data set and download videos and human observations for future research in wildlife ecology and computer vision. This project also actively engaged young students, where in multiple years, Wildlife@Home was presented to students and used within North Dakota's K-12 classrooms in a collaboration with EduTech and in outreach programs in North Dakota and Manitoba.<br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Travis&nbsp;Desell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508815957709_PloverNestExchange--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508815957709_PloverNestExchange--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plover flying into nest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508815957709_PloverNestExchange--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plover flying into nest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nesting video captures a piping plover returning to its nest along the Missouri River in North Dakota.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plover flying into nest</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813554522_20170627_120751--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813554522_20170627_120751--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Camera installation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813554522_20170627_120751--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Camera installation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate researcher, Allicyn Nelson, installs a camera at a duck nest in North Dakota.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Camera installation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813804204_Sam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813804204_Sam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Oral Presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813804204_Sam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Oral Presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate researcher, Sam Krohn, presents research on using nest cameras to validate duck nest monitoring protocols at The Wildlife Society Conference in September 2017.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Oral Presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813209683_john--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813209683_john--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319700/1319700_10268478_1508813209683_john--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate student, John Palarski, presents nest camera research at the National Wildlife Society Conference in September 2017.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;Ellis-Felege</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
