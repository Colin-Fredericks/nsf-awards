 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the North American Cordillera, metamorphic core complexes are generally interpreted to record a single phase of large-magnitude Tertiary extension. However, growing evidence suggests many Cordilleran core complexes underwent Cretaceous deformation that fundamentally influenced their Tertiary tectonic development. In particular, mylonites in mid-Tertiary core complexes may have reactivated Late Cretaceous extensional shear zones. The primary goal of this project is to determine the relationship between Late Cretaceous deformation and Miocene core complex development in the Harcuvar and Buckskin-Rawhide Mountains in western Arizona. This study tests the hypothesis that lower plate shear zones in these core complexes are composite structures that initiated during Late Cretaceous extension. Research will evaluate the age and tectonic significance of lower plate fabrics and assess how Late Cretaceous structures influenced the location, geometry, and style of Miocene core complex extension. Research goals will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach involving geologic mapping, microstructural analysis, U-Pb geochronology, 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology, and Ti-in-quartz geothermometry. The Harcuvar and Buckskin-Rawhide core complexes are outstanding sites to address this topic because several portions of the lower plate are not overprinted by Miocene strain and because clear cross-cutting relationships are present between mylonitic and non-mylonitic lower plate rocks. In addition, these are classic localities where some of the widely accepted models of core complex formation were developed. \r\n\r\nResearch on core complexes continues to play a central role in our understanding of fundamental tectonic processes, including the origins and mechanics of large-magnitude extension and the long-term behavior of major fault zones. The anticipated results of this research will provide insight into many of these extensional processes. For example, the locations of core complexes and the low-angle geometry of core complex structures may have been strongly influenced by older tectonic activity. In addition, if core complex extension initiated during the Late Cretaceous, the slip rate and displacement on mid-Tertiary detachment faults may be lower than originally believed. The discovery of Late Cretaceous extension in core complexes would also have important implications for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Cordillera during the Laramide orogeny.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary scientific goal of this collaborative project was to determine the relationship between Laramide-age deformation and Miocene metamorphic core complex development in west Arizona.  Through detailed field, microstructural, and geo/thermochronologic studies we have demonstrated that Harcuvar, Buckskin-Rawhide, and Plomosa core complexes are composite structures that initiated during Late Cretaceous extension.  Some major findings from this study include the following: 1) Miocene shear zones exposed below these core complex detachment systems overprint amphibolite-facies, Late Cretaceous&ndash;early Tertiary-age mylonitic shear zones with the same geometry and sense of shear; 2) These older (Laramide) mylonitic fabrics are widespread across the west Arizona core complexes, whereas greenschist-facies Miocene fabrics are most localized near early Miocene plutons and within a 150&ndash;250 m thick zone below the detachment fault; 3) The Laramide fabrics are spatially associated with 74&ndash;65 Ma leucogranites that represent a regional pulse of lower crustal melting.  The no-cost-extension of this grant and subsequent transfer to Colorado State University allowed us to expand this research to the Plomosa Mountains, where was have discovered the northeasternmost exposures of the Orocopia Schist.  The presence of this Laramide subducted schist within an area that underwent Cretaceous crustal thickening points to major early Tertiary exhumation, which previously was not well recognized across the region.  Documenting the underplating of schist in this region also has important implications for the strength of the lithosphere during Laramide extension and the subduction geometry of the Farallon slab.  Most of our research related to this project will be completed by the end of the year.  To date we have published 10 abstracts and are currently preparing 2 manuscripts.\n\n \n\nThis project has supported a significant amount of undergraduate research.  Since the August 2013 start date, our research has involved 6 undergraduates at George Mason University, 4 undergraduates at Colgate University, and 1 undergraduate at Colorado State University.  Six of these undergraduates completed senior thesis projects, and 4 undergraduates who were involved in research are attending graduate school in a geoscience program.  This research has also involved 2 graduate students at Colorado State University, and altogether 5 female students and 2 minority male students have carried out research funded by this project.  The start of this project coincided with the initiation of a geology honors thesis program at George Mason University, and the 3 GMU theses that were supported by this grant played a major role in helping kick-start the program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin S Wong"
