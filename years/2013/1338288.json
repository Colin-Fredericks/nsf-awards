Participation in USENIX Security'13 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading work in the field. The support provided by this grant will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. USENIX Security'13 is scheduled to occur in Washington DC from August 14-16, 2013. The conference  consists of a three-day technical program, with numerous workshops co-located. Overall, the venue provides an outstanding opportunity for students to interact with leaders in their immediate field of study.",
