 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds David Fryxell of the University of California Santa Cruz to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.  The project title is \"Invasive Species in a Changing Climate: How Will Contemporary Trait Change Shape the Dynamics of Invaded Ecosystems?\" The host scientist is Dr. Kevin Simon.\r\n\r\nAs global temperatures rise freshwater organisms must adapt, and recent evidence suggests that rapid evolutionary adaptation can affect ecosystems in contemporary time. In order to understand the potential effects of contemporary thermal adaptation on freshwater ecosystems, this project focuses on understanding how an invasive fish, the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), has adapted to warm geothermal ponds, and how that thermal adaptation affects freshwater communities and ecosystems processes. This project is the first to explicitly test the ecological implications of contemporary thermal adaptation. It also addresses key issues facing New Zealand's environment (global warming and invasive species), and contributes novel insight to the nascent field of eco-evo dynamics (where evolution and ecology are interacting in contemporary time). \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow is working alongside several undergraduates; he hopes to share with them novel perspectives in biology. In addition, the Fellow is giving a talk at a local high school about the importance of evolution to conservation.",

While many freshwater taxa have high dispersal rates, landlocked fish do not, and must therefore adapt (physiologically or evolutionarily) to increased pond temperatures by changing their traits. Since fishes play a large role in shaping freshwater communities and ecosystems through cascading effects of predation on pond invertebrates and plants, any fish trait changes are likely to cause a modification to those interactions, thereby affecting ecosystem properties. Accordingly, I hypothesized that fish temperature adaptation will change fish traits, and that such trait changes will have drastic effects on pond ecosystems, potentially changing our predictions of how pond systems will be affected by global warming. I proposed using Gambusia affinis, one of the world\u00c6s worst invaders, taken from the unique thermal systems in northern New Zealand, to run an experimental pond mesocosm study testing how warming, fish invasion, and contemporary adaptation of fishes to temperature might each affect pond ecosystem outcome. Due to logistical limitations and time constraints the experiment was not performed. Instead, a focus was placed on 1) locating Gambusia populations in geothermal springs for future study, 2) the collection of Gambusia specimens to understand the genetic and morphological divergence among populations due in part to their thermal environment, 3) the development of a Gambusia nutrient excretion assay protocol , and 4) an introduction to flow injection analysis for measuring nutrients in water.\nThis project made significant advances towards the experiment\u00c6s execution. We now have candidate populations of Gambusia to test in our experimental arena, and simply require the resources to fund an array of experimental ponds. The analyses for the samples collected for both nutrient excretion and fish morphology and genetics, have not yet been cmpleted, but are currently in processing at the PI's home institution. However, both the host and the fellow have acquired considerable knowledge of the study system and the assays and analyses to be performed, and will seek funding to complete the project as originally proposed. The fellow is currently at his home institution using his new knowledge of water chemistry analysis to further develop ongoing studies in Santa Cruz. The host researcher will soon have water chemistry data which will inform us how fish excretion rates interact with temperature. The fellow will spend the upcoming season evaluating the morphological samples that he took while in New Zealand, and will begin genetic analyses in the near future. Through this work we have successfully developed a new study system which holds promise in yielding interesting information regarding the consequences of warming for fish and for aquatic ecosystems worldwide. We look forward to working together in the future and have walked away from this experience having gained significant knowledge and the background infortmation required to secure more funding to develop this study system. This NSF EAPSI catalyzed several new collaborations between U.S. and New Zealand institutions and researchers, and will result in major contributions to both the PI's dissertation and the host researcher's research programme. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Fryxell"
