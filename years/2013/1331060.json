Of particular interest in this project is understanding the ways that the youth may derive diverse linguistic, social, and information resources through their online networks. The research involves a comparative case study with two immigrant groups in the United States (adolescents of Chinese and Mexican origins) using both ethnographic and survey methods. We conducted a media use survey with 322 participants in a comprehensive high school. We also completed 52 home observations with 19 youth (10 of Mexican heritage, 9 of Chinese heritage) who participated in the survey.</p>\n<p>Focusing on 292 Mexican and Chinese participants in our survey analysis, we found that: (1) Adolescents who have spent more time living outside of the U.S. communicate more frequently with friends and family living <em>both</em> within and outside of the U.S., compared to adolescents who are born in the U.S. (2) Adolescents who spent more time living outside of the U.S. also communicate more often about personal topics (school work, school events, family life, interests or hobbies, jobs or career) with friends and family living both within and outside of the U.S., and this is particularly so for Chinese adolescents. For both Chinese and Mexican adolescents, frequency of communication with friends and family living outside of the U.S. was significantly related to perceptions of online social connectedness. Additionally, we found that increased engagement in personal communication topics with friends and family living outside of the U.S. was significantly related to online social connectedness among Chinese adolescents.</p>\n<p>In our qualitative analysis of the video-recorded data from case study observations, we identified several major themes that build on and extend our survey analysis regarding how the youth use digital media to cultivate particular resources and sense of social connectedness. One theme is the flow of information, emotional care, and material resources among families, particularly among Mexican youth. All of the youth use social media platforms to stay connected to family members who live in the U.S. and their natal countries. Among Mexican youth, these family ties are more expansive and involve multiple generations, sometimes involving more distant relatives and friends of family members, and spread out across their hometown in Mexico and multiple places in the U.S. The youth who came to the U.S. at a younger age would frequently read the Facebook posts of their relatives in Mexico even though they may not communicate directly with them. This frequent exposure to online messages from Mexico is facilitated by the youths&rsquo; sharing Facebook accounts with their mothers. Facebook posts and memes are mediums for family members to interact with each other and express feelings they have about their relationship, sometimes around cultural understandings and humor. Second, we found active cultivation of social, emotional, and academic resources with peers locally and transnationally, particularly among Chinese youth. While the Chinese participants are also connected to family members online, the numbers are much smaller (with the small families that are the result of the one-child policy in China). These youth focus predominantly on interacting with peers locally in the U.S. and their friends and former schoolmates in China through Chinese social media apps such as QQ, WeChat and Weibo which combine text, voice and video messaging and micro-blogging. Many of the youth expressed very close relationships with their friends in China, especially those who grew up and attended school together. We also found that a wide range of topics are discussed in the youths&rsquo; online conversations with their local immigrant peers, as they draw from news and events in their school and local environment, their personal life, as well as what they read/view on Chinese social media.
