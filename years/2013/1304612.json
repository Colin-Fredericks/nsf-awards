 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research comparing  the ethnomedical knowledge and language of the Chukchi and Naukan Yupik in eastern Siberia and the Central Alaskan Yup'ik in Alaska. The basic research project is to test basic anthropological epistemologies about the relationship between culture and language, and  seeks to understand the relationship between language and culture under conditions of linguistic and social change.  The researcher will test this idea by examining whether there are more similarities in medical beliefs between two societies speaking similar languages and sharing a deep historical root (Naukan Yupik and Central Alaskan Yup'ik), or between two societies speaking unrelated languages, but sharing the more recent influence of the dominant Russian culture (Naukan and Chukchi).\r\n \r\nThe comparison will focus on beliefs about the effects that plants have on the body, including species believed to have medicinal, nutritional and toxic properties.  The research will be based on standard anthropological methods, including semi-structured interviews in each region regarding uses of plants that affect health and explanatory models of health conditions, as well as field collection of relevant botanical species. \r\n\r\nThe researcher has built  strong relationships with the Yup'ik community and will include many Yup'ik students in the research through his position at the Kuskokwim Campus of the University of Alaska where Alaska Native students make up the majority of the student population.  This project will contribute much to our understanding of linguistic and cultural change, document ethnobotanical language and conceptualization and will contribute much to our understanding of the medicinal properties of Arctic plants that has potential global application.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      The project studied and compared traditional knowledge and uses of local plant species (for food, medicine and other purposes) in three societies of the Bering Strait region, the Naukan, Chukchi and Central Alaskan Yup'ik.  It examined the relative influences of sharing similar languages and a deep historical root (Naukan and Central Alaskan Yup'ik) vs. sharing the more recent influence of the dominant Russian culture (Naukan and Chukchi).  Our team of U.S. and Russian scholars, led by Dr. Kevin Jernigan of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, worked in ten native villages of the Beringian region from 2014-2022 and interviewed 178 people about ethnobotanical traditions. \n \nIntellectual Merit:\n    Project results have clarified patterns of similarity and differences in plant knowledge and uses in the Bering Strait region.  Although all three study cultures share many of the same ideas about the edibility of local plants species, the two Russian cultures (Naukan and Chukchi) are much more similar to each other than either are to Central Alaskan Yup'ik in terms of their medical ethnobotany.  The greater similarity between Naukan and Chukchi cultures can be explained both by intercultural borrowing and by the fact that both groups have adopted many Russian medicinal plant uses.  We have also noted many similarities and some key differences in ethnobotanical traditions between the inland reindeer herding and coastal sea mammal hunting Chukchi.  Although both groups use many of the same species for food and medicine, the latter group gathers a greater variety of species and shows some influence in naming and uses from contact with neighboring Naukan people.  We have found many similar ideas in all three cultures regarding the effects that plants have on the body, including how they should be prepared to be nutritious and beneficial.

These products have been used to create multimedia presentations that are available on the project website, and convey information about the naming, gathering and use of culturally significant local plants.  Multimedia materials have also been shared with participating native villages.\n      Six scholarly articles have been published in respected anthropological and ethnobotanical journals, including: Etudes Inuit Studies, Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine and Ethnobiology Letters.  The research has also contributed significant material to the publication of two books, Ethnobotany of the Central Alaskan Yup\u2019ik (2015) and Yungcautnguuq Nunam Qainga Tamarmi/The Entire Surface of the Land is Medicine: Edible and Medicinal Plants of Southwest Alaska (2021).\n      In addition to academic conference presentations, we have given eight public lectures at village community centers, in Alaska and Chukotka and created eight powerpoint lectures for classes, ranging from elementary school to college level.
