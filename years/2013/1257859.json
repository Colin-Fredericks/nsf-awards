 "awd_abstract_narration": "Male gametes are the most morphologically diverse cells in the animal kingdom, ranging from very simple cells to sperm with missing or multiple flagella and conjugated sperm that form cooperative units. To understand how this diversity evolved, it is necessary to investigate gamete morphology from an evolutionary developmental perspective, an approach widely applied to questions of embryonic development in whole organisms but that has never been applied to cellular morphogenesis. The proposed research will exploit the uniquely long spermatozoa in fruit flies of the genus Drosophila (up to 5.8 cm) to further investigate previously identified candidate genes for sperm length. Drosophila also present an especially elegant system due to their experimental and genetic tractability. These genes will be validated as potentially important in spermatogenesis, and their molecular evolution across the Drosophila lineage will be investigated. The research will also explore how these genes function during spermatogenesis using in vitro culture methods that allow cell development to be observed and manipulated in the controlled environment of a culture dish.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will greatly inform the scientific community's understanding of how gamete diversity has evolved at the developmental, molecular and cellular levels. Sperm are functionally important evolutionarily (affecting reproductive fitness and speciation), as well as biomedically and economically (informing fertility and in vitro fertilization practices in humans and domestic animals). Studies of the genetics of sperm form may also improve our understanding of general flagellar and ciliary development, including ciliopathies involved in human disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease).",
