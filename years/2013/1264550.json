 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to elucidate the behavior of self-propelled Janus particles near interfaces, using molecular dynamics to examine the countervailing influences of Brownian motion, solute concentration gradient, motion-induced fluid flow, and asymmetric force fields. The PI?s divide the main responsibilities according to their experimental and theoretical affiliations, but there are also collaborations with other laboratories in other universities for other techniques (e.g. using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy). The research plan bridges the gap between atomic-level simulations and colloidal-scale modeling and is very innovative and challenging. The results of such an investigation should have broad applications in mixing, assembling, and transport of particles in complex fluids and microfluidic devices.\r\nThe broader impacts on potential development of active materials in the formulation and directed self-assembly of designer materials, and the use of self-propelled particles in lab-on-a-chip type devices for cargo and drug delivery are very good as is the potential impact of their outreach to underrepresented college-level students.",
