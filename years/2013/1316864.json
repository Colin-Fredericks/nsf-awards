 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Stephanie Tong of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) at National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei, Taiwan.  The project title is \"Model-based Tracking Control Design for Accurate Shake Table Response.\" The host scientist is Dr. Keh-Chyuan Tsai.\r\n\r\nShake table testing is an effective method for evaluating the response of structures under dynamic loading, particularly earthquake excitations. To take full advantage of shake table testing, tracking control algorithms are applied for more accurate reproduction of earthquake ground accelerations. Realization of an appropriate tracking control algorithm will ensure that the actual shake table response matches the commanded shake table response. The project accomplishes this through the development of a model that captures the dynamics of the system driving the multiple shake table system at the NCREE laboratory and formulating tracking control schemes to ensure robust tracking control. Compensation for tracking error of the system will be provided by feedforward controllers, which control the system through an adjusted command anticipating the system behavior, and feedback controllers, which control the system by correcting the accumulated error. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, appropriate tracking control strategies secured for the NCREE shake table will ultimately advance modern control design by allowing other shake table users to obtain more meaningful testing results for improved structural control methods. The procedure to develop the tracking control will be shared so that perhaps other facilities with similar testing equipment can apply the same concepts in improving their tracking control. Upon return to the home institution, the fellow will give a seminar describing both the scholastic and cultural experience.",
