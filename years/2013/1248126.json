 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the development of carbon nanotube ultrafiltration (CNT-UF) membranes with high flux and uniform pore size. Carbon nanotubes are known to enhance flux in membranes for water and gas applications. Initial studies have shown that we can produce membranes with higher flux and better selectivity than commercial UF membranes. It is anticipated that the CNT-UF membranes developed in this project will have significantly higher flux than current commercial membranes, achieve good natural organic matter rejection, and have excellent chemical resistance.  This project enables fabrication and optimization of high performance CNT-UF membranes.\r\n\t \r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that carbon nanotube ultrafiltration membranes with higher flux and improved rejection will result in energy and cost savings in a broad set of applications.   Applications include but are not limited to treatment of surface water for potable water production, pretreatment for seawater desalination using reverse osmosis, municipal and industrial wastewater reclamation and a variety of other industrial processes. More efficient desalination, water reclamation, and reuse will reduce water scarcity. Improved ultrafiltration technology will reduce strain on water resources and aid in securing a supply of fresh drinking water worldwide.",
