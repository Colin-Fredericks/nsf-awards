 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers are developing a cyber-infrastructure product that uses a Smartphone application in conjunction with a cloud-based counterpart to provide real-time information about people and places surrounding a user during the course of the day. This technology uses real-time semantic analysis and fuzzy logic to present the user with only the attributes of people and places that are of potential interest or benefit to the user. During the course of this project researchers plan to develop a framework capable of handling large volumes of short messages that can be processed in a short time and create a cloud-based infrastructure to perform real-time semantic profile matching to handle the workload created by all users registered with the network. Researchers also plan to design network architecture and protocols to facilitate the communication of potentially large amounts of data from multiple users with minimal interference in a relatively small spatial location.\r\n\r\nPeople often find themselves in large groups in both professional and social settings, for example, at conferences, shopping malls, airports, and sporting events. Several people in these groups might share similar professional, social, and/or extracurricular interests and such knowledge could be beneficial to all. For instance, a researcher could find a potential collaborator, a businessperson a potential client, a student a room-mate and so on. This technology has the potential to enable people from all walks of life to establish new, meaningful relationships with others in their vicinity, thereby potentially impacting the human networking paradigm in both the social and professional context.",
