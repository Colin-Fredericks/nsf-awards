 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing number of researchers are taking-up the many social and cultural challenges of transitioning toward global sustainability.  While rapid global warming and extreme weather are often at the forefront of these challenges there are many more, including reduction in poverty; managing migration; improving access to water, healthcare, and education worldwide; sustainable development of limited natural resources, etc.   These challenges, although global, are particularly acute in the Arctic, which is socially and culturally quite diverse.  In order to cross culturally negotiate these diverse sets of sustainability challenges, interdisciplinary teams of researchers must work together, as well as with local and non-local scholars and experts and variety of stakeholders and community members.  It is in this complex landscape of sustainability challenges, scholarship, socio-economic and cultural systems, and political geography that this project has the potential to inform future research methods and global solutions.  \r\n\r\nThis research project seeks to help develop interdisciplinary researcher, local scholar, stakeholder, and community member teams so that they can best work together within and across cultures and within and across challenges.  In addition the project will support these leadership teams as their network grows globally through web-based platforms.   The main goal of the project is to identify the key social and psychological characteristics, individually and collectively, that lead to community leaders that understand and are willing to invest in sustainability ideas and projects.   Support is given to the PI to develop and test a complex of social science research methods and tools, labeled the Sustainable Futures Protocols, by which the most optimal competencies for collaboration and coordination of actions for sustainability can be understood, measured, and, perhaps most importantly, achieved.  The cross cultural component of the research project will be the development and testing of the Sustainable Futures Protocol in Arctic, Caribbean, and USA communities.   Results from this work will provide a testing, teaching, and development tool for individuals and groups with regard to community leadership and optimal community dynamics for sustainability.  It will provide a guideline of skills that can be developed individually or at the community level in order facilitate decisions about a global sustainable future.",

Transdisciplinary research is an approach that expands on interdisciplinary research by connecting academics and students with communities to find collaborative solutions to social and environmental problems. Community participants in transdisciplinary research can include a variety of individuals and groups with wide-ranging expertise and vested community interests. It is often conducted through small group projects that may include a few students. What the Transdisciplinary Research Education Toolkit does is make these projects bigger and more effective, so that more students can participate and learn.

These are, a) the Sustainable Futures Protocol (SFP), which is an initial curriculum that serves as a transdisciplinary research teaching and learning tool, b) an assessment and monitoring tool called the Global Sustainability Inventory (GSI), and, c) an international cross-cultural network research collaboration tool called the Global Social Sustainability Hub (GSSH). In terms of their broader contribution to the sciences, an objective with the SFP is to help forward research on the optimization of collaborative learning, including that in the fields of team science, leadership development, knowledge management, and transdisciplinary research.

While the project was based out of George Mason University, collaborative research and peer review included, among others, colleagues at Howard University, Old Dominion University, MIT and Columbia University. Inputs to design and testing were generated from collaborative work with various cultures including the Inuit of Nunavut and Nunatsiavut, the Maya of Guatemala, and the small island Caribbean cultures in the West Indies.
