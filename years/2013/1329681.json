 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a distributed algorithmic framework, supported by a highly fault-tolerant software system, for executing critical transmission-level operations of the North American power grid using gigantic volumes of Synchrophasor data. As the number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) increases to more than thousands in the next 4-5 years, it is rather intuitive that the current state-of-the-art centralized communication and information processing architecture of Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) will no longer be sustainable under such data-explosion, and a completely distributed cyber-physical architecture will need to be developed. The North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) is currently addressing this architectural aspect by developing new communication and computing protocols through NASPI-net and Phasor Gateway. However, very little attention has been paid so far to perhaps the most critical consequence of this envisioned distributed architecture \"namely\", distributed algorithms, and their relevant middleware. Our primary task, therefore, will be to develop parallel computational methods for solving real-time wide-area monitoring and control problems with analytical investigation of their stability, convergence and robustness properties, followed by their implementation and testing against extraneous malicious attacks using our WAMS-RTDS testbed at NC State. In particular, we will address three critical research problems \"namely\" distributed wide-area oscillation monitoring, transient stability assessment, and voltage stability monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research will be in establishing an extremely timely application area of the PMU technology through its integration with distributed computing and optimal control. It will illustrate how ideas from advanced ideas from numerical methods and distributed optimization can be combined into power system monitoring and control applications, and how they can be implemented via fault-tolerant computing to maintain grid stability in face of catastrophic cyber and physical disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project will be in providing a much-needed application of CPS engineering  to advance emerging research on PMU-integrated next-generation smart grids. Research results will be broadcast through journal publications, jointly organized graduate courses between NC State and University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, conference tutorials and workshops. Undergraduate research for minority engineering students will be promoted via the FREEDM Systems Center, summer internships via Information Trust Institute (UIUC) and RENCI, and middle/high-school student mentoring through the NCSU Science House program.",
