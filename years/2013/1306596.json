 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Catherine J. Murphy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a project focusing on the nanoparticle-biology interface.  Gold nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes are being developed as \"gold standards\" for the field.  The thermodynamics, kinetics, geometry and cooperativity of protein-nanoparticle binding are revealed by numerous spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods.  The major hypothesis to be tested is that the underlying surface chemistry of the nanoparticles dictates the final biological behavior of the entire ensemble.  LeChatelier's Principle, familiar from general chemistry, is being tested on the nanoscale in the context of gold nanoparticle-protein interactions, since light absorption by the nanoparticles leads to heating, which in turn can lead to either stronger or weaker binding depending on the enthalpies of the interactions.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental work at the interface of nanoparticles and biological molecules is to enable future applications and best practices in the area of nanobiotechnology.  The applications include photothermal destruction of pathogenic or cancerous cells; improved drug delivery vehicles based on nanoparticles;  and improved sensors for molecular diagnostics. Graduate students and undergraduate students trained in the laboratory gain great transdisciplinary experience at the frontiers of science, including opportunities to explain their science to nonscientists.  The PI is developing educational modules about nanotechnology and interfacial chemistry for massive open online courses, freely available to the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGold nanoparticles have fascinating properties:  depending on their size and shape, they absorb and scatter different wavelengths of light.  They can heat up their environment when illuminated with the proper wavelengths of light.  These properties can be translated into applications such as chemical sensing, bioimaging, drug delivery and photothermal therapeutics.  In many of these applications, the gold nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids, and proteins in these fluids can overcoat the nanoparticles and ruin their function.  The overall scientific goal of this project was to understand gold nanoparticle-protein interactions as a function of the initial surface chemistry of the nanoparticle, and as a function of protein properties.  This understanding may lead to predictions about the fate of these nanoparticles in biological systems.  One major finding is that nanoparticle net charge does not predict protein-nanoparticle interactions:  for instance, some positively-charged nanoparticles caused a particular protein to uncontrollably aggregate, but different positively-charged nanoparticles caused that same protein to face \"feet down\" on the nanoparticle surface.  Other surface treatments of nanoparticles caused that protein to go \"head down\" on the nanoparticle surface.  Control of how proteins are displayed on small curved surfaces is a key enabler of controlling nanoparticle fate, transport, and downstream effects on biological systems.  These experiments have led to new measurement techniques for protein-nanoparticle interactions, and to improved synthesis methods to make the nanoparticles.  On the educational side, both undergraduate and graduate students received multidisciplinary training in chemistry, biochemistry, materials science and nanotechnology synthesis and methods.  Graduate students learned how to mentor undergraduates in the laboratory.   Non-science students were \"participant-observers\" in the lab: these students majoring in art, dance, music, etc. shadowed the science students in the lab, and produced their own works of art in their discipline at the end of the time in the lab.  The science students received direct training in how to communicate what they do to intelligent people who are not scientists via this program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Catherine J Murphy"
