 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research grant investigates new optimization models for determining resource allocation decisions of law enforcement to interdict illegal drug networks.  These decisions focus on scheduling the activities of law enforcement in order to successfully monitor, target, and arrest criminals in an illegal drug network.  These decisions will be modeled using a novel dynamic interdiction framework and a Markov Decision Process framework.  The proposed models specifically incorporate the need to balance intelligence operations, which help to identify new criminals and build cases against known high-ranking criminals, and physical interdictions, which remove criminals from the network.   Specialized constraint programming-based optimization algorithms will be proposed and integrated into traditional integer programming techniques in order to exploit the structure of the scheduling decisions associated with identifying, targeting, and arresting criminals throughout the network to solve the proposed models.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide tools that help to better understand how to utilize scarce law enforcement resources to mitigate illegal drug trafficking.  This includes a better understanding of: (i) how to utilize resources of national agencies (e.g., the Drug Enforcement Agency) across various cities in partnering with local law enforcement,  (ii) how to best diversify the portfolio of criminals that are currently under surveillance by law enforcement, and (iii) how the flow of information between criminals impacts interdiction efforts.   The results of this policy-driven analysis will be shared with practitioners through collaborations with local law enforcement agencies.  The project will engage freshmen engineering students in cutting-edge research and develop their high-performance computing skills by implementing the specialized algorithms on supercomputing resources capable of exploiting decomposition-based solution approaches.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of this research are novel analytical models and algorithms for effective governmental resource allocation to mitigate illegal drug trafficking operations.  Preliminary models and analysis focused on allocating city-level resources (for example, police officers) to decrease the flow of illegal drugs into a particular city; this research focused on prescriptive optimization methods that were capable of proving insights into efforts against regional (multi-city) trafficking efforts.   The specific analytical capabilities created include:  (i) new hybrid constraint and integer programming algorithms capable of planning dynamic law enforcement operations across large cities to disrupt illegal drug trafficking networks, (ii) models and strong reformulation techniques to address the interdiction of regional drug trafficking operations that have both an information (or boss) network and a physical flow network, (iii) simulation approaches to evaluate the impact of different governmental efforts (e.g., incarcerating versus rehabilitating drug users) on illegal drug trafficking, and (iv) a framework to evaluate the tradeoffs between interdictions (e.g., arrests) and intelligence operations (e.g., performing surveillance on a known criminal).   \n\nThis research has contributed directly to the field of Operations Research (OR) by creating new algorithmic approaches to solve interdiction models that capture the unique aspects of city and regional drug trafficking networks that are orders of magnitude faster than approaches using commercial software.  For example, the reformulation technique for interdicting layered information and drug flow networks can solve problems with over 2,500 criminals while traditional approaches struggled on problems with 200 criminals.  In addition, these approaches are general enough to also be applied to analyzing cyber vulnerabilities of supply chain and infrastructure networks.   Undergraduate, Master?s, and PhD students were given an opportunity to apply prescriptive optimization approaches to an important area of public policy. \n\nThe results of this research provided insights into effective policies for governmental operations against illegal drug trafficking including:  (1) the effectiveness of focusing on the rehabilitation of drug users depends on a proper investment into law enforcement to identify users that are candidates for rehabilitation, (2)  under tight budget restrictions, it is better for regional (e.g., state or federal) to partner with city-level enforcement and focus on eliminating drug dealers, warehouses, and manufacturers within the cities, and (3) law enforcement should maintain a proper portfolio of criminals that are under surveillance while also diversifying their approaches to a particular type of criminal (i.e., not every drug dealer should be immediately arrested but some of them will be).
