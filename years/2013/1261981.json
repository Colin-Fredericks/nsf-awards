 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the University of Houston has established an excellent reputation in the field of nanotechnology by developing and refining techniques in the areas of nanofabrication, nanomagnetics, biosensors, nanocomposites, nanoscale filtration, and self-assembly. To draw on this collective expertise and experience, the 2013-2015 REU Site will be a themed \"Innovations in Nanotechnology\" program.  The 2013-2015 program will draw exclusively on the strengths of the interdisciplinary nanotechnology research being conducted across various departments of the Cullen College of Engineering, including Chemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The research climate for nanotechnology-related research in the Cullen College of Engineering is one of innovation and interdisciplinary cooperation, and is fueled by nationally-funded research programs supported by the National Science Foundation.  Student participants in the UH \"Innovations in Nanotechnology\" REU program will be afforded the opportunity to conduct research under nationally recognized experts in the field of nanotechnology. Students who are under-represented in the field of engineering on the basis of their ethnicity or gender, as well as students from Hispanic and African-American serving institutions will be recruited for participation.  The students who participate in our REU program are likely to pursue graduate education to further their interests in research, enhancing the diversity and number of research oriented technological leaders, and helping to fill our nation's need to establish and maintain a diverse, technological workforce.  The REU Site at the University of Houston is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation.",
