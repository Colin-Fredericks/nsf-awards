 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will adapt a photonics based signal processor to propel applications in extreme bandwidth spread-spectrum wireless communications.  The signal processor prototype known as the spatial spectral holographic (S2H) extreme bandwidth analyzer / correlator (EBAC) will function as a correlating receiver for low probability of intercept (covert) and interference immune spread-spectrum communications in any radio frequency/millimeter wave (RF/MMW) band. The Phase I effort proof of concept demonstrations showed correlation and demodulation of >4 GHz bandwidth signals with processing gain exceeding 40 dB.  The Phase II project will demonstrate continuous transmission signal generation and receiver processing prototype hardware with the ability to demodulate extreme instantaneous bandwidth up to 20 GHz spread-spectrum communications signals with long duration spreading waveforms up to 1 ms, with high data rates (1-1,000 Mb/s), and flexible frequency coverage exceeding 40 GHz.  For particular intensive signal processing functions such as spectral analysis and correlation the S2H EBAC analog signal processor demonstrates higher performance and power efficiency than traditional digital signal processing.  The intellectual merit of this project is in the advancement of the core technology and application to new real-world applications. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project include opportunities for major academic and commercial developments in communication technology, spectrum analysis, and spectrum enforcement with wide operating bandwidths from 0.5-40 GHz IBW. Initial commercial market would be for spectrum analysis systems with a customer base in electro-magnetic environment testing, tactical DoD next-generation wideband passive surveillance systems, law enforcement surveillance, and intelligence community spectrum sensing. In wireless communications, this technology has the potential extend the reach of spread spectrum communications to new operational paradigms.  Beyond communications, commercial applications include test and measurement systems, magnetic resonance imaging, weather radar, earth mapping, navigation, and spectrum use enforcement (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S.).  The enabling technology has commercial, military and intelligence community benefits in the form of geo-location, direction finding, data selection and filtering, navigation, and imaging.  With the collaboration with our university partner on this project, we will also support unique applications focused research experience opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in STEM fields.",

Furthermore, new RF over fiber optical cable as an analog stable relays was advanced, and a new approach using a free space MMW relays. \nNew Crystal Material Development and Characterization for Increased Sensitivity\n\nS2 began researching improved material compositions with higher frequency resolution and sensitivity.  The typical resolution bandwidth is 20-100 kHz, which sets the sensitivity depending on the crystal.  A new crystal was identified which now offers increased resolution to the ~1 kHz level and thus increased sensitivity.  The crystal also has enhanced persistence ability when magnetic fields are applied, resulting in enhanced signal integration over seconds as opposed to 10 ms.  To reach potentially sub-kHz resolution, S2 has investigated two enabling technologies, 1) an ultrastable laser technology, with Hz-level linewidths with ultra-low drift (&lt; Hz/s) and 2) a cryo cooler that reaches &lt;1K temperatures, rather than at 3K, which also makes the crystal spectral resolution better.\nSize, Weight, and Power Reduction\n\nPrevious generations of the S2-EBAC have incorporated large free-space optics platters for launching beams into the cold crystal. S2 has developed a very compact beam launching system that relies on less optics to achieve proper beam overlap and low scatter. The design relies on a counter-propagating programming beam and advanced beam steering for the Read and Reference beams. This method should be simple to align, and is robust against mechanical perturbations, while reducing the size and weight of the optics platter.\nTDoA based geolocation using S2 crystals for analog correlation\n\nThe use of crystals for wideband analog RF signal correlation was advanced over 20 GHz of bandwidth, and then pushed to complex RF waveforms.  To then propel this to geolocation systems, we used wideband RF antennas and set modest baselines of ~10 m with fiber.  Higher precision geolocation results come from longer antenna spacing as well as more antennas, better antenna geometry, and SNR and BW of the signals.  We then pushed to longer antenna baselines of ~1 km using RF on laser light transmitted from the antenna to the EBAC via phase stable fiber optical cable.\nFree-space Analog Millimeter Wave (MMW) Relays and Concepts of Operation\n\nWe also successfully developed and implemented phase stable, free-space analog MMW relays to show an alternative to using long fiber optical cables.  This technology also supports the S2-EBAC TDoA geolocation abilities by eliminating multi-km fiber spools that are large prohibitive to deploy in many tactical environments.  We also investigated using tethered drone systems to integrate the RF sensing antennas with these analog relays for advanced deployment capabilities. Tethered drones are useful as a portable mast system with ~250 ft height.\nRF Chirp Generation\n\nSignificant advancements were made to the RF chirp generation components responsible for producing wide optical bandwidth waveforms.  One use of these waveforms is for the S2 Readout, used to scan out the absorption profile of the S2 crystal materials, while other applications are programming S2 crystals, as well as optical signals for LADAR/LIDAR and other scientific applications.  On this effort, the bandwidth of the optical chirp was extended to 36 GHz of chirped coverage, over any duration from 10 us to 100 ms.  This wideband chirp was also demonstrated in a W-Band system where full-band coverage of 75 ? 110 GHz was achieved in an EBAC system that required 35 GHz coverage.  Wider bandwidths to 64 GHz and 128 GHz were conceived and are also possible. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristian D Merkel"
