The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. \r\n\r\nA year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.",

Today the east coast of North America is a passive continental margin; that is, the edge of continent that lies in the middle of a tectonic plate. Approximately 200 million years ago, however, this region was on a plate boundary, as the supercontinent Pangea broke apart and the Atlantic Ocean began to form. This process of continental rifting - in which continents break apart to form new ocean basins - is a fundamental component of plate tectonic theory; however, many fundamental unanswered questions about this process remain. For example, what causes continental rifting? Why do some continental rifts exhibit large amounts of volcanism, indicating melting of the mantle, while other continental rifts are magma-poor? What controls the deep structure of the crust and mantle lithosphere across a rifted margins, and what physical processes control that structure? What processes have affected the structure of the passive margin through time as it evolved after the rifting event? Why do some aspects of the eastern North American margin - including the presence of relatively young (about 45 million years old) volcanic rocks in Virginia and evidence for relatively recent (tens of millions of years) rejuvenation of ancient Appalachian Mountain topography - suggest that there are active tectonic processes affecting the passive margin today, even though it is far away from a plate boundary? The ENAM CSE project was designed to collect a seismic dataset that would allow the scientific community to address these fundamental unsolved problems. We collected a suite of seismic data both onshore (in North Carolina and Virginia) and offshore (off the coast of North Carolina). The dataset was designed to enable the imaging of the structure of the crust and mantle over a range of spatial scales. Offshore, we deployed a set of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) to measure both natural earthquakes from all over the world, as well as from airguns fired from ships, which generate acoustic waves that then propagate through the Earth. We also deployed seismometers on land that also measured both natural earthquakes and manmade sources (from airguns fired on ships, as well as controlled explosions on land). Data from this project were archived at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology data center, as well as the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics data center, and made immediately available to scientists as well as to the general public. This dataset will be used by many scientists to study the structure of the ENAM passive continental margin and to understand the fundamental Earth processes that accompany continental rifting.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maureen&nbsp;D&nbsp;Long</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347310/1347310_10265524_1478008803144_enam_cse_map--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347310/1347310_10265524_1478008803144_enam_cse_map--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of the ENAM CSE.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347310/1347310_10265524_1478008803144_enam_cse_map--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the ENAM CSE.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This map shows the data collection plan for the ENAM CSE.
