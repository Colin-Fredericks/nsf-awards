They will present scientific findings at the event. The early career scientists will be selected by the conference organization committee following an open call for applications.  The conference theme is broad; the support will focus on topics dealing with regional problems in Asia-Pacific rim e.g. climate change, atmospheric physics and chemistry, extreme events. The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for the early career scientist to gain new ideas and knowledge from the talks and presentations, which would be helpful for their career development and scientific pursuits. This award is co-funded by NSF International Science and Engineering section, Office of International and Integrative Activities.",
