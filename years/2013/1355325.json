The CPS PI meeting is the flagship event for the NSF CPS program.  It is conducted annually, and provides an opportunity for all CPS PIs and co-PIs to interact with NSF, other government agencies, and industry.  This particular award is to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will facilitate travel for the PIs and co-PIs of several CPS projects that are nearing completing.  The participation of these PIs in the meeting will be of great benefit to NSF and the broader CPS community, as they will be able to describe the successes of the most mature projects in the CPS portfolio, including recent science and technology breakthroughs as well as the broader impacts that are emerging.",
