 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative low cost approach to reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSC). RBSC is a preferred material for mechanical seals, which are critical, costly components in many major manufacturing lines. The high cost of RBSC limits its use in favor of cheaper, shorter lived materials. A microwave heating process, combined with lower cost raw materials addresses RBSC cost issues.  Phase I research identified a process range for producing RBSC with flexural strength above the industry average. The Phase II research will yield reliably high strength RBSC.  The key objective for Phase II is optimization of all-carbon preform formation, and microwave infiltration methods, to fabricate prototype mechanical seals for industrial evaluation.  The new RBSC will be characterized according to mechanical seal industry approval specifications. Innovative forming processes including 3D printing will be studied for the ability to quickly form complex, custom, near net preforms for infiltration. The anticipated result is a commercially ready, lightweight, high strength RBSC that will be preferred for existing and new applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will include significant cost reductions for wear resistant applications. A low-cost, superior performance mechanical seal will improve efficiency, with fewer costly production shut-downs due to pump failures. RBSC provides a longer overall lifetime than tungsten carbide, graphite, or alumina parts, further reducing life cycle costs.  Mechanical seals cost on average $750 per inch of diameter, ranging up to 15\" across. This research will enable a 50% reduction in RBSC cost, developing a viable, high performance product, along with market demand.  Recent consolidation of major silicon carbide suppliers provides an opening in the market to support a new, independent RBSC source.  The RBSC process uses a greener microwave process, with time, energy and greenhouse gas reductions of 50 to 80%. The commercial demonstration of microwave RBSC product will provide a needed boost to encourage other manufacturers to uptake cleaner, efficient microwave processing.  The project also supports Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education through high school projects and at least four undergraduate engineering co-op students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProcesses for reliably fabricating new high performance ceramic material, CerSiC&trade;,  were developed in this Phase II project.  CerSiC&trade; is a reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSC) made by a novel method of infiltrating a carbon preform with liquid silicon.  This differs from traditional RBSC which uses silicon carbide preform infiltration.  The advantages of the CerSiC&trade; all-carbon preform method include higher mechanical strength at a lower cost.  In addition, finer grain structures can be produced for greater resolution of features.  Higher purity RBSC can readily be obtained for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSeveral methods were developed for forming CerSiC&trade; into near-net shapes including slip casting, pressing, and laminated object manufacturing (LOM).  LOM, an additive manufacturing method, holds great promise for complex CerSiC&trade; products.\n\nOne of the key innovations in this project was solving the challenges of carbon preform infiltration.  The infiltration is highly exothermic and typically causes cracking in the part.  Prior to Ceralink\u00c6s discoveries, the scientific community largely believed that it was not possible to use all-carbon preforms to fabricate RBSC.  The complex chemistry of the reaction was brought into control by studying and understanding the various parameters of the infiltration process.  For the first time, an inexpensive higher quality RBSC is commercially viable using carbon preforms.\n\nCerSiC&trade; has many potential applications including support materials for semiconductor processing, substrates for precision satellite mirrors, and wear resistance components such as mechanical pump seals.  CerSiC&trade; can be produced with various microstructures, including a fine grained material with higher strength than commercially available RBSC. \n\nThis project had important broader impacts by expanding Ceralink capabilities to serve our customer base.  Ceralink is a materials processing and testing service company.    Each of the CerSiC&trade; fabrication steps is applicable to our customers\u00c6 manufacturing process improvements.  Therefore, these capabilities served to grow Ceralink\u00c6s commercial technology reach.\n\nCeralink\u00c6s dedication to innovation includes educating and providing opportunities to future engineers and scientists.  A diverse group of undergraduate, community college, and high school students worked on various stages of the project.  Ceralink recognizes the importance of diversity in the workplace as invaluable to innovation. \n\nThis project was successful by applying innovation and resources to overcome the extreme technology challenges of new carbon-preform CerSiC&trade; materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shawn M Allan"
