 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to improve the quality of service and lifetime of real-time\r\nembedded systems, particularly those implemented on multi-core platforms. In\r\ncontrast with many other quality metrics, such as performance and power\r\nconsumption, reliability is difficult to accurately estimate because it is\r\ninfluenced by design decisions, environmental conditions, and process variation\r\nduring integrated circuit fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three main technical tasks.  (1) Develop a reliability\r\nmodeling and analysis framework that can efficiently and accurately determine\r\nthe impact of design and runtime management decisions on reliability.  (2)\r\nDevelop a reliability-driven resource management framework, which includes\r\nruntime algorithms for assignment and scheduling of real-time tasks to maximize\r\nsystem lifetime while keeping soft error rates low, and a lightweight technique\r\nto adaptively adjust the activation frequency of the algorithms (i.e.,\r\noverhead).  (3) Develop wear state monitoring techniques and data collection\r\ninfrastructure to enable the runtime refinement and validation of system-level\r\nreliability models that require long-term in-field system deployment.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will support the production of more\r\nreliable and/or less expensive electronic devices, enabling integrated\r\ncircuits, which are susceptible to wear due to lifetime fault processes to be\r\nused in special-purpose computers with strict reliability and performance\r\nrequirements.  In particular, this project aims to ease the use of multicore\r\nprocessors in high-reliability computing applications with deadlines, such as\r\nautomotive, multimedia, and health care applications.  These applications have\r\nhistorically seen slow adoption of multicore processors, despite their price,\r\nperformance, and power consumption benefits.  We believe this is partially due\r\nto gaps in knowledge of how to control and optimize reliability on such\r\nsystems, some of which this project will fill. The involvement of both industry\r\nresearchers and university students at the undergraduate and graduate level\r\nwill result in a broad dissemination of the research results.",

Both permanent failures and transient faults were considered. The project developed techniques to support the design of more reliable electronic devices, enabling integrated circuit use in processors with strict reliability and performance requirements, e.g., in automotive, multimedia, and health care applications. Three main research tasks were undertaken. The associated findings and outcomes are summarized below. The project was collaborative, with all three PIs contributing to all research tasks. This report includes work from all three collaborating universities.<br /><br />Task 1: Development of a reliability modeling and analysis tool that considers all major failure mechanisms and supports tradeoffs between accuracy and computation demands.<br /><br />Given two thermal profiles, the project developed a method of determining which will maximize lifetime reliability. Different task assignment and scheduling methods can lead to vastly different system wear rates and online resource management improves system reliability. <br /><br />Since system-level mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) can be computationally expensive, the project developed a method to determine the number Monte Carlo iterations required for high accuracy and a rapid analytical approach to calculate the MTTF due to transient faults for a processor executing a given workload.<br /><br />The project also developed novel methods of improving reliability in the presence of soft errors resulting from alpha particle emission by within-package contaminants packages such as solder. The most interesting thing about this class of errors is their strong dependence on position, which stands in contrast to the more commonly studied soft errors produced by high-energy neutrons. A key finding was that alpha particle dependent soft errors can vary from essentially zero to multiple failures per day per gigabyte of memory depending on die position for integrated circuits using within-package solder. This opens the possibility of reliability-aware floorplanning. The project developed a simulation tool enabling calculation of soft error rate as a function of die position and structure. This tool (AlphaPro) will be released for free use in research pending successful peer review.<br /><br />Task 2: Adaptive runtime resource management framework for reliability-driven assignment and scheduling of real-time tasks. This project developed a global model predictive controller-based approach based on the observation that temperature can be reduced by maximizing utilization. This technique is extremely effective at minimizing the peak temperature of multicore systems under soft real-time constraints. Using the approach improves lifetime reliability by at least 43%. The team also developed an optimization framework to maximize the system availability in the presence of lifetime and transient faults, which improves availability by up to 85% compared with existing techniques.<br /><br />Processor cores are sometimes grouped into high-performance (HP) and the low-power (LP) clusters. Cores within the same cluster share a power management state. The project determined that LP cores consume less power only when the workload is light and the core frequency is low. The team developed an on-line algorithm to maximize soft-error reliability subject to a lifetime reliability constraint. Experimental results from both a hardware platform and a simulator show that the proposed algorithm reduces fault rate by at least 30% compared to existing approaches.<br /><br />The project also considered the hardware platforms where central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) are integrated into one chip. The team found that a task's execution time on CPU significantly increases when executing on a different CPU core from the operating system. The project developed a hybrid framework to map tasks to CPU cores and manage dynamic core frequency scaling in order to improve soft-error reliability while satisfying a lifetime reliability constraint. Experimental results show that this framework results in CPUs and GPUs avoiding errors for 2 days and 42 days longer on average than existing approaches, respectively.<br /><br />Reserving computational resources and only allocating recoveries to failed tasks improves soft-error reliability in systems with both transient and permanent faults. The project developed a novel dynamic recovery strategy together with an online scheduling algorithm that reduces failure probability by at least 8% and by 73% on average compared to existing approaches. <br /><br />Task 3: Implementation of an infrastructure for runtime monitoring of integrated circuit wear state to support long-term reliability model validation and in-field adaptation. A testbed consisting of off-the-shelf embedded processors confirmed that it is possible to induce timing violations and observe wear over time without additional circuitry, changes to the underlying hardware, or difficult-to-obtain design data such as threshold voltage or critical paths. This approach can be implemented entirely in user space, making it possible for end users to monitor the wear progression on their systems in real time and to proactively avoid a voltage, frequency, and temperature combination that may result in timing violations. Such an online monitoring tool may be leveraged to predict the remaining lifetime of a system.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Dick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545258371098_dick-image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545258371098_dick-image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Soft error rate as a function of position\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545258371098_dick-image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Soft error rate as a function of position\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Alpha particle dependant soft error rate as a function of die position for region under one solder bump, illustrating very strong dependence of error rate on position.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sameer Sathe</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Dick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Soft error rate as a function of position</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259343093_hu-image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259343093_hu-image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Power consumption comparisons for high-performance and low-performance processor cores\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259343093_hu-image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Power consumption comparisons for high-performance and low-performance processor cores\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparisons of power consumptions of high-performance and low-performance cores as a function of utilization for several operating frequencies.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sharon Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Dick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Power consumption comparisons for high-performance and low-performance processor cores</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259576493_chantem-image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259576493_chantem-image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Measured changes in microcontroller failure rate with time\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1319784/1319784_10278924_1545259576493_chantem-image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Measured changes in microcontroller failure rate with time\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Measured crash rate as a function of time for several embedded microcontroller boards, demonstrating increasing crash rate due to lifetime wear processes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thidapat Chantem</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Dick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Measured changes in microcontroller failure rate with time</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
