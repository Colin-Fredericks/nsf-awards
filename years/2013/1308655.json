 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Mark Distefano from the University of Minnesota to develop methods to quantify and image the prenylome.  Overall levels of prenylation will be measured by metabolic labeling with alkyne- or azide-containing substrate analogues followed by click reaction with a fluorescent reagent and subsequent quantification via flow cytometry.  To selectively observe the localization of prenylated proteins such as K-Ras, alkyne- or azide-containing substrate analogues will be metabolically incorporated followed by click reaction with fluorescent probes and visualization via confocal microscopy.  FRET-based methods and a strategy involving proximity-induced amplification will also be investigated to increase visualization sensitivity and selectivity.  Results from the first objective will improve the understanding of how differences in prenylation levels correlate with various drug treatments and disease states.  Results from the second objective will help clarify how the activities of prenylated proteins are regulated via changes in their subcellular localization.\r\n\r\nProtein prenylation involves the attachment of a lipid group to a protein; several hundred of such proteins are present in human cells.  Prenylated proteins are involved in regulating many features of cellular behavior including growth and communication and a number of diseases require the participation of such proteins.  The focus of this proposal is to develop new methods to monitor the levels of prenylated proteins and track their location within cells.  If this can be accomplished, new approaches to combat an array of diseases ranging from cancer to aging may emerge.  This project will also be used as a vehicle to introduce a group of undergraduates to research by having them use the methods developed here to investigate protein prenylation in a wide variety of cell types and model organisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemical Approaches for Quantification and Visualization of the Prenylome\n\n \n\n \n\nProtein prenylation is a process that occurs in all cells except bacteria. In this process, a small chemical moiety (a prenyl group) is linked to specific proteins inside the cell that causes those proteins to associate with the cell membrane.  Once attached to the membrane, those proteins can interact with other proteins that are positioned on the outside surface of the cell; those interactions are critical since they allow information, in the form of signaling molecules, to be communicated to the inside of the cell.  Such information includes instructions for a cell to divide, change shape or develop into a more specialized cell.  Since prenylated proteins are so important to a cell, interfering with the process of prenylation can be used to selectively kill diseased or malfunctioning cells.  Similarly, changes in the amounts of these proteins within cells can change normal cell physiology and potentially cause various diseases.\n\n \n\nIn this project, we developed a number of synthetic analogs of natural prenyl groups that can be incorporated into prenylated proteins.  These synthetic molecules contain \"tags\" that allow us to be able to see them within cells (Figure 1, Left).  Using microscopy, we can visualize where these proteins are within cells (Figure 1, Center). Using a technique called flow cytometry, we can measure how bright each cells is which correlates with the amount of prenylated proteins present within a given cell (Figure 1, Right).  Finally, by breaking open the cells and separating the prenylated proteins, we can use the \"tags\" to identify specific prenylated proteins and study how their levels change in response to different drugs or different disease states.  Overall, this research has provided important insights into how cells function and chemical tools that can be used to identify new drug targets.\n\n \n\nThis research provided interdisciplinary training for three graduate students.  One of them is now working in the biotechnology industry, another is pursuing postdoctoral studies in biology and the third is working towards completing their Ph.D. Six undergraduates were also involved in this work.  Those students have either entered graduate school in chemistry (or related fields) or are working in the chemical industry.  Two high school students including an underrepresented minority student, were also supported by this grant.  They are both currently enrolled in college.  Beyond numerous scientific publications and presentations at scientific meetings, the results of this research have been described in several public forums including a local high school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Distefano"
