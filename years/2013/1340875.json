Without world-class network infrastructure, the ability of institutions to conduct world-class research is hindered and the competitiveness of the US is reduced.\r\n\r\nThe MARIA 100G project addresses a known bottleneck point in the NatCap network aggregation facility operated by Virginia Tech on behalf of the research and education community in Virginia, including the research institutions who are members of the Mid-Atlantic Research Infrastructure Alliance (MARIA). The project is upgrading the aggregation link to the Internet2 national research network, from a 2x5 gigabit per second capacity shared by all institutions in the commonwealth to a 100 gigabit per second capacity. The removal of the bottleneck paves the way for the unimpeded exchange of dramatically growing data sets in the course of scientific discovery.",
