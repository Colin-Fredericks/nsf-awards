Biomass generally has high moisture content and is usually dried before being utilized.  Nonetheless, there are a number of applications where ?wet? biomass can be useful.  For example, when biomass is burned with oxygen in a power plant and the resulting carbon dioxide is stored underground, the process leads to carbon negative power production. \r\n\r\nThis program seeks to gain knowledge of the physico-chemical processes associated with combustion of high-moisture content fuels.  Three types of biomass/water mixtures will be studied: alcohol/water solutions, algal suspensions, and biomass solubilized in water. The vaporization and combustion characteristics will be studied in single droplet experiments and in a spray combustor. Analytical models of two-component droplet vaporization and combustion will be used to understand and interpret results.\r\n\r\nThis work will provide fundamental data needed to support technologies for a sustainable approach to power generation with carbon capture and storage. The research will be an important educational tool, exposing our youth to novel approaches to renewable, sustainable technologies. In addition, an innovative, interdisciplinary experiential course on Energy and Environment will be developed.",
