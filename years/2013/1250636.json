 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravitational wave astrophysics is entering a new era of discovery and exploration, with first detections expected within the next few years with Advanced LIGO, the ground-based interferometer in the United States. One of the key missions of LIGO is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous relative to Earth's or the Sun's pull. Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about this force when black holes and neutron stars collide in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. This project has 2 main goals: (i) to calculate accurate waveforms that aid in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals and (ii) to develop the best, generic and model-independent framework to test Einstein's theory and search for anomalous deviations in gravitational wave data. \r\n\r\nThe research described above is creative and potentially transformative, constituting one of the first dedicated efforts to test Einstein's theory with gravitational waves, an essential step to exploit the full potential of gravitational wave detection. This type of research is also timely and relevant, in view of upcoming, advanced detectors and the dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics. The impact of gravitational waves signaling a systematic departure from Einstein's predictions is clearly breathtaking. But the lack of a departure from Einstein's theory would also constitute a huge step for Science, proving for once and for all that Einstein's theory is also valid in the most extreme gravitational scenarios. We also have an ambitious outreach plan that includes the organization of \"Celebrating Einstein\": an immersive art exhibit that incorporates gravitational waves sounds and simulations, orchestra and dance performances, and a scientific workshop. There will be accompanying talks for the public and lectures for local middle school students. Another outreach initiative is the creation of a \"Cosmic Caf\u00e9\" in Bozeman, Montana, that will reagularly organize activities such as Jeopardy-type contests about Physics.",
