 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2010, IODP exp. 327 launched series of experiments based on instrumentation placed in 6 boreholes (Holes 1026B, 1027C, 1301A, 1301B, 1362A, and 1362B) on and near the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JDFR). The experiments were designed to examine hydrological and biological processes in basaltic ocean crust. Major issues to be addressed include overall permeability, the magnitudes, velocity and directions of fluid, solute,and heat transport,constraints on the fluid storage properties of crust, determining how fluid reservoirs respond to seismic perturbations, and investigating the variability, diversity, and metabolism of resident microbial populations. This project will recover sensors and samplers in the instrumented boreholes(CORKs),access data and samples, collect biological incubators placed at depth within the boreholes, and seal the CORKs. All of these activities are needed for the completion of the JDFR experiments\r\n\r\nOnce the data and samples are retrieved, the PI's will develop new numerical models for the hydrology (permeability, thickness and extent of permeable zones, connectivity, direction of flow, and anisotropy) of ocean crust based on the results of flow tests. T sensors will enable thermal structure to be determined in conjunction with flow parameters. DNA will be analyzed via ?16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes as well as select full-length Sanger-style sequencing and gene fingerprinting techniques.? The PI's will look at diversity, shared species, emergence and disappearance of groups. Metagenomic work will be done on some samples.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts include training of 4 shipboard educators, with an emphasis on recruiting underrepresented groups for these positions, teacher workshops, and special training for undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs. Research team includes grads, undergrads, and post-docs.",

This study provided a framework through which we could gain a better understanding of the physical, chemical, geological and biological processes that occur within the rocky basalt of the deep subseafloor. To accomplish these goals, we used wellheads, or observatories, installed within boreholes drilled through the seafloor in the Northeast Pacific Ocean off of Vancouver Island that provided access to this environment. Our target was deep ocean crustal fluids that circulate within cracks and fissures of the basaltic rock. In previous research we injected a variety of physical and chemical tracers into the ocean crust via one borehole and, in the current project, we returned several years later in order to collect samples and data from five different boreholes. This work was the first to directly measure the hydrologic properties of the oceanic crust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sampling deep-ocean crustal fluids has required the development of specialized equipment capable of being deployed at the seafloor in order to pump fluids from up to hundreds of meters below the surface sediment. This equipment was primarily developed through the work of earlier projects, but improved upon during its deployment in support of this project. In addition to analyzing crustal fluids for injected tracers, the recovered samples had additional benefit for understanding the microbiology and biogeochemistry of the deep subseafloor biosphere, including how subseafloor water circulation affects the cycling of organic matter. Several characteristics of the deep subseafloor environment make it a useful analog for life on other planets. Initial biogeochemical evidence and the modelling of potential metabolisms suggested that this system is energy-starved, and is likely dominated by hydrogen, methane, sulfate, iron, and nitrate cycling. Our observations also revealed that it is also a reservoir of novel microbial and viral genetic diversity that can help to inform on the evolution of key metabolic pathways such as methane cycling and sulfate reduction thought to be important to Earth&rsquo;s early microbial inhabitants, and important to microorganisms inhabiting anaerobic habitats at present.
