 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research at the Intensity Frontier builds upon the development of High Intensity Accelerators and Storage Rings.  With the increase in circulating beam currents, particularly for positively charged beams, various effects such as the rise of electron clouds become increasingly challenging.  For example, the beam intensity in the Fermilab Main Injector is predicted to increase approximately four-fold for the Project-X upgrade, and electron cloud formation is expected to be a problem. The IIT group intends to measure in detail electron cloud formation in the presence of different materials and under varying beam conditions. The program of effort will involve design work to evolve the performance and variety of electron cloud measurement techniques, as well as to validate or improve electron cloud models used in numerical simulations by the scientific community.  The research will be performed collaboratively with experts at Fermilab and at Argonne National Laboratory.  Through this program, IIT is building a nascent graduate program in accelerator physics and materials research to support future accelerator development, with students involved in all aspects of the research, from hardware to modeling to numerical simulations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Accelerator Research on Electron Cloud Characterization\n\nParticle accelerators are major tools for research and discovery.   The accelerator complex at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) operates at the ?intensity frontier?.  In this regime, very high intensity particle beams are provided for experiments that need them; for example, those studying rarely interacting particles such as neutrinos.  As the number and density of particles in a beam increase, associated problems develop, such as the unwanted production of electrons at the beam pipe walls.  Seed electrons produced from ionization of background gas, for example, impact the beam chamber walls and produce emission of secondary electrons.  Upon repeated impact with the beam pipe material, the shower of secondary electrons can produce a cloud of electrons in the vacuum chamber whose electric field can act to disrupt the particle beam.  The number of secondary electrons produced in part depends on the Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) of the beam pipe material, and in part depends on the characteristics of the particle beam.\n\nThe goal of this research project was to determine the expected severity of electron cloud production when the beam intensity at Fermilab is increased through a series of machine upgrades, and to develop a strategy for mitigating electron cloud production.  The method to determine the severity of the problem was to study electron cloud production through a simulation of the operating accelerator.   The predicted electron cloud density was determined under different potential operation conditions, including different beam intensities, bunch lengths, and beam pipe material SEY values.   It was determined what SEY values are sufficiently low to control the electron cloud production at expected machine upgrade intensities.  The simulation results were productively compared to an observation of beam dynamics when the Recycler Ring experienced an electron cloud based beam instability.  The simulated build up of the electron cloud provided insight on how to control it by reducing the intensity at the leading edge of the beam.\n\nMitigation of the electron cloud is best done by having a beam pipe material with a low SEY.  It has been found that the SEY value of a material becomes lower over time upon exposure to the particle beam.  This only goes so far before the lowest possible value is reached.  An apparatus for measuring the SEY value of a material and its evolution in the particle beam environment was deployed.  It was used to find the lowest SEY that could be reached for the current beam pipe material in the Main Injector accelerator.  According to the simulation results, this SEY is likely not low enough at the expected higher intensities after the machine upgrade.  The SEY test stand was also used to test how the SEY can be improved using a coating of TiN on the beam pipe material.  This SEY may be low enough, but it is borderline, and new types of coatings are going to be tried out in the SEY test stand.\n\nThis research project resulted in a more detailed understanding of the expected electron cloud dynamics in the Fermilab accelerator complex once it is operating at higher beam intensities.  Another result was to gain familiarity with the way that the SEY of the beam pipe material evolves with time upon exposure to the particle beam, including the lowest value of SEY that may be expected, and also how certain coatings on that material will reduce the final SEY value.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda Spentzouris"
