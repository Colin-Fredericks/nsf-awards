 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whether bicycling or walking across roads, children must make decisions about whether gaps are large enough for safe crossing. This involves assessing how long it will take for the oncoming car to arrive in relation to how long it will take for them to cross the street. Past work suggests that gap decisions and crossing movements are less well coordinated in children than in adults. Children and adults choose the same size gaps, but children typically end up with less time to spare between themselves and the oncoming car. Tightly linking gap decisions and crossing movements may be particularly difficult when children are just beginning walk or bicycle across roads on their own. If so, we might expect developmental patterns to repeat themselves at different ages for pedestrian and cyclist road crossing. However, little is known about how pedestrian and cyclist road-crossing skills are related to each other because there have been no direct comparisons of the two skills.  This project examines children's use of visual information to guide selection and timing of motor behaviors.   The investigators will use large-screen, immersive pedestrian and bicycling simulators to safely and systematically compare how 6- to 12-year-old children select gaps and time their movement when walking vs. bicycling across intersections.\r\n\r\nThis work will provide new information about children's perceptual-motor development in the context of a real-world problem where the visual information (i.e., traffic) stays the same, but the mode of locomotion differs (i.e., walking vs. bicycling). This research will also contribute to our understanding of the risk factors for collisions involving children and motor vehicles, a significant public health problem. As such, this work will help lay the foundation for future intervention studies designed to reduce the risk of such collisions.",

Specifically, this project used virtual reality technology to safely and systematically examine the development of pedestrian and cyclist road-crossing skills across childhood and early adolescence. The basic task involved repeatedly crossing a single lane of virtual traffic in an immersive bicycling or pedestrian simulator without colliding with a vehicle (Figure 1). The traffic travelled at a typical residential speed of 25mph and included both crossable and uncrossable gaps.

We also observed steady improvement in children?s timing of entry relative to the lead car in the gap up to age 14. Coupled with their less precise timing of entry, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds? gap choices resulted in significantly less time to spare and more collisions than 14-year-olds and adults.

Younger children?s difficulties with timing their movement in particular resulted in 8-, 10-, and 12-year-old bicyclists having significantly less time to spare when they exited the roadway than the 14-year-old bicyclists.

Adult pairs were more discriminating in their gap choices than adult solo crossers, crossing fewer of the smaller gaps and more of the larger gaps. This pattern did not hold for 12-year-old pairs compared to 12-year-old solo crossers.
