 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes governing the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation within the \"comma head\" sector of extratropical cyclones remain poorly understood.  This sector of baroclinic storm systems is often the focus of hazardous winter weather including heavy snowfall, blizzards and ice storms that markedly impact transportation and other human activities.  This investigative team seeks to improve our understanding of precipitation substructures within this zone by addressing outstanding questions arising from the Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) field campaign, which was carried out during the winters of 2008-09 and 2009-10. Observations collected during PLOWS included extensive in-situ microphysical data gathered by the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft, high-resolution remote sampling of precipitation structures by the University of Wyoming Cloud Radar and Lidar carried aboard the C-130, complementary views from ground-based radars and profiling systems, and special serial rawinsonde launches.  Additional insights will be gained through high-resolution simulations suitable for comparison with a wide range of observed precipitation substructures. \r\n\r\nPlanned investigations will center on: (1) The nature and source of instability creating cloud top generating cells, including determination of updraft magnitudes, origins and role supercooled water in the generation and growth of ice particles near cloud top, ice particle concentrations within generating cells and associated precipitation plumes, and processes leading to the rather ubiquitous generating-cell structures observed during PLOWS; (2) the means by which potential instability is generated within zones characterized by deep upright elevated convection on the warmer side of comma-head regions, the relationship between the \"dry-slot\" upper-tropospheric airstream moving over warm-frontal surfaces, and determination of the role of synoptic-scale vertical motions accompanying frontogenesis in triggering release of this instability; (3) the origins of linear precipitation bands and their potential creation by synoptic-scale deformation acting upon descending ice particle plumes issued by elevated generating cells, as well as differing ice particle characteristics within and outside these bands; (4) the relationship of polarization radar signatures to measured in situ microphysical properties, and in particular determination of whether supercooled water or its effects (e.g., rimed particles) can be dependably detected via remote sensing; and (5) the nature of stratiform- vs. convective-cloud region flows with attention to fine scale wave features, frontal interfaces, their effects on microphysical processes, and their relationship to isentropic surfaces, shearing instability, and low-level fronts in the production of locally-enhanced precipitation rates.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this effort rests on full exploitation of the unique and extensive PLOWS project dataset to address longstanding questions concerning the nature and origins of precipitation within winter cyclones in more complete and definitive ways than has heretofore been possible.  Broader impacts of this research will include a carefully designed mix of undergraduate and graduate education and testing of improved operational strategies for remote sensing of winter weather systems hinging on emerging observational assets including NOAA's newly-upgraded dual-polarization network of WSR-88D radars. Anticipated longer-term impacts include improved ability of numerical models to simulate precipitation substructures in winter storms with direct application to forecasts benefiting the public, as well as recruitment of new scientists qualified to undertake atmospheric field research.",

Nationwide, nearly 7000 deaths, 600,000 injuries, and 1.4 million accidents per year are due to adverse road weather, mostly during winter. This is one facet of the impact of winter weather on the transportation and power industries as well as schools and businesses. The costs of a single blizzard in a populated region can range from $0.1M to $3.0B. Improvement of forecasts of winter precipitation depends on obtaining a greater understanding of the structure and dynamics of winter cyclones, the large weather systems that bring most hazardous winter weather to the USA.\n\nThe research conducted under this grant directly targeted this problem. The Universities of Illinois, Alabama-Huntsville, Missouri, and Wyoming, using an instrumented C-130 research aircraft, special ground-based radar systems, and other equipment, conducted a two-year field campaign called the Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) project in the winters of 2008-9 and 2009-10 designed to address outstanding scientific questions about winter storm structure, with the goal of improving our understanding of snowstorms and blizzards in the northwest and warm frontal quadrants of extratropical cyclones that occur over the continental United States. These data were also supplemented with a flight of the instrumented GV aircraft over a Northeast U.S. cyclone. The field campaign was designed to provide new insight concerning radar measurements of winter weather systems that can translate directly into better operational interpretation and observation strategies of winter weather.  The education components of the project involved students from nine Midwestern universities, and allowed over 400 students from these universities to tour the research facilities and hear lectures from the project scientists about the measurements and the research.\n\nOur analyses have led to several discoveries about winter storm structure.  The most important is the ubiquitous presence of convection within these storms, particularly near cloud top and in the southern quadrant of the cyclone?s comma head (the northern part of a cyclone most commonly containing severe winter conditions), and the role of the dry airstream wrapping into a cyclone from the southwest in triggering this convection.  Our research showed that the dry air associated with a cyclone?s \"dry slot\" frequently intrudes over air from the Gulf of Mexico creating two zones of precipitation within the comma head, a northern zone characterized by deep stratiform clouds and topped by convective cloud top \"generating cells\", and a southern zone marked by deeper elevated convection occurring aloft over cold air at the surface.  We found that lightning and so-called \"thundersnow\", when it occurs, appears to originate from this elevated convection within the southern zone.  An outcome of the projects was that we were able to unambiguously determine the structure of the convection, the nature of the instability that caused it to occur, the microphysical processes by which precipitation forms in the convection, and how the dry airstream creates the instability.\n\nA key outcome of the research was the new understanding the research provided concerning the importance of cloud-top convective \"generating cells\" in the generation of snowfall across the storms.  The cloud-top convective cells are called generating cells because they generate the \"seed\" ice crystals that grow to become the snow that falls to the ground in the lower part of the storm.  Our field and modeling research provided a clear understanding of the role of the dry airstream in creating the instability to trigger the generating cells and the role of cloud-top radiative cooling in maintaining the strength of generating cells over time. Our studies allowed us to determine the microphysical structure (ice particle concentrations and supercooled water contents) of the generating cells, the vertical velocities that occur within the cells, and document that rapid ice particle growth that occurs within the cells.\n\nAnother outcome of the research was a new understanding of frontal structure within the northwest quadrant of the winter cyclones.  The fronts across the northwest quadrant of the storm were found to be atypical of fronts commonly observed in other sectors of extratropical cyclones.  The front bounding the Gulf and Canadian airmasses, although quite distinct in terms of precipitation distribution, wind, and moisture, was marked by almost no horizontal thermal contrast.  The higher altitude front bounding Gulf and dry Pacific airmasses had characteristics of a warm front, but with stable Gulf air below and less-stable Pacific air aloft. We also learned more about the role of the Great Lakes in major snowstorms in the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor, a major population center in the U.S.\n\nAdditional research has elucidated the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and their impacts on radar signatures, precipitation intensity and microphysics, and the relationship of polarization radar signatures to the shapes, sizes and concentrations of ice particles comprising snowfall.  The research has provided some of the first information available on the frontal structure and precipitation processes occurring within \"Alberta Clipper\"cyclones.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert M Rauber"
