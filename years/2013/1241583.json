 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distributions of bird species are limited by factors of the environment.  Different species have different ranges of environmental conditions that they tolerate.  Some of the conditions that birds are constrained by will shift as climate changes. In fact, some species are already shifting their ranges toward the poles or to higher elevations.  Researchers have used statistical models to relate spatial environmental data and the occurrence of bird species.  They then change the data to reflect the way conditions may appear in the future and use the models to predict the ways in which bird species will shift their distributions as a result.  This approach has been criticized because it ignores the interactions between species, that species can adapt to new environments, and that some species are better at dispersing than others.  A new method that avoids these limitations will be used in this project.  Statistical models will be used to predict the occurrence and relative abundance of birds across the United States that build on a long running survey of bird occurrences along with a suite of spatial data.  The models will then be incorporated into a simulation model using an agent-based framework, where agents are the group of birds of an individual species that occupy a small part of the landscape.  The models that describe the ways in which birds are distributed will be allowed to evolve in response to the environments available and the presence of other species.  For example, small changes in the temperature range of a species may occur as it moves into new landscapes.  Adjustments will then be made to the simulation model until the distribution of birds is similar to their real, current distributions.  Finally, response surfaces that reflect climate change effects will replace those that represent current conditions and the simulations will be continued.  The distributions of bird species will thus evolve in response to the new conditions and the results will reflect how bird distributions and communities may change under a future climate, considering interactions between species and the ability of the species themselves to adapt.\r\n\r\nModels that represent how individuals respond to changing environmental conditions are rare in studies of how species are distributed.  The method used here has the potential to address a variety of questions and to make analyses dynamic, with patterns of species distributions developing over time during the computer simulations.  The effort will support a PhD candidate who will work with a new team, with new data sets, and learn new research skills.  The results will be used in university courses and workshops and to train high school students.  Results will be published in journal articles and summarized on a project web site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe kinds of birds at peoples\u00c6 feeders will change as our climate changes.  The geographic ranges of birds will shift north and to higher elevations as the climate warms.  The most common way analysts predict how the ranges of species will change is by finding how spatial climate data matches where birds have been seen, then replacing the climate data with predictions from the future and applying the same relationships.  This approach disregards the ways that: competition with other species affects distributions, species can change the kinds of habitats they use, and species have limited abilities to disperse.  We developed a method that incorporates these effects.\n\n \n\nWe used a method called agent-based modeling, where birds of a given species in an area were the things being simulated by the computer, called agents.  The relationships between climate and the areas used by birds were stored in the simulation, for 145 species in the continental US.  In a loop, the agents compete to occupy patches of land across the country.  The ways the agents relate to the environment can change very slowly, changing the ways that agents compete to occupy places.  Through this process, species distributions evolve in response to climate change.\n\n \n\nOur methods yielded distributions that differed, sometimes by a great deal, from the distributions made with the traditional methods.  Three species are shown as examples, showing the map of Killdeer, Sage Thrasher, and Eastern Bluebird (Figures 1-3) as they were mapped using a method called binary tree regression (a) and what it looks like (b) after all the species compete to occupy areas.  The distributions projected in 2050 using results from a climate change model produced in Beijing and traditional methods are shown (c), and the distributions can be quite different when competition is included (d).  The distributions of most species shrank under climate change, but the best competitors expanded their distributions.\n\n \n\nIn addition to our research outcomes, we have supported and trained two graduate students and an undergraduate student at Colorado State University.  Students and investigators have participated in annual meetings of the program and learned about proposal preparation and communication.  Results have been shared in meetings, are being prepared for publication, and a website shares our products.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall B Boone"
