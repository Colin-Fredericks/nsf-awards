A central feature of the research will be the use of time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopic, ultra-fast laser spectroscopy and confocal near-IR Raman techniques to measure molecular changes in optogenetic rhodopsins upon light excitation on a time-scale of seconds to femtoseconds. Preliminary work has demonstrated that a variety of optogenetic rhodopsins can be reconstituted into proteolipid membranes including nanolipidparticles and studied using advanced spectroscopic methods to obtain detailed molecular information about their function. In addition, spectroscopic studies have been extended to living cells allowing these proteins to be studied in their native environment in order to determine molecule effects of such factors as membrane potential. Collaborators on this project include: Dr. Ed Boyden at MIT, widely recognized as one of the co-founders of optogenetics and a leading developer of new neurophotonic technology; Dr. Matt Coleman at UCD, who has developed methods of expressing rhodopsins into nanolipidparticles (NLPs) and forming microcrystals suitable for coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI), Dr. John Spudich, at the U. Texas Med. School, a pioneer in the field of microbial rhodopsins and co-discoverer of channelrhodopsins and Dr. Adam Cohen, whose laboratory at Harvard University has recently demonstrated that rhodopsins can be used to monitor transmembrane voltage in living nerves.",

These methods provide a dynamic picture at the molecular level of the structural change which these proteins undergo once they absorb a photon of light.  \nChannelrhodopsins (ChRs) are a type of microbial rhodopsin (Type 1 rhodopsin) found in algae which serve as   the primary photoreceptor for phototaxis.  Since their initial discovery in 2002  and subsequent expression in neurons to produce optogenetic control in 2005 by Boyden and Deisseroth, ChRs have revolutionized neuroscience and hold great promise in other biological and biomedical areas.\nSignificant progress was achieved towards the goals of this project, the highlights of which are summarize below: \n1)              Probing retinal structure in a red-shifted channelrhodopsin:  In this study, near-infrared confocal resonance Raman spectroscopy along with hydrogen-deuterium exchange and site-directed mutagenesis were used to study the structure of the retinal chromophore in a red-shifted ChR from Chlamydomonas augustae (CaChR1).

We found that that at pH 7 Glu169 exists in a protonated form (i.e. neutral state), whereas Asp299 exists in an ionized form and serves as the predominant counterion for the protonated SB.  In a subsequent study, we discovered the existence of an unusual proton relay mechanism involving Glu169 and Asp299.  One interesting aspect of this model is the existence of an unusual charge neutrality of the residues in a position to serve as the Schiff base counterions in the P2380 channel conducting state suggesting that these residues may function as part of a cation selective filter in the open channel state of CaChR1 as well as other ChRs.\n3)             Probing the Structure and Conformational Changes of an Anion Conduction Channelrhodopsin: Recently, a new class of natural ChRs, termed anion channel rhodopsins (ACRs), has been discovered.
