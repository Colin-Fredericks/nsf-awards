 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are\r\noften caused by the storage system, because the gap between storage device\r\nand CPU speeds is greater than in any other part of the machine.  Big data\r\nand new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are\r\nstill optimized for legacy workloads and hard disks.  The team at Stony\r\nBrook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that\r\nlarge systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases\r\ncomputing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's\r\nenergy independence.\r\n\r\nFirst, the team is examining modern workloads running on a variety of\r\nplatforms, including individual computers, large compute farms, and a\r\nnext-generation infrastructure, such as Stony Brook's Reality Deck, a\r\nmassive gigapixel visualization facility.  These workloads produce combined\r\nperformance and energy traces that are being released to the community.\r\n\r\nSecond, the team is applying techniques such as statistical feature\r\nextraction, Hidden Markov Modeling, data-mining, and conditional likelihood\r\nmaximization to analyze these data sets and traces.  The Reality Deck is\r\nused to visualize the resulting multi-dimensional performance/energy data\r\nsets.  The team's analyses reveal fundamental phenomena and principles that\r\ninform future designs.\r\n\r\nThird, the findings from the first two efforts are being combined to develop\r\nnew storage architectures that best balance performance and energy under\r\ndifferent workloads when used with modern devices, such as solid-state\r\ndrives (SSDs), phase-change memories, etc.  The designs leverage the team's\r\nwork on storage-optimized algorithms, multi-tier storage, and new optimized\r\ndata structures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we investigated how computers can use their hard disk\ndrives (HDDs) and solid-state disk drives (SSDs) as efficiently as\npossible.  Our goal was to save both time and energy.  Disk drives (of\nboth types) are the slowest parts of computer systems, so making them\nfaster has a direct effect on the performance that users see.  As it\nturns out, improving speed also saves electricity, so we were able to\nconcentrate on making things faster and more efficient at the same time.\n\nOne of the most important things that affect disk-drive performance is\nthe question of precisely where information is stored on the disk, in\nrelation to what has already been used.  The situation is analogous to\na room full of filing cabinets: if you have already opened the top\ndrawer of the third cabinet from the left, it is easy to look at other\nfiles in that same drawer.  It is slightly more work, but still fairly\neasy, to look for files in other drawers from that same cabinet, or\nfrom the cabinet right next to it.  But if what you want is on the\nother side of the room, you have to waste time walking there before\nyou can see the file.  In the same way, computer disk drives \"like\" to\nread and write data that is \"close\" to what they are already using.\n\nIn our project, we investigated the problem of how to arrange data on\nthe disk drive so that the computer can get to it quickly.  Returning\nto the filing-cabinet analogy, it is as if we had an assistant who\ncould predict which files we were going to be interested in on a\nparticular day.  The assistant would then rearrange the files in the\ncabinet so that the first thing we wanted was at the front of the top\ndrawer, the second was just behind it, and so forth.  Thanks to the\nassistant, we wouldn't have  to waste time walking back and forth in\nthe filing room.\n\nThe trick, of course, is to find a way to automate the assistant's\nwork.  Although we did not completely solve this difficult problem, we\ngained significant understanding of how to approach it, which will\nhelp future researchers invent a complete solution.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoff Kuenning"
