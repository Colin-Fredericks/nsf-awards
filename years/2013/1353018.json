They expect that these initial experiments will establish the experimental techniques and data analysis methods needed to conduct important, ground-breaking studies on the basic neuroscience underlying sight restoration. The objectives are:  1: Assess cortical representations of electrical retinal stimulations delivered via the Argus II retinal prosthesis; 2: Assess cortical plasticity associated with retinal prosthesis use; and 3: Measure neural plasticity in an animal model of retinal degeneration using chronic stimulation.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of these objectives will demonstrate feasibility of a set of core techniques that are foundational and transformative for advancing the development of retinal prostheses and the understanding of cortical plasticity in implant recipients.",
