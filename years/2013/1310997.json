 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Luke J. Linhoff of Florida International University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The project title is \"Testing Applied Amphibian Conservation Methodologies.\" The host scientist is Dr. David Bickford.\r\n\r\nThe term \"translocation\" is used to describe any anthropogenically caused movement of living organisms from one area to another. Amphibian conservation programs utilize translocations for endangered species reintroductions, habitat mitigations, species restoration, and rehabilitations. However, little research has studied the subsequent behavioral and physiological effects on amphibians following translocation. This project focuses on 3 goals: 1) developing a long term research plan to develop tropical amphibian translocation experiments that can be replicated on temperate amphibians; 2) performing short translocation trails comparing methodologies on a common leaf litter frog; 3) initiating testing to assess a non-invasive attachment technique for radio transmitters that will eventually be used to track amphibians.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this research will have direct and immediate application to a growing movement to save endangered amphibians. If conservation programs have more scientifically sound recommendations, it may be possible to save a larger number of species.",
