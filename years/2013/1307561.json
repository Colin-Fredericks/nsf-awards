 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to elucidate the science underlying the optical properties of nanowires, and to harness these properties for novel photonic devices. The approach is to develop the science needed for nanowire-based photodetectors, for filter arrays for multispectral and polarization imaging, and for plasmonic lasers. The photodetector and filters will be based upon the recent discovery by the Principal Investigator's group that vertical silicon nanowires can appear a wide variety of colors that depend on their radii. The lasers will consist of nanowires positioned in plasmonic waveguides.\r\nIntellectual merit: Due to their unique attributes, much interest has been paid over the past decade to semiconducting nanowires. It is somewhat surprising how little attention has been paid to the dramatic effects that waveguiding and resonance phenomena can have upon their optical properties. This work will reveal the science, and demonstrate that these phenomena can be used advantageously for nanowire-based photonics.\r\nBroader impacts: While the proposed program will investigate the science, it is entirely possible that the devices studied in this work will find their way, in some form, into commercial products. The work therefore could contribute to the United States photonics industry. The project also creates not only the science, but also the human infrastructure required for future advances. The Principal Investigator will provide training to a diverse range of undergraduate and graduate students, and will undertake a variety of outreach efforts in the local community.",

These devices have important industrial impacts.  For example, precisely selected wavelength (color) gives much better reproduction of color and opens the potential for creating semiconductor multispectral sensors.  Such small, low energy consumption and light weight multispectral devices have tremendous advantages over large and expensive spectrometers and can be used for many applications including food analysis, remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles and medical applications.  Photon-detector nanowires create very small image sensors; today?s smallest pixel areas are 1000x bigger than the area of a nanowire photodetector.  Nanowire photodetectors are important for biological and robotics applications.\n\nLight propagates in semiconductor nanowires as a wave, and the structure is a waveguide in which the waves get admitted or reflected, fully or partially absorbed and may be converted to electrical signal.  We showed how the geometrical features of these nanostructures play a critical role in light propagation and absorption.  We examined different geometric features such as the length, diameter, spacing between the wires, shapes, and cross sections.  Through this extensive study we unraveled the unique photonic properties of these devices and made proposals for use in applications by creating laboratory prototypes. \n\nThe general physics of light propagation in nanowires is universal, and does not change with the wavelength of the incident light.  As one would expect, however, semiconductor materials of different electronic energy gaps are effective in different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.  For example, silicon functions well in the UV, visible and near IR (~ 900nm) of the spectrum, whereas germanium performs up to mid IR (1700nm).\n\nAs light waves impinge on the nanowires, particular wavelengths are coupled and modes propagate.  We showed (Figures1 and 2) that this phenomenon is determined by the diameter of the nanowire.  For example, for a given radius, light of a particular wavelength is both coupled and absorbed.  This phenomenon leads to the creation of efficient and precise optical filters that we employed and used to take pictures with a CCD sensor (Figure3). This filtering may be used for creating RGB filter system that can match the human eye filter, or in a system for wavelength selections to analyze color and determine the nature of a particular material, be it food or health plants or blood circulation in a part of the human body. \n\nThe extent that a wave is absorbed is related to the total volume of the nanowire, and since semiconductors are highly dispersive material of complex index, the absorption is different at different wavelengths.  We showed that short nanowires of few 100 nm are effective absorbers at very short wavelengths, but they need to be longer, of a micron or more, in the visible and 5 to 8 microns long in the near IR.\n\nGeometrical effects are prominent when an array of nanowires is created.  As the evanescent modes propagates outside the wire, but close to the surface, nanowires place close become coupled.  In this event, light absorption changes, and the array transmit wavelengths up to a particular value, at which the wave is fully absorbed.  Other geometrical effect such as tapering the nanowire (figure4) showed broadening of the region of absorption, i.e. the nanowire is an effective absorber of wavers of several wavelengths. For example, a 300 nm germanium nanowire with 3:2 base-to-tip tapering absorbs from 1300 to 1600 nm (Figure5).  Such a device might be useful for particular applications in the mid IR.\n\nSemiconductor nanowire can also be active devices, and we created p-n junctions along the axis of the wire and also shell-like junctions.
