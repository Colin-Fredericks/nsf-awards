We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the  nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central  to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to  the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates  features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to  provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly  in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also  for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications.  In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of  this project should have a substantial application to many other  equations of this general type which play important roles in other  parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. \r\n\r\nEinstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job  of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the  astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every  known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of  view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very  distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational  fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear  system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations  (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein  constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent  PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a  more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact  between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many  advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and  which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the  physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological  scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open  questions in this area.",

At the project's commencement, however, there was a single result, due to a project PI, that showed that in a special case the non-CMC method exhibits flaws.  The result used 'non-smooth' conformal seed data, however, and it was conceivable that the breakdowns were only a consequence of the non-smoothness.\n\nOne of the first project results gave examples of smooth initial data sets that exhibited an extreme form of breakdown: conformal seed data that either generated no solutions or that generated an infinite family of solutions of the constraint equations; seed data should generate a single solution.  The results again concerned a very special case of seed data (which generate so-called Kasner spacetimes), but consequently were able to describe the breakdowns in rich detail.\n\nDuring the project's time frame other authors (notably T-C Nguyen), found additional special cases where the non-CMC conformal method breaks down.

So all the failings of the conformal method apply equally to the conformal thin-sandwich method.  This work received a journal award for being a 'highlight of the year'.\n\nGuided by insights from the Kasner examples, we developed a new technique, the drift method, for describing initial data sets.  It contains the CMC conformal method as a special case and corrects the deficiencies of the conformal method seen in the Kasner setting.
