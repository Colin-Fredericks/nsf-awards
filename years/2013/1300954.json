The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in algebraic and hyperbolic geometry in order to explore new connections between the two fields, the latter include: 2-dimensional Cremona group, fundamental groups of Kaehler manifolds, minimal model program,  geometrization and geometry of complex ball quotients. \r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together researchers working in two branches of geometry: Algebraic geometry, which deals with geometry of solution sets of algebraic equations and hyperbolic geometry, which deals with concepts like distances, angles and areas. The goal of the conference is to explore new mutually beneficial connections between the two areas of mathematics. This project will benefit the graduate students and young researchers. It will also promote interaction between the US and Latin American geometers.\r\n\r\nThe conference's homepage is:\r\nhttp://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/eventos/store/evento_1306",
