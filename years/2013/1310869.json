 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Michael Schulz of the University of Florida to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan.  The project title is \"Understanding the Connection between Binding and Molecular Architecture in Polymer-Metal Mixtures.\" The host scientist is Yoshiki Chujo.\r\n\r\nPolyethyleneimine-methylphosphonate (PEI-MP) is an anionic polymer--a negatively charged large molecule--that has been studied as a polymeric ligand to bind to certain metals, specifically radioactivce atoms, or radionuclides. However, the binding of PEI-MP to radionuclides is not understood at a fundamental level. This project is studying various potential binding configurations of the polymer system with a simplified, small molecule system. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is being used to measure the thermodynamic parameters of each binding mode. This information provides insight into which molecular configurations form the most stable coordinate complexes, i.e., which are the most effective at binding to different metals. Understanding the binding of PEI-MP at a fundamental level will allow the rational design and improvement of future polymeric radionuclide carriers. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow has demonstrated a commitment to undergraduate education, involving undergraduate students in the scientific preparation required prior to the start of the EAPSI fellowship. He will include undergraduates in new research and collaborations that result from interactions with the host scientist as well.",
