 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project headed up by investigators from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, analyzes, evaluates, and compares small group work on inquiry-based tasks and engineering design tasks in high school science classes. The research based recommendations for the reform of science education stress the teaching and learning of scientific and engineering practices in order for students to understand and experience how scientists and engineers work, and how scientific knowledge is produced and engineering solutions are developed. Yet, fundamental differences that have been noted in the professional practices of scientists compared to engineers, so it follows that the nature of productive group work in high school science should vary depending on whether the task involves scientific inquiry or engineering design. The investigators look at the cognitive, social, and affective resources individual bring to various problem solving tasks.\r\n\r\nGauging what social, psychological and cognitive resources students need for inquiry and engineering design activities will strengthen professional development for science teachers about providing better scaffolding for group work. Furthermore, results of this research may be used to create valid diagnostic tools to evaluate students' varying strengths and weaknesses and to use these profiles to assemble students in small groups that are optimal for science learning. It should also help teachers to monitor on-going group process, which will guide themas they decide how and when to intervene to support groups in differentially structured inquiry-based and engineering design tasks.",

First, we broke new ground in the research community?s understanding of small group work. Previously, emphasis was placed exclusively on the group?s ability to work together on the cognitive aspects of the task (the problem to be solved). Later research emphasized that groups must attend to and develop the ?relational dimension? (the challenges based on social interactions within the group) in addition to the cognitive or content dimension. Barron?s 2003 ?dual-space? model). We hypothesized that the affective domain (e.g., interest, curiosity, frustration) is also an important and separate dimension distinguishing small groups. We found evidence to support our concept of the <em>triple problem solving space, </em>because in our study of 52 small groups in 9 high school biology classes, we saw groups distributed across all areas of these 3 dimensions. Some groups were low on all dimensions (cognitive, social/relational, affective); other groups were high across the board but a little less than half of all groups had a mixed profile of scoring high and low across the dimension (see Figure A). Our study filled a gap in the literature by taking an <em>analytical</em> view of small group work, rather than merely descriptive, empirically tracing the impact of the specific individual resources to the co-construction of the problem solving space and assessing subsequent effects on student learning. Using a mixed methods approach of surveys, learning assessments and video (of a subset of small groups) on a relatively large number of classrooms our results allow us to generalize tentatively beyond the research base that has relied heavily on qualitative case studies (Bennett, et al. 2010).</p>\n<p>We wondered how aspects of the group?s triple problem-solving space would be activated during traditional (but still open-ended) inquiry tasks (Pill Bug behavior, 'Naked Egg' osmosis, Snail-Elodea Photosynthesis cycle) compared to the kind of engineering design activities (Oil spill containment and cleanup, Heart valve design, Pill coating design) that are mandated by the recent science standards (NGSS 2013). One difference is that the affect expressed in the group varies much more widely with the engineering design tasks, which tend to be new for both students and teachers. As they work on engineering tasks, students experience excitement but also frustration; affect tended to be flatter during the science inquiry tasks. These are patterns that it might be helpful for teachers to be aware of. We also found that students in the urban, working-class school in our study found the engineering design tasks especially interesting, more so than students in schools serving a wealthier, more educated population. Thus, inclusion of engineering design in high school biology might serve to entice students who are at risk of ending their science study early to enroll in advanced, elective science courses later in high school. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Teachers who use small group activities may assemble groups based on a gut sense of which students get along, or who is bringing sufficient prior science knowledge to the tasks. Our study found that the resources that an individual student brings to group work is related to how the student perceives the quality of the group?s functioning later. If student A does not have many resources, it helps student A?s perception of the group?s quality if others in the group bring resources to bear. The most important resources that members can bring to the group to bolster group functioning are interest, a perception of competence in science and strong science self-concept. Interpersonal skills play a small role in building group capacity in the triple problem solving space. Interestingly, when a group member brings prior biology knowledge to the group?s work, it does not seem to help the group?s functioning. (See Figures B and C.) Finally, there are hints that a strong group, that is a group that is high on all three dimensions of the problem solving space, is associated with better learning, although only for learning engineering design practices, and almost all of the effect on learning is among boys. (See Figure D.) For reasons that we are still exploring, girls tend not to garner as much benefit from group work as boys do.</p>\n<p>Our naturalistic investigation in actual classrooms already shows practical value. We found that a teacher?s interaction with the group affected their group dynamics in different ways depending on the nature of the teachers? interaction. Teachers who engage students in the problem solving process (e.g., asking exploratory questions), had the capacity to increase the cognitive work of the group, but also had the potential to impact the affective and social dimension positively or negatively, stoking frustration or engagement, social loafing or solidarity. Professional development for biology teachers on how to incorporate engineering design and how to interact effectively in small group work is warranted, based on our study.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Mceneaney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551020927_FigureA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551020927_FigureA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Distribution of Groups Across Triple Problem Solving Space\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551020927_FigureA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Distribution of Groups Across Triple Problem Solving Space\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cognitive, Social and Affective dimensions of group dynamics vary somewhat independently</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth McEneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;Mceneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Distribution of Groups Across Triple Problem Solving Space</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551179970_FigureB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551179970_FigureB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ego Resources and Perceived Group Dynamics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551179970_FigureB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ego Resources and Perceived Group Dynamics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The resources an individual student brings to the group are related to their perception of how the group functions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth McEneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;Mceneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ego Resources and Perceived Group Dynamics</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551372252_FigureC--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551372252_FigureC--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Others' Resources and Perceived Group Quality\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551372252_FigureC--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Others' Resources and Perceived Group Quality\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The resources that *other* group members bring to your group influence to some extent how you perceive your group's functioning</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth McEneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;Mceneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Others' Resources and Perceived Group Quality</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551512711_FigureD--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551512711_FigureD--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group Quality and Student Learning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1252339/1252339_10273677_1543551512711_FigureD--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group Quality and Student Learning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group quality, as measured by scores on cognitive, social and affective dimensions of the triple problem solving space, has modest effects on learning of engineering design practices -- but mostly for boys.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth McEneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;Mceneaney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Quality and Student Learning</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
