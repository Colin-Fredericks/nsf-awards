 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThe objectives of this CAREER proposal, sponsored by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, are to clarify the processes by which metal nanowires grow in solution, use this understanding to improve synthetic control over metal nanowire dimensions, and study the structure-property relationship of metal nanowires in the context of practical applications. Nanowire nucleation and growth will be visualized in real-time with dark-field optical microscopy and transition electron microscopy. The kinetic data obtained from visualization will be a powerful tool for addressing several unanswered questions about nanowire growth, including: (1) Does the species adding to the nanowire consist of metal ions, reduced metal atoms, or metal clusters? (2) What is the chemical step that limits the rate of nanowire growth? (3) How does the capping agent alter nanowire growth kinetics and nanowire morphology? A deeper understanding of the role of the capping agent will facilitate the discovery a new capping agents that enable the production of nanowires across a broader range of dimensions. Measurement of the temperature-dependent nucleation rate will facilitate the separation of nanowire nucleation from nanowire growth in time by engineering the temperature profile of the reaction, and thus allow for the production of nanowires with precisely defined lengths and diameters.  The well-defined nanowires obtained from synthetic studies will be used as a platform for understanding the structure-property relationships of nanowires in the context of a transparent, conducting film, and an optical polarizer. \r\n\r\nNON TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nMetal nanowires, which look similar to pine needles but are 10,000 times smaller, have the potential to reduce the cost and improve the performance of touch screens, solar cells, organic LEDs, flat-panel displays, electrochromic windows, augmented reality displays, lightning strike protection for aircraft, battery electrodes, sensors, catalysts, and wearable electronics. At present, the processes by which nanowires spontaneously grow in liquids are poorly understood, and this is limiting the development of better ways to control the dimensions of nanowires so as to understand and optimize their properties in practical applications.  This CAREER proposal, sponsored by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, describes an integrated research and educational plan dedicated to discovering why nanowires grow, using this information to grow nanowires with unprecedented precision over a wide range of dimensions, studying the properties of these structures in the context of applications with academic and industrial partners, and disseminating these results to the public though an outreach program that aims to improve participation of underrepresented groups.  The research approach will focus on the development of techniques that allow researchers to watch, in real-time, the assembly of atoms into nanowires.  Goals of this fundamental study include finding (1) the processes by which nanowires form, (2) the factors that influence the dimensions of a nanowire, and (3) how to control the dimensions of nanowires with greater precision over a greater range of sizes. The structure-dependent properties of nanowires will then be characterized in solar cells, and in contact lenses for augmented reality glasses.  The new discoveries generated by this program will be integrated into hands-on activities by African American high-school students working with graduate student mentors, and presented to the broader public through science fairs, classroom demonstrations, museum exhibits and online videos.",

The kinetic data from in situ visualization allowed us to show that nanowire growth can be limited by diffusion of copper ion complexes to the ends of the nanowire, or by the rate at which the copper ion reduction occurs on the metal surface. These results motivated us to think that metal nanowire growth was a form of facet-selective electroless plating, and that electrochemical studies of the chemistry occurring on different single crystal surfaces might provide insights into what is causing anisotropic growth to occur. To test this hypothesis, we examined the chemistry occurring at single-crystal Cu(100) and Cu(111) surfaces (to represent nanowire sides and ends, respectively) in a Cu nanowire synthesis solution. We showed that, rather than selectively blocking atomic addition to the sides as was previously thought, the organic additive promoted Cu nanowire growth by keeping the Cu(111) surface relatively free of surface oxidation in the highly basic growth solution (&gt;12 M NaOH). The work shows that a combination of in situ visualization and single-crystal electrochemistry can help to solve the mystery of how and why metal nanowires grow.</p>\n<p>This project has also greatly expanded our knowledge of how the structure of nanowires affect their properties in numerous applications. For example, simulations for how the dimensions of nanowires affect the performance of nanowire-based transparent conductors showed that producing nanowires with high aspect ratios is critical to good performance.&nbsp; Subsequent synthetic work increased the aspect ratio from 100 to 5700, increasing the transparency of conductive nanowire films from 65% to 95%, good enough for use in touch screens. This project developed ways to coat thin layers of Ni, Co, Zn, Sn, In, Ag, Au, and Pt on Cu nanowires to protect copper nanowires from oxidation, as well as enable tuning of their optical, electronic, and chemical properties (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).&nbsp;Cu nanowires were used as the transparent conductor in organic solar cells, optically transparent catalysts for photoelectrochemical hydrolysis, as well fully-printed memristive memory for the first time during this grant.</p>\n<p>This project has contributed to the training of four postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, two visiting scholars, 12 undergraduates, and four high school students.
