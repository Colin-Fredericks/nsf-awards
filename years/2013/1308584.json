 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Tunable optical components, ones where their properties can be altered to realize different physical and optical behavior, are of widespread interest for diverse applications ranging from spectroscopy to imaging.  Most of these components sacrifice optical performance for tunability and they are manufactured using structures and processes that are difficult to miniaturize.  In this collaborative project, researchers from the University of Central Florida, Pennsylvania State University, and Lockheed Martin are optimizing infrared chalcogenide materials and nanostructures that exhibit reversible amorphous-to-crystalline phase transitions to have tailored refractive index values and dispersive properties that are continuously tunable.  The availability of such chalcogenide phase change materials will enable the development of new compact, tunable optical components by exploiting the exceptionally large refractive index change associated with the phase transition.  The chalcogenide materials and processes being developed in this project are broadly available through the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Optical materials with compositionally tailored properties that are spectrally tunable and reversible are attractive for producing optical components with unique functionalities.  Chalcogenide phase change materials (PCMs) exhibit rapid and reversible amorphous-to-crystalline phase transitions in response to pulsed thermal, optical, or electrical stimuli.  However, current optical devices based on chalcogenide PCMs have only exploited the large change in optical reflectance associated with the transition between the pure amorphous and the pure crystalline states of the material.  In this collaborative project, researchers from the University of Central Florida, Pennsylvania State University, and Lockheed Martin are conducting experimental studies to identify a chalcogenide composition that enables controlled nucleation and growth of spatially dispersed nanocrystals, which will produce a continuously tunable and reproducible change in the infrared refractive index and dispersion of the composite glass ceramic material.  For each composition, bulk, thin film, and nanopatterned films are being characterized to understand the role of device-relevant boundary conditions on the nucleation and growth process induced by external optical or thermal excitation.  Complementary techniques are being applied to understand the fundamental relationship between the intrinsic material response and the tailored optical performance, including thermal, structural, and optical measurement and analysis.  The structure-property data being collected during this project will provide the critical input needed to design fully tunable optical components using chalcogenide PCMs.  A new mentoring team program, which links university and industry partnered researchers, trains graduate and undergraduate students to have globally-relevant workforce skills.  The chalcogenide phase change materials and processes being developed in this project are available to the broader external academic and industrial community through the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) located at Pennsylvania State University.",

The micro-hotplate circuit provides accurate temperature control of the patterned PCM film from room temperature up to 800&deg;C using a pulsed bias voltage. &nbsp;Research was conducted to quantify the crystallization behavior of fully tunable and reconfigurable PCM&rsquo;s with continuously tunable effective refractive index values intermediate between fully amorphous and fully crystalline as illustrated in Figure 2. For compatibility with the photonic platform, the PCM materials should have low IR loss and be stable at elevated temperatures and with cycling between amorphous and crystalline phases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The electrically driven micro-hotplate used to tune the patterned Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> (GST) PCM film is shown in Figure 3. The width and length of each micro-hotplate can be tailored to uniformly heat the PCM but not induce cross-talk between adjacent on-chip devices. A doped-Si resistor was used because it provides excellent thermal stability and low IR loss. The underlying SiO<sub>2</sub> layer, which is a relatively poor thermal conductor, was optimized for rapid heating and cooling of the GST film. Finally, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was used for the GST barrier and capping layers because it provides: (1) electrical isolation between the heater and electrically conductive PCM; (2) high thermal conductivity for uniform heat spreading across the 10 mm-scale active area; and (3) low reactivity with the GST at elevated operating temperature.</p>\n<p>The optical microscope images in Figure 3 (bottom) show that an initally crystalline GST could be fully and uniformly amorphized by applying a msec-voltage pulse to the silicon micro-hotplate. Re-crystallization of the entire GST layer was obtained by applying either a series of 100 msec voltage pulses or a single 1 ms voltage pulse to the micro-hotplate. No degradation was observed in the optical contrast or uniformity of this large-area test structure with cycling. Thermal modeling confirmed that the local temperature increase due to heat spreading to neighboring tunable elements spaced a few microns (1-3 mm&rsquo;s) away from the biased micro-hotplate is well below the temperatures required for crystallization, which enables multiple proximate tunable elements on the same chip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many chalcogenide PCM's have been explored for memory applications, but the attributes required for integrated photonic platforms have not been emphasized previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;To further understand the crystallization behavior of a material, nucleation (I) and growth (U) curves can be enlisted.&nbsp; The I and U curves for different PCMs were used to down-select/engineer a specific composition that results in the size, size distribution, and spatial distribution of the crystals formed within the glass matrix by defining temperature regimes appropriate for controlled crystal formation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The principal challenge addressed in this program was the selection of a multicomponent chalcogenide system where slow(er) crystallization rates can be engineered by compositionally tuning the I/U curves.
