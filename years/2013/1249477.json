 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from Southern Illinois University (SIU) and Saint Louis University (SLU) are deploying 45 broadband seismographs and three short-period seismic arrays in the Wabash Valley in Illinois and Indiana. The experiment is part of the on-going EarthScope project and is aimed at better understanding the driving forces of the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone (WVSZ) such as regional lithospheric stresses exploiting a weak zone, glacial isostatic adjustment, and lithospheric basal tractions induced by mantle dynamics.  By applying a variety of seismic techniques including body wave and surface wave tomography, receiver functions, shear-wave splitting, and mapping of background crustal seismicity, this seismic experiment will illuminate the seismic structure beneath the study area and impose valuable constraints on driving mechanism for this geologically enigmatic feature as well as further our understanding of intraplate earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis project directly advances the Earthscope mission to advance our understanding of intraplate seismic zone dynamics and to improve seismic hazard assessments in the midcontinent. It allows for more quantitative comparisons between the WVSZ and the New Madrid Seismic Zone to its south. It furthers the education of a PhD student at SIU and one at SLU as well as sponsors undergraduate research at both institutions. The students are involved in a number of different aspects of the research from the fieldwork comprising station installation, servicing, and data collection to data analysis and interpretation. These students learn a number of seismic analytical methods that point them towards further research and study within the framework of EarthScope and other cutting-edge scientific initiatives. The PIs of the project work with science teachers at several high schools located in the study area. Two seismographs are located on school property, with display for students to view real-time seismic data and provide access to educational resources from Earthscope.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p><span>The Wabash Seismic Array was an EarthScope funded FlexArray deployment across the Wabash Fault System along the Illinois-Indiana border. The experiment consisted of 45 broadband instruments deployed across the axis and 3 smaller phased arrays of 9 short-period instruments. The fault system is often characterized as an intraplate seismic zone as it has produced several earthquakes above M4 in the last 50 years and potentially several above M7 in the Holocene. While the number of recorded earthquakes are far less numerous in the Wabash system the than in the nearby New Madrid seismic zone, the seismic energy output has been nearly twice that of New Madrid over the past 50 years. Seismicity on the Wabash faults appear to occur on E-W and N-S conjugate fault sets. Results from the northern phased array indicate that seismicity in the Wabash behaves markedly differently than in New Madrid, with deeper earthquakes and more large earthquakes per small earthquake, suggesting that hazard is currently underestimated from current rates of seismicity. The nearby Cottage Grove Fault System running across much of southern Illinois has a more similar behavior to the Wabash than to New Madrid (deeper and more large events per small event). Despite being considered 'aseismic', the Cottage Grove fault may have a recurrence time for M5 earthquakes as short as 150 years.</span></p>\n<p><span>Receiver function imaging using energy from distant earthquakes shows a ~50 km thick crust beneath the system, thickening somewhat to the west. A positive-amplitude energy conversion in the deep crust gives evidence for a dense rift pillow at the base of the system within a lowermost crustal layer. Low seismic wave speeds and a moderate negative amplitude energy conversion in the mid crust suggest a possible weak zone that could localize deformation. Shear wave splitting, a measure of wave speed variation by direction, shows fast directions consistent with absolute North American plate motion. Splitting times are smaller within the valley (0.5-0.7 seconds) than outside the valley (1-1.5 second). This decrease suggests a change in mantle behavior beneath the fault system, possibly resulting from a small degree of local flow in the mantle either along axis (as may occur with a thinner lithosphere) or by vertical flow (e.g., from lithosphere delamination or dripping). We are constructing a 2D tomographic model across the region, relying primarily on energy from distant earthquakes to image the lithosphere. The tomography should show variations in crustal structure that will give additional context to the receiver function imaging. Possibly more importantly, tomographically imaging the lithosphere will discriminate between hypotheses of mantle flow (along-axis or vertical) required to explain the observed shear wave splitting signature.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/19/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Conder</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1249477/1249477_10234451_1529416145780_Slide_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1249477/1249477_10234451_1529416145780_Slide_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wabash earthquake detection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1249477/1249477_10234451_1529416145780_Slide_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wabash earthquake detection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example seismograms of earthquake detected by Enfield phased array.
