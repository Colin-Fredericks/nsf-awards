The repository distributed more than 27,000 samples over the past three years, over 70% went to non-OSU investigators. Institutional support includes support for the senior curators-in-charge and recent upgrades to the cyber-infrastructure and to refrigerated storage. The collection was recently expanded with the accessioning of 10,000 samples from the Geosciences Department. Proposed new work includes implementation of a state-of-the art bar coding system. In addition to service to the scientific community, the MGR also participates in K-12 and informal science education projects.",
