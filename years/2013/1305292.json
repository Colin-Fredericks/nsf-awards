 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is aimed at enhancing an existing infrastructure that supports software engineering research on very large bodies of source code.  The srcML infrastructure currently includes a generic XML representation for a variety of programming languages, a robust and efficient parser for C/C++, and a limited set of tools to support analysis and manipulation of large bodies of source code.  The infrastructure is currently being used by a wide number of researchers in the fields of software engineering and programming languages.  It is also being directly applied to practical problems in a variety of industrial settings. The srcML infrastructure is open source and freely available to the public via a GPL license.  Documentation for the infrastructure is available online and a number of other resources, including online tutorials, are under development.  Additionally, tutorials on how to use the infrastructure to support various research efforts are planned for a number of software engineering conferences.\r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to extend the current efficient and robust parsing and markup to a broader variety of widely used programming languages (namely Java and C#) and allows for the addition of new languages via a plugin grammar architecture.  The current toolkit is being greatly expanded to support the exploration, analysis, and manipulation of very large code bases.  The tools include such things as a static slicer, metrics computation, various static analysis tools, a fact extractor, a call graph generator, syntactic querying tools, and a syntactic differencing tool.  Additionally, a set of tools to support the construction and application of transformation rules is being developed.  Extending the infrastructure to a broader set of widely used languages enables researchers to investigate more production and commercial software.  \r\nThe enhancements to the srcML infrastructure can drastically reduce the entry cost for individuals to conduct research by enabling them to explore, analyze, and manipulate software in an extremely easy and flexible manner, thus allowing them more time to pursue novel and transformative research on software, software engineering, and software languages.  The addition of analysis, transformation, and syntactic differencing tools enable unproblematic and flexible exploration of large code bases written in widely used programming languages.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project made major enhancements to an existing infrastructure that supports conducting software engineering research on very large bodies of source code.  The srcML infrastructure supports the exploration, analysis, and manipulation of C, C++, C#, and Java source code.  One of the main enhancements to the srcML infrastructure extends the efficient and robust parsing and markup to a broader variety of widely used programming languages (namely Java and C#).  The srcML infrastructure includes a lightweight, highly scalable, multi-language parsing tool that converts source code into an XML format.  Once in the srcML XML format, XML technologies (e.g., Xpath, XSLT) can be used to help explore and analyze the code in an efficient manner.  In short, researchers can leverage srcML and spend more time on new research rather than on engineering basic tools to extract the data necessary to start working on a problem.  The srcML software is licensed under GPL and is freely available to the public.  Another aspect of the enhancements include making the infrastructure well documented, usable, robust, and supported on multiple operating system platforms.  There are downloads are available for Windows, MacOS, and the four main Linux distributions.  The software is well tested and documented.  In addition to the parser and XML format and number of tools built on the infrastructure and are released to the public.  Applications include a highly scalable lightweight program slicing tool, a pointer analysis tool, a tool that reverse engineers UML class diagrams from source code, a type resolution tool, and lastly an sax2 interface for using XML APIs with the srcML infrastructure.\n\nIn total, four graduate students were supported on the award.  Three of these individuals completed the doctoral degree in computer science  Two of them are now Assistant Professors at universities and the other is employed in a startup company.  The four individual is still enrolled in the doctoral program.  Additionally, two REU students were supported during the duration of the project. \n\nThere have been over 5000 downloads of the infrastructure since the start of the project.  A large number of the downloads are by individuals associated with a university.  This includes faculty and graduate students that indicated they were using srcML as part of their research.  Research topics included software testing, program analysis, program transformation, preprocessor analysis, program understanding, reverse engineering UML diagrams, source code repository mining, along with educational purposes.  Additionally, there are a large number of download from industry.  A number of companies are using srcML to support various software analysis and exploration tasks.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan I Maletic"
