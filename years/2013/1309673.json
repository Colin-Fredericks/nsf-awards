 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTechnical Part:  This project will investigate and develop a new dynamic tissue engineering scaffold, harnessing state of the art knowledge in optical wave-front engineering, which will be able to produce diverse force types.  The work will focus on producing scaffolds that can generate engineered spatiotemporal mechanical forces using near infrared irradiation.  The three-pronged strategy that will be used in the fabrication of this dynamic scaffold system consists of (i) localized heating enabled by patterned illumination, (ii) an enlarged surface area resulting from pixelated post topography fabricated by imprinting technology, and (iii) an engineered comb-like porous structure with CNT reinforcement.  This dynamic cell-seeding niche can provide physical forces varying in time and space to mimic some aspects of embryogenesis in a manner not previously possible.  It will provide a platform for studying the effect of mechanical forces on cell fate.  For this study, the effect of mechanical forces on the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells along a hepatocyte lineage will be investigated for the first time.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Part:  The proposed new dynamic scaffold, harnessing state of the art knowledge in optical wave front engineering, will be able to deliver diverse forces to living cells.  It will help to improve our knowledge of the role that mechanical forces play on tissue development and regeneration, thus facilitating controlled stem cell differentiation into specific tissues and organs.  The platform can be extended for multiple cell type seeding in spatially predefined regions to facilitate stem cell differentiation.  Applying fundamental knowledge of materials synthesis, mechanical characterization, and optical manipulation to life science and health will broaden the appeal of materials science and engineering to the diverse UC Merced student constituency that includes large Hispanic and Hmong populations.  The grassroots outreach will include (i) a concerted effort to recruit nationally for underrepresented students by providing summer internship opportunities and encouraging participation in this research through independent study or a Materials Capstone Design course, and (ii) graduate students as well as faculty members giving public lectures and interactive presentations.",
