The main objectives of this collaborative project are to identify the primary causes of the irreversibility, to quantify the irreversibility, and to determine how best to include irreversibility into mesoscopic models of suspension flows. While there exists a general notion of irreversibility being caused by short-range interactions, the exact nature and magnitude of these interactions is unknown and, in many cases, various roughness models or repulsive forces are applied more or less in an ad hoc manner. As long as this fundamental research question remains unanswered, there is no fully satisfactory way to formulate any type of rheological model. The project will attempt to establish that a universal treatment of irreversibility must be scale-dependent. For relatively large particles (greater than, say,100 microns), the major cause of irreversibility in suspension flows is typically surface roughness. As the size of the particles decreases below 100 microns, it is hypothesized that there exists a transition in the major cause of irreversibility from surface roughness to nonhydrodynamic static forces which may include forces such as electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Furthermore, the project will establish that irreversible particle migration scales linearly with a measure of nonlinearity of the shear flow. The establishment of these hypotheses will have a strong impact on rheological models, which currently lack universality. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research directly affect several key areas of science and engineering, with many implications for everyday life. Suspension flows are important in a wide variety of evolving technologies including advanced materials processing, chromatography, encapsulation, microfluidics, secondary oil recovery by hydraulic fracturing, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and the transport of sediments, contaminants, and slurries, to name a few. Several rheological models have been developed over the past several years to help engineers develop effective processes involving suspensions. Although these models have been relatively successful in determining steady state concentration profiles, they fail to model the transient states. This research will remediate the shortcomings of the existing models. The research effort will be complemented with a strong educational and outreach component.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nParticle migration and dispersion in highly-viscous shear flow play an important role in a variety of industrial-relevant applications including composite materials processing, secondary oil recovery, and microfluidics to name a few, as well as environmental applications such as transport of sediments, pollutants and contaminants and viscous resuspension.  For highly viscous fluids, particle migration and dispersion are primarily the result of irreversibility within the flow field.  A principal outcome of the current research is to identify and quantify the main causes of the inherent irreversibility.  We have systematically investigated the relative importance of particle roughness and inter-particle static forces on particle migration and dispersion.  Since the hydrodynamic forces scale with the size of the particles squared while the static forces scale with the size of the particles, we have been able to show that particle roughness is the predominant source of irreversibility for larger particles while static forces are the predominant source of irreversibility for smaller particles.  The cross-over point is material dependent. \n\nWe have performed hundreds of thousands simulations of binary particle interactions in linear and nonlinear shear flows with both surface roughness and static forces (both attractive and repulsive).  We have characterized particle migration and dispersion as stochastic quantities depending on a stochastic surface roughness.  The results of these simulations have been used to explain characteristics of suspension flows including several experimentally observed phenomena.  We have been able to show that, for neutrally-charged particles, the in-plane and out-of-plane self-diffusivity is independent of the nonlinearity of the flow field.  However, we have shown that this is not the case for attractive and repulsive particles.  For attractive particles, the self-diffusivity decreases slightly with the nonlinearity of the flow field while for repulsive particles, the self-diffusivity increases slightly with the nonlinearity of the flow field.  We have also been able to show that particle migration increases linearly with the nonlinearity of the flow field.  This important fact (along with suspension slip at the wall) has been instrumental in explaining why particle migration scales with the particle size to the 2.7 power in dense suspensions.  However, this linearity does not exist for repulsive and attractive particles.  Finally, we have been able to explain the reversal of migration direction for both particles suspended in short period oscillatory nonlinear flows and for attractive particles in unidirectional nonlinear flows.  This phenomenon has been shown previously in experiment but a rational explanation has previously eluded investigators.\n\nWe have also investigated the effects of particle elasticity and the increase in fluid viscosity with increasing pressures in interstitial regions between particles.  These two phenomena can also cause irreversibility in suspension flows and are extremely important in elastohydrodynamic lubrication applications.  We determined that particle elasticity has little effect on interparticle forces if the results are normalized by the interparticle gap as opposed to center-to-center particle separation.  In general, there are four different relative particle motions.  The increase in fluid viscosity is only important for the motions of particles moving towards or away from each other along their line-of-centers.\n\nThe results of this research will be instrumental in further developing rheological models for suspension flows.  We continue to disseminate this research in presentations at national and international conferences, seminars, and through publications.  We have developed both new experimental apparatuses and numerical simulation capabilities, which will be instrumental in continuing this research into the future.  We have included a number of graduate and undergraduate students in this research.  Many of the undergraduate students have been actively recruited from the local chapter of the Society of Woman Engineers.  The students have imparted incredible enthusiasm and insight into this research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc S Ingber"
