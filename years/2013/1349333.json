LOM eworkshops will mphasize the research of the Center and utilize aligned technical examples for addressing translation components known to be important for research translation success relevant to the interests of the Center.  The workshops will serve as the basis for unique translation plans to be developed by each Center based on their research.  Lens of the Market Workshops have covered a wide range of materials,chemistry and engineering critical research topics.",
