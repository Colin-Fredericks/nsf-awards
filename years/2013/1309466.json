 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop a compact, practical, novel 3-terminal approach to sensing and distinguishing emissions gases using graphene's intrinsic single molecule sensitivity. This is to be accomplished using a subthreshold Silicon Carbide Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor with an active epitaxially grown graphene gate as the active transducer to provide performance advantages not possible with SiC and graphene alone.   \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in applying subthrehsold design principles to SiC devices, as well as to gas sensors, neither of which has been done to date. Furthermore, the modes of distinguishing between gases using a compact solid-state device will be investigated, a potentially transformative concept in the realm of gas sensing.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this include applications in harsh-environment sensing, emissions monitoring and low-cost gas-monitoring for homes. If successful, this will provide transformational low-cost solutions to these monitoring problems, some of which are currently un-enforceable. Finally, this effort will fund 3 professional 10-minute videos (by Co-PI & Emmy-nominated documentary maker L. Kissel) documenting the scientific process in this project for the layman, and to develop materials for recruitment of students into Science and Technology, Engineering and Math fields. This project will continue University of South Carolina's commitment to expanding diversity, by seeking to match the University demographic makeup with that of the surrounding counties, through recruitment of minority students. This project will involve at least 1 African-American PhD student.",

Our approach differs from previous ones in that instead of using graphene by itself, we used interfaces of graphene with another material, such as SiC (used for power switches), or MoS<sub>2</sub> (used in lubricants), to amplify changes in the electrical properties of the graphene by ~100x, leading to a corresponding improvement in the sensitivity of our sensors. This enabled &lt;1ppm NO<sub>2</sub> to be routinely detected, well below the 10ppm current enforcement capability of the EPA in day-to-day situations, where 10ppm exposure can cause respiratory issues. Achieving this required the development of new crystal growth techniques for graphene, SiC and MoS<sub>2</sub>, along with advances in the architecture of the electronic sensors. Finally, we were able to demonstrate a certain degree of selectivity i.e. the ability to distinguish between various other potential contaminants, such as ammonia, by applying a voltage to enhance or suppress a certain contaminant&rsquo;s electrical signature.
