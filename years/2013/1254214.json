 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists have long hypothesized that insects and pathogens are directly involved in the origin and maintenance of plant diversity, especially in the extraordinarily diverse tropical rainforests. The evolution of novel chemical defenses that deter insects and pathogens has been thought to allow plants to expand their geographic ranges, thereby promoting the formation of new species. Very little is known about the identity or distribution of the enemies that attack tropical plants or how host-specific they are. In this research, populations of 45 species from a common, diverse genus of tropical rainforest trees (Protium) in Peru, Brazil and French Guiana will be studied to learn about which insects and pathogens attack the plants and how the plants defend themselves. By simultaneously studying natural enemies, plant defenses, and the evolutionary history of plants, insects, and soil pathogens the investigators will gain new insights on the processes that generate high biodiversity in the Amazon basin.  \r\n\r\nThis project will train scientists both in Peru and the United States, with a focus on promoting opportunities for students from underrepresented socioeconomic groups. A summer field course in Peru will be developed for Peruvian and US students at the University of California at Berkeley, that will teach ecology, evolutionary biology, taxonomy of plants and insects, experimental design and research methods. This project will integrate research and education with international field biology and involve minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students will be recruited from an existing program at Berkeley that mentors first-generation college students, providing critical field biology opportunities for students who are generally offered only lab-based research positions.",

Each species of plant contains in its tissues dozens of different chemical defenses, and biologists have long puzzled over how this impressive chemical diversity has evolved. The most famous theory to explain chemical diversity in plants is that over evolutionary time when plants produce a novel chemical it could give plants protection from their specialist attackers (specialist meaning it consumes only one kind of host).&nbsp; The specialist in turn may experience a mutation to circumvent this defense giving it an advantage which will in turn spur the plant to produce yet another novel chemical, in an arms race. This theory (the &ldquo;escape and radiate&rdquo; theory) has been supported with some detailed studies, yet it is difficult to imagine how it explains the interactions between all of the defense chemicals and all of the dozens of different kinds of insects and pathogens that feed on any given plant species during the lifetime of a plant. In addition, plants and their enemies are not likely to have the exact same geographic distributions, so that important enemies in one part of a plants&rsquo; range would be different than in another part of a plant&rsquo;s range and should then select for different chemical defenses, which might also drive the evolution of chemical diversity in plants.</p>\n<p>In this project, we worked to characterize the complete chemical defense diversity and insect herbivore assemblages of the co-occurring species of a common tropical tree genus in two geographic locations: Iquitos, Peru and Manaus, Brazil which are separated by 1500 km. In Peru, we sampled 890 juvenile individuals from 32 species of <em>Protium</em> (Burseraceae). We surveyed each of these plants biweekly for 62 weeks and collected each of the insects we found feeding, resulting in almost 4500 feeding records. In Brazil, we sampled 300 individuals from 14 <em>Protium</em> species, 12 of which were the same species that we sampled in Peru. In Brazil, we surveyed each plant once a week for a year and collected all insects found feeding on them, a total of 966 feeding records.&nbsp;&nbsp; We collected leaves from each <em>Protium</em> species in Peru and Brazil and conducted a detailed chemical defense analysis, characterizing more than 600 different chemicals in all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We found almost 400 different species of insects, mostly hemipterans (planthoppers), beetles, and caterpillars. Over 90% of these insects were generalists, not specialists, and fed on many different species of <em>Protium</em> plants. However, each insect species displayed strong preferences for different species, based on their chemistry. Plant chemical diversity was extremely important for the plants, and the species of plants with the largest number of chemicals had the fewest number of insect species feeding on them.&nbsp; Next we wanted to know which chemicals were associated with which particular herbivores. To accomplish this, we applied machine-learning techniques that are widely used in computer science (like Google search) and genomics (associating genes with diseases) and we found that 81 chemicals were statistically associated with at least one insect herbivore. Of these some were attractive (suggesting the insect could detoxify it) and some were repellent. We found that repellent chemicals were found in many species while attractive chemicals were found in comparatively few.&nbsp; When we compared insects between Peru and Brazil we found no overlap in species composition, yet the chemical composition of the 12 shared <em>Protium</em> species was almost identical. In summary, we believe our results point to a new theory to explain the evolution of plant chemical diversity without specialist herbivores in a coevolutionary arms race.&nbsp; Plants express a lot of different chemical defenses because each chemical is only effective against a few enemies and the more that they have, the better chance they have to defend against different types of enemies across their entire geographic range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The educational goals for this project were to involve more minority students from the US in ecological research and encourage them to pursue graduate school and build capacity for international biology students. We involved 23 different US students in this project --20 of these were minority students, and 8 of these underrepresented. Three Latina undergraduates from Berkeley attended our Amazonian field course in 2014, and two of these students are currently in graduate school pursuing ecological and evolutionary biology research.&nbsp; Three Peruvian undergraduate students who attended our Amazonian field course entered and received Master&rsquo;s degrees from a Brazilian Research Institute (INPA-Manaus). &nbsp;By mentoring minority students to succeed in higher education and become leaders in their field, we can reach minority students earlier in their education, encouraging them to participate in science and higher education and hopefully build a fairer, more equitable society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul
