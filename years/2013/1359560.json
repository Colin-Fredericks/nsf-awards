This project represents a step-change for the industry in several ways: it provides a continuous, real-time stream of data, enables remote monitoring, and validates engineering models.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work would create a dataset that currently does not exist, and could be used not only by our customers, but also by insurers, risk analysts, financial investors, researchers, and consumers - creating value in complementary industries. The proposed technology will be able to impact customers in construction monitoring starting from early 2014, and with good traction, would be able to reach customers in the transportation, energy, mining, and other sectors within five years.",
