 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the potential for enhancing students' interest and ability in STEM disciplines by broadening fourth grade students' understanding and interest in the spatial perspectives inherent in geography and other science disciplines.  The study incorporates the latest developments in the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within the classroom. The project tests a set of hypotheses that posit that the use of GIS in the classroom results in a measureable improvement in students' spatial reasoning and motivation. Geography teachers in elementary schools are trained to use GIS software to create digital maps specific to the subject matter and projects on which their students work. Students then work in small collaborative groups and engage in open discussions designed to enhance the development and use of their spatial and multi-step causal reasoning.\r\n\r\nGIS has been used in middle and high school settings. This project introduces GIS to upper elementary grades particularly to allow students an early opportunity to be involved in meaningful data and map-driven activities to promote their spatial skills.  The proposal team predicts that the traditional gap between girls and boys in spatial skills will shrink with training thus will be strongly pronounced in the experimental relative to control groups. The project documents the effectiveness of instructional practices that are likely to enhance multistep reasoning, systems thinking, conceptual and spatial understanding, and motivation for learning while learning to work with maps to solve problems involving geography and ecological awareness. The project develops instructional methods that incorporate innovative tools for promoting problem solving to address real-life issues in this increasingly technology-driven era. The innovative tool is open-source and designed for professionals, but it can be modified to be child-friendly. Classroom activities are integrated with science and social studies curricula and content standards. Teachers are expected to find the curriculum attractive and easy to implement.",

Half of the classrooms were trained to use GIS during the fall semester while the other half served as controls, waiting to implement the GIS curriculum during the spring semester. Participating teachers, students, and administrators have responded extremely positively.

Our results indicated that the students who completed our GIS program outperformed the students in the control classrooms on two assessments: map-focused questions from the National Assessment for Educational Progress items and a standardized cognitive ability test. On a transfer activity, the GIS-trained students were able to mentally overlap four maps simultaneously to find precise solutions to a problem while the control students seem to have interacted with each map independently without a clear articulation of a solution. Moreover, the GIS-trained students outperformed the control students in the ability to connect and compare maps and locations, overlap maps, and realize spatial patterns. In one pilot study, the GIS-trained students reflected significant improvements in their thinking by integrating different factors that might impact a problem. In another, the GIS-trained students discussed spatial information that was both local and global and provided more explanations than the control students.

As we continue to explore our dataset, we look forward to further analyzing student interest and confidence in the use of technology and students&rsquo; ability to transfer what they learned into new fields.
