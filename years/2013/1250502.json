 "awd_abstract_narration": "On the continents, increasing modern demands on limited and climatically sensitive \"critical zone\" resources such as potable water and arable land motivate improved knowledge of past changes in global climate and their manifestation in the critical zone. An overall decline in ocean temperatures over the past 65 million years (Ma) was interrupted at irregular intervals by times of relative warmth. One interruption of special note on the continents was the \"middle Miocene climatic optimum\" (MMCO) about 15 million years ago. In particular, at a paleo-latitude of ~30\u00b0S, western Australia experienced widespread, intense, chemical weathering, which produced ancient soils characterized by pellets of the minerals goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) that are concentrated in vast ore-grade channel iron deposits (CID). Proposed measurements of the H and O isotopes in CID goethite and hematite, as well as radiometric (U-Th)/He crystallization ages of the goethite should produce a well-dated record of ancient subtropical continental temperatures and waters. In addition, measured concentrations and carbon isotope ratios of the Fe(CO3)OH component in goethite would yield soil CO2 concentrations and isotopic characteristics of oxidizing organic matter with their implications for ancient critical zone carbon cycling (e.g., biological activity). These data are also expected to yield the concentration of MMCO atmospheric CO2 and would provide \"ground truth\" for community use in model simulations of ancient climate.\r\n\r\nA published model predicts that the O isotope fractionation factor between crystallizing goethite and ambient water will transition from a low-pH (acidic) value to a high-pH (basic) value. A series of goethite synthesis experiments over a range of pH from 3 to 13 at different temperatures are proposed to test this model. Experimental knowledge of the pH at which the transition occurs would minimize the chance of misinterpretation of O isotope data from natural goethites and also yield the relative magnitudes of two rate constants important in the model.\r\n\r\nThe combination of a robust radiometric age of crystallization with stable isotope data from a single mineral (i.e., goethite) is rare and enhances its value as a rich source of paleoenvironmental information. The results from the studies of natural and synthetic goethites would be relevant to climatology, hydrology, and paleoecology, in addition to geochemistry. The proposed research would contribute to the development of human resources through the training and participation of a graduate student in dissertation research. In addition, participation of undergraduate students would provide hands-on experience in the performance of geochemical research and encourage pursuit of scientific careers. Results from this research would be published and integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught at SMU by the investigator.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreases in human population and economic activity are placing increasing demands on a variety of natural resources.  Ore-grade deposits of iron (III) oxides have special significance in this context because of the importance of iron and steel in the modern industrial era.  Iron (III) oxide minerals are natural rusts and are products of oxidizing chemical weathering environments found at, or near, the surface of the Earth (e.g., lateritic soils).  The minerals goethite (&alpha;-FeOOH) and hematite (&alpha;-Fe2O3) are the most common natural rusts, and improved knowledge of the conditions associated with their formation in iron ores could help us to understand the limits that natural processes place on the availability of such resources.  \n\nThe channel iron deposits (CID) of Western Australia are extraordinary accumulations of pellet shaped ooids and pisoids composed predominantly of goethite and hematite and are some of the most readily mined and smelted iron ores on Earth.  This study focused on ore-grade CID of the Robe Formation in Mesa J near the Robe River of Western Australia -- especially on the isotope geochemistry of the iron (III) oxides -- to probe into their antiquity and the environments in which they crystallized.  At present, Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) in the vicinity of Mesa J is about 400 mm/year (latitude 21.7?S; elevation &asymp; 178 meters; about 70 kilometers from the coast).  However, weathering intense enough to produce iron (III) oxide-rich lateritic soils occurs in environments with MAP in excess of about 1300 mm/year. This suggests that the CID ooids were formed in soils under climatic conditions that differed significantly from those of the modern location of Mesa J.\n\nUranium, thorium, and helium abundances in the CID ooids indicate that goethite crystallized about 7 million years ago (7 Ma) -- in the late Miocene.  Australian continental drift put Mesa J at a subtropical latitude of about 29?S at that time, and measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in the oolitic CID goethites reveal a late Miocene soil temperature of about 22(?4) ?C.  These data also suggest that much of the late Miocene rain in the vicinity of Mesa J was delivered by tropical storms with summer trajectories that extended into the subtropics of western Australia more often than they do at present.  The resulting wetter summers should have favored microbially mediated dissolution, recrystallization, and consequent relative enrichment of Fe (III) oxides in biologically active ancient soils. The oolitic textures may be indicative of this iron recycling.\n\nConcentrations and carbon isotope ratios of CO2 occluded as a minor Fe(CO3)OH component in oolitic CID goethites were measured as part of an SMU graduate thesis project. The 13C/12C ratios are among the lowest measured to date in natural goethites and are consistent with the existence of substantial biological activity in those late Miocene soils.  In addition, the concentrations of Fe(CO3)OH imply late Miocene subtropical MAP of 2000 mm/year or more.\n\nSummary\n\nOolitic goethite in the CID of Western Australia crystallized in a late Miocene subtropical climate that hydrogen and oxygen isotopes suggest was much wetter than modern, perhaps because of an increased frequency of tropical storms.  Data from a minor Fe(CO3)OH component in the goethite support the idea of a wetter climate that enhanced both silica dissolution and microbially mediated recycling of Fe (III) oxides, thus enriching the CID iron to ore-grade concentrations. The indicated recycling of iron (III) oxides effectively ended about 7 million years ago, when the CID became another legacy of Earth's remote past and a resource formed under circumstances different from modern. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Crayton J Yapp"
