 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor James Farrar of the University of Rochester and his research group will explore the collisions of free radicals and atomic or molecular ions, employing the velocity map imaging (VMI) method for product detection, using the instrument developed during the initial grant period.  By employing a pulsed supersonic source of free radicals such as CH3 and C3H5, and an electron impact or discharge source of low energy cations such as N2+, N+, C+, O2+, and O+, and anions such as H-, O-, O2-, and OH-, the VMI detection method will produce differential cross sections in kinetic energy and angle. Of particular interest are the bond formation reactions that yield C-C, C-O, C-N, N-O, and H-H bonds. For anionic reactions, free electrons produced by associative detachment will be detected. The experiments will produce information on the dynamics of reactions of low energy ions with free radicals, an area of ion chemistry with few extant examples in the literature.  The work will address the serious deficiencies of models for electrical discharges and the chemistry of planetary atmospheres that do not include ion-radical reactions.  A study of the H- + H associative detachment reaction will have important implications for astrophysics.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to characterizing the dynamics of these chemical systems, this research will provide a deeper understanding of reactivity patterns and a molecular understanding of the chemistry that takes place in reactive ion etching, and in atmospheric and extraterrestrial chemistry. The instrumental technique development may have impacts in various subdisciplines of chemistry, including mass spectrometry and ion imaging. The students and post-doctoral associates involved in this research will contribute to the national scientific and economic infrastructure through the development of new measurement technologies, new high value-added products, and the further training of scientific personnel.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project is to apply the detection method of Velocity Map Imaging (VMI) to the study of gas phase reactions occurring between mass-selected ions and hydrocarbon based free radicals in crossed molecular beams.  Very little information has been available for such reactions owing to the difficulty of producing reactants in sufficiently high concentrations.  VMI overcomes that fundamental limitation by allowing products formed in all velocity space element's to be detected in a single time window.  We have vetted the method by studying charge transfer and bond formation reactions between C+ and NH3, N+ and CH4, and O+ with CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I.  In all cases, product kinetic energy and angular distributions provided clear differentiation among possible chemical reaction products.  The experimental data were supported with Gaussian G2-level calculations of the structures and energies of reactive intermediates and barriers connecting them to establish plausible reaction pathways.  Subsequently, formation of the CH3 and C3H5 free radicals was accomplished with a pyrolysis beam source with number densities sufficiently high to allow velocity space images of selected reaction products to be observed.  Electron transfer and proton transfer reactions were obtained in the case of H3+ + CH3, and charge transfer and carbon-carbon formation reactions were observed in the case of C+ + C3H5.  Because of the low ionization energies of these free radicals, electron transfer products were expected.  However, the bond formation reactions were somewhat  unexpected, and indicated that they were competitive with electron transfer.  In the case of C+ + C3H5, experimental data and Gaussian calculations supported a mechanism in which the incoming C+ reactant forms a four-carbon cyclic species that decomposes by H2 elimination across a carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThis experimental and computational program provided the first dynamical studies of ion-radical reactions.  Such information has not heretofore been available to computational models, and is expected to have an important impact to such studies.  This program has provided important experience in reaction dynamics, mass spectrometry, ion optics, and particle imaging technologies for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty members in other labs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Farrar"
