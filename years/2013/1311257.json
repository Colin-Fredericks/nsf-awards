 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology, the timing of natural history events, is important to all organisms. Each spring, for example, butterflies and bees emerge to forage on freshly blooming flowers ? all examples of phenological events. Synchrony in these events is typically determined by changes in temperature or day length. Increased temperatures due to climate change have altered phenologies of plants and animals, in some cases causing \"mismatches\" between organisms that have historically emerged in abundance at the same times. These mismatches can have dramatic consequences for survival and reproduction, especially when one species depends heavily on another species for its success.  An example of this is the emergence of spring wildflowers before emergence of the insects that pollinate them.  The proposed experiment targets the mechanisms behind changes in plant reproduction due to altered phenology, and will contribute to the current understanding of how altered phenology affects pollination of native plants.\r\n\r\nPhenology is one of the most sensitive ecological responses to climate change, and changes in phenology are well documented. However, in the face of climate change, the lack of information on the effects of altered phenology on pollination is troubling. The vast majority of flowering plants, including many food crops, rely on insects or other animals for pollination, and pollinators provide an estimated $112 billion/year in ecosystem services; therefore, investigating how climate change could affect plants, pollinators and their interactions is critically important. The results of this study will provide insight into how a key ecosystem service will respond to variation in phenology associated with climate warming. In addition, the proposed research integrates teaching, mentoring, and field investigation and provides a field research opportunity for an undergraduate student.",
