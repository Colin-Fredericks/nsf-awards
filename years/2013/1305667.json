 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop a key microelectromechanical systems\r\n(MEMS) device necessary for low-power, low-cost, robust 2D GC. The specific objectives of this\r\nproject are to (a) develop a good understanding of the physics and chemistry governing the\r\nmicroscale thermal modulation based on theoretical modeling, (b) develop a new MEMS-based\r\nthermal modulator (microTM) device design such that it enables a 2D GC system that achieves\r\ntheoretically predicted maximum peak capacity and minimum peak breakthrough, (c) fabricate the\r\ndesigned \u00ecTM and experimentally characterize its performance, and (d) finally, demonstrate micrTM incorporating\r\n2D GC with the highest compound separation performance with optimal operational conditions determined.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: With the development of the microTM, our study will provide the first step towards\r\nfully implementing comprehensive 2D GC with MEMS technology. It is readily conceivable that the\r\nimproved separation power of 2D GC systems would pave the way for highly reliable and accurate\r\nin-situ monitoring/detection of VOCs in a sample even containing complex co-contaminant\r\nbackgrounds. This project will make important contributions to micro analytical instrumentation for\r\nultimate use in field-deployable GC analyses.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Together with cost effectiveness, complete elimination of consumables from the 2D GC\r\noperation with the microTM would fill the gap between the current relatively limited use and future\r\ngeneral use of the 2D GC technique in a wide spectrum of applications, potentially opening new\r\ncommercial markets. The fundamental knowledge gained from this research will be assimilated into\r\nthe PI's graduate course on MEMS and chemical sensing. Summer interns from underrepresented groups will be trained through synergetic\r\ncoordination with the NSF National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) program.",

Our modern society has seen a growing concern about human exposure to VOCs in air that may cause potential health risks. The on-site continuous monitoring or point-of-care detection of these compounds is believed to enable accurate environmental health risk assessment and the rapid, non-invasive, early-stage screening of human diseases.
