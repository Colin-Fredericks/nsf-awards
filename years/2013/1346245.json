 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programming multicore processors is a challenging task due to bugs resulting\r\nfrom concurrency and synchronization.  A fundamental reason for the difficulty\r\nis that current programming mechanisms require programmers to manually\r\ncoordinate synchronization between threads running on these systems.\r\nConsequently, concurrent systems are prone to bugs due to faulty\r\nsynchronization problems such as missing, wrong, or lost notifications for\r\nthreads.  Moreover, these bugs are hard to find during testing because they may\r\nappear only under a rare schedule of events.  Current programming mechanisms\r\nalso limit the amount of concurrency in threads to ensure that a shared\r\nvariable is not updated by multiple threads. As a result, many concurrent\r\nsystems slow down due to sequential bottleneck of accessing shared variables.\r\nThis project is expected to fundamentally change the way synchronization\r\nmechanisms (such as monitors) are written and implemented.  It will lead to\r\nbetter understanding of how conditions in a multithreaded program can be\r\nevaluated efficiently.  As a result, the concurrent programming systems will\r\nbecome more reliable and faster.  The impact on society is expected to be large\r\nbecause all new systems are based on concurrent programs.\r\n\r\nThe project is developing new synchronization mechanisms with two fundamental\r\ngoals. The first goal is to make synchronization as simple and intuitive as\r\npossible for programmers.   Current (monitor based) synchronization\r\nmechanisms require programmers to explicitly signal threads that may be waiting\r\non certain conditions. In the synchronization mechanism developed in this\r\nproject, there is no notion of condition variables and it is the responsibility\r\nof the runtime system to automatically signal appropriate threads.  Analogous\r\nto automatic garbage collection in Java, the project is designing efficient\r\nalgorithms and techniques for automatic signaling.  The project is\r\ninvestigating techniques to deal with fairness and exploitation of runtime\r\ninformation such as idle cores for effective and efficient automatic signaling.\r\nThe second goal is to increase the concurrency in implementation of monitor\r\nwithout requiring programmers to do any additional work and without violating\r\nthe guarantee provided by the monitor that execution of its methods is\r\nequivalent to one in which there is at most one thread in the monitor at any\r\ntime.  \r\n\r\nThere is also a strong educational component for this project.  Synchronization is a fundamental topic\r\nin computer science education and is taught in all operating system courses. By\r\neliminating manual signaling from these courses, students would get more time\r\nto focus on higher level concurrent programming concerns.\r\n\r\n",
