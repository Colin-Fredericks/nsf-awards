 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the evolutionary history of neosuchians ? living alligators, crocodiles, and gharials -- and their closest extinct relatives. Neosuchians have a rich fossil record on every continent spanning almost 200 million years. They were surprisingly diverse, including seagoing animals with flippers and sharklike tails, small crushing forms with anvil-like teeth, and 30+ foot giants. Many aspects of neosuchian evolution and diversity are unclear. This includes the exact number of extinct species, the interrelationships of the several lineages, the geographic origins of modern crocodylians, and the role large-scale earth changes, including changes in climate and sea level, played in shaping neosuchian biodiversity.  The investigators will examine specimens in museum collections around the world, including fossils and the skeletons of modern species, to assemble a comprehensive, precise history of neosuchians from their origins to the present.\r\n\r\nNeosuchians are one of the few groups of animals for which we can simultaneously collect data from every living species and sample a substantial amount of extinct diversity with fossils. This project will further develop the use of neosuchians as a model group for studies exploring and reconciling conflicts between data from living and extinct species. This, in turn, will improve techniques used to estimate divergence time from molecular data - something central to the modern life sciences. Because of their global distribution, neosuchians will also allow us to explore the interrelationships of diversity and climate over very long time periods. This, in turn, will improve strategies to conserve modern crocodylian species, some of which are gravely endangered.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on the diversity and evolutionary relationships of early crocodylians &ndash; alligators, crocodiles, and gharials &ndash; and their close extinct relatives.  The goal was to better understand the origins of modern crocodylian lineages, the sequence of character state changes that took place as crocodylians radiated, and how their current geographic distribution came to be.  Through this project, we have come to understand that the last common ancestor of living crocodylians did not look like a modern crocodylian; it resembled small, short-snouted early alligator relatives with crushing teeth.  There appears to have been a basic split between the lineage leading to modern crocodylians in North America and a radiation of similar forms &ndash; most of which were unnamed and undescribed before this project &ndash; in Europe.  The European group died out at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs and were replaced by early representatives of modern groups.  We also analyzed fossils from the Southern Hemisphere previously argued to be close to the ancestry of modern crocodylians; they are actually distantly related, suggesting that the conditions found in the ancestral crocodylian arose multiple times around the world.  This project resulted in the publication of 15 peer-reviewed publications (with several more approaching completion or under review) and 37 professional presentations, and it contributed to the completion of eight graduate theses.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher A Brochu"
