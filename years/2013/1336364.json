Plasma production in liquid water produces a host of advanced oxidation agents that have the capacity to rapidly decompose organic contaminants. The proposed effort investigates a novel method of producing plasma in bubbles immersed in water by driving them at resonance in the presence of an electric field. This effort studies the ignition physics of resonantly driven bubbles, the time evolution of plasma formation in such bubbles, and the chemistry of the active interfacial layer separating the plasma bubble and the liquid water.  The understanding gained from these studies will be used to design and build a plasma reactor for the purpose of water purification. As part of the educational outreach thrust of this effort, lab tours and demonstrations will be given to visiting grade school students from programs such as the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program and those sponsored by Women in Science and Engineering, using in-house fabricated plasma demonstration experiments.  In addition to sponsoring a student from the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), a program aimed at encouraging underrepresented students to attend graduate school, we will also integrate plasma demonstrations into the existing educational outreach effort led by the National Society of Black Engineers, which involves actually visiting at risk schools in the area for the purpose of inspiring students with hands on experiments, mini-lessons, and mentorship.",

Andrew Potter (Fall 2013 &ndash; Spring 2014), Alex Lampe (Fall 2014 &ndash; Spring 2015), and Kit Lewis (Fall 2014) designed and built a new coal powder feeding system for the gasifier.  Alex also designed and built custom dropout tanks for condensed water and particle separation.  \n\nAs part of this program, an outreach program with Red Rocks Community College students to participate in an 8-week summer research experience was developed. In 2015, I collaborated with Liz Cox (RRCC STEM Director) and Chuck Stone (REMRSEC REU Director) to integrate the RRCC program into the existing REU activities.  This program supported one RRCC student to do work in my lab in the summer of 2015 under the supervision of the PhD student supported by this grant, Madison Kelley.   Sean is co-author on two conference papers.\n\nInfrastructure outcomes\n\nThis grant supported the recommissioning and modification of a laboratory-scale gasifier for single-particle experiments.  A new particle feeding system was designed and fabricated for entrained flow studies. This configuration is reported in one journal paper and one conference paper: \n\nM. A. Kelley, et al., System overview and characterization of a high-temperature, high-pressure, entrained-flow, laboratory-scale gasifier, Review of Scientific Instruments, (2015) vol. 86, no. 5, p. 055106.\n\nM.

In collaboration with researchers at CU Boulder in Dr. Greg Rieker?s group, we demonstrated frequency-comb measurements of water vapor concentration and temperature at the conditions of the study.  (Manuscript in preparation) \n\nA new steam injection system and single-particle extraction probe was designed and fabricated for the single particle char kinetics studies.  This system allowed for precise particle reaction times and direct measurements of carbon conversion rates.  \n\nScholarly outcomes\n\nActivated carbon was selected as a char surrogate for the study.  Several activate carbon samples were selected and thoroughly characterized including samples from biomass and coal feedstocks.  This characterization of the initial char was an essential contribution of this study, as there is a lack of conversion studies with well-characterized initial feedstocks.
