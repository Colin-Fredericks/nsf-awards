 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award is partially funded by Energy,Power and Adaptive Systems Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate For Engineering, Control Systems Program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovations, in the Directorate for Engineering, Robust Intelligence Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Applied Mathematics Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. \r\n\r\nWhile we are witnessing a veritable revolution in bipedal robot construction technology, the science of balance, as embodied in the feedback control algorithms that allow these robots to stand, walk, and step over obstacles is still in its infancy. Current feedback algorithms demand laborious, time consuming trial-and-error tuning specific to each machine and each gait. If bipedal robots are ever to fulfill their potential roles from assisting the elderly or infirm in their homes to disaster and rescue response, their control software development process must be founded on better science.\r\n Intellectual Merit:  The project draws upon mechanics, MEMS devices, mathematics, and feedback systems to make a sea change in the practice of modeling and feedback control design in bipedal robots. The work seeks to advance scientific understanding of legged locomotion so that performance objectives can be tested mathematically for feasibility on reliable models and principled methods exist for model-based feedback controller design. The theoretical results of the project are being evaluated experimentally on a 3D bipedal robot at the University of Michigan.\r\nBroader Impacts:  Important medical applications of bipedal locomotion research include lower-limb prostheses and devices for the rehabilitation of walking and balance after injury. The PIs use their interdisciplinary work in mathematics, sensing, feedback systems, and robotics to promote STEM subjects. The researchers are actively involved in rapid dissemination including videos posted on YouTube channels, television programs, and weekly tour of their robotics laboratory.",
