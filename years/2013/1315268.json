 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Third Graduate Research Conference in Algebra and Representation Theory will be held at Kansas State University in April 12-14, 2013. The webpage of the conference is http://www.math.ksu.edu/events/grad_conf_2013  The conference will feature invited lectures given by experts in algebra and representation theory and 20-minute to 40-minute talks by graduate students. The keynote speakers are Professor V. Futorny (Universidade de Sao Paulo), and Professor E. Poletaeva (University of Texas, Pan American). There are several schools in the region with strong research traditions in algebra and representation theory, and participation of graduate students from those schools will support the development of their research programs. The range of topics in algebra and representation theory that will be presented at the conference is expected to be very wide and will include representations of finite groups, representations of Hecke algebras, symplectic reflection algebras, algebraic groups, quantum groups, quantizations, Lie algebras, Hopf algebras, Bethe subalgebras of integrable systems, cohomology over commutative rings, Langlands correspondence, unitary duals, vertex operator algebras, D-modules. The focus topic of the invited lectures is graded algebras, superalgebras, and their connection to representation theory.\r\n\r\nParticipation in the conference is open to a very broad audience. One of the main goals of the conference is to increase the interaction among graduate students from different universities. The conference provides the participants with the opportunity to communicate their research progress, to develop presentation skills, and to get acquainted with future colleagues. It opens connections for collaboration among future researchers. The event will be very beneficial for research projects on the level of graduate programs. Participation in the conference stimulates  research, helping to prepare results for Ph.D theses and publications.  In the long run, the conference will increase interest among students in US graduate programs and fundamental mathematical research, in particular in the programs offered in the Midwest region and by mid-sized universities.  The organization of the conference is undertaken by a committee of graduate students and one undergraduate student.  The event serves as training for a team of graduate students in organizing professional meetings in mathematics.",
