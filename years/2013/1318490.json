 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although neurons receive most of the attention in brain research, a second cell type, glial cells, comprise as many or more of the cells in the brain.  Astrocytes are a major type of glial cell.  These cells function to regulate brain metabolism, including the energy use of neurons.  Past findings from this laboratory and others indicate that glucose provision to the brain enhances memory functions.   Adult mammalian brains use glucose as the major source of energy.  This project will determine whether and how astrocytes regulate memory formation by controlling energy use in the brain.  The general hypothesis is that ECF glucose levels are sufficient to meet energy requirements under low-need conditions.  But when the need is greater, for example during activation to support more intense cognitive functions, astrocytes break down energy reserves stores to provide neurons with a rapid energy boost.  These experiments use new methods to measure brain energy substances in awake rats during memory testing, together with pharmacological treatments that identify the necessity of different metabolic routes during memory processing.   The role of brain energy metabolism in making new memories identifies a new set of biological processes that regulate the highest functions of the brain, opening new avenues for investigation of brain processes with potentially high impact in scientific investigations of the brain and its functions.  In addition to the scientific impact, the project will have direct impact on science education and training at the postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and K-12 level.  The PI has mentored students at all these levels and, relatively uniquely, includes high school students in the research team.  The PI will bring information from this research project to the public through regular participation in outreach programs to secondary school students and education forums for the elderly.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to test the hypothesis that astrocytes play a key role in regulating learning and memory processes.  The questions were framed within a multiple memory systems approach through which hippocampal and striatal memory systems in the brain could be compared. \n\n 1. Using biosensors and microdialysis, the experiments show that:\n\na) Levels of glucose and lactate in the extracellular fluid of hippocampus and striatum responded with increases and decreases during training on several tasks.\n\nb) Lactate increases in hippocampus and striatum were associated with canonically associated learning tasks, but the findings interacted significantly with reward on the different mazes.  These findings suggest that current multiple memory systems view is narrower than the results support, differing with not only the cognitive strategies used to solve tasks but also with the nature of the reward acquired during training.\n\nc) Hippocampal and striatal glycogen levels generally decreased when rats were tested on tasks canonically associate with each brain area.\n\nd) Inhibition of glycogen breakdown to lactate in astrocytes impaired memory on different tasks, and glucose and lactate each reversed memory impairments after inhibition of glycogenolysis\n\ne) Inhibition of the lactate transporter on neurons impaired memory these tasks and neither glucose nor lactate reversed memory impairments produced by inhibition of the neuronal lactate transporter. \n\nTogether, these findings suggest that lactate released from astrocytes enters neurons to regulate learning processes, perhaps by augmenting energy reserves. \n\n \n\n2. In female rats, estradiol enhances hippocampus-based learning and impairs striatum-based learning.  The findings are apparently the result of independent estradiol action at each brain area.  We examined glucose and lactate levels in both brain areas at different estradiol treatments in ovariectomized rats.  The findings show that glucose and lactate levels increase in the hippocampus with estradiol treatment but decrease in the striatum with estradiol treatment.  These results suggest that estradiol alters the availability of the metabolism substrates in a manner consistent with the behavioral findings.\n\n 3.  An unexpected finding was that initial training on place (spatial) or response (turning) versions of a 4-arm radial maze resulted in altered glycogen levels and in altered lactate release during new memory testing 30 days after the initial training.  These long-term changes in astrocyte neurochemistry and function may have implications for how one experience can alter learning and memory on later occasions.\n\n 4.  Using the long-term changes in glycogen as a basis, we examined long-term changes in behavior 30 days after an episode of exposure to drugs of abuse, morphine and cocaine.  The results indicate that morphine in particular shifts learning from hippocampus-dominant to striatum-dominant functions.  The brain samples are currently being analyzed for expression of proteins associated with lactate and glucose uptake.\n\n 5.  Aged rats exhibit impairments in hippocampus-based tasks but not in striatum-based tasks.  These results provide a way to use aging as a natural manipulation to test the importance of lactate and glucose to learning more generally.  We compared lactate and glucose responses to place and response learning in aged rats.  The findings show that the hippocampus has reduced training-related increases in lactate and glucose in aged rats, while these levels were maintained in young rats.  Moreover, glucose and lactate infusions into the hippocampus enhance learning and memory.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul E Gold"
