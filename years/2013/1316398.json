 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a large-scale (4,000 students, 32 teachers, 5 classes per teacher per year); cross-sectional (four grade levels); and longitudinal (three years) study aimed at understanding and supporting the teaching of science and engineering practices and academic language development of middle and high school students (grades 7-10) with a special emphasis on English language learners (ELLs) and a focus on biotechnology. It builds on and extends the pedagogical model, professional development framework, and assessment instruments developed in a prior NSF-funded exploratory project with middle school teachers. The model is based on the research-supported notion that science and engineering practices and academic language practices are synergistic and should be taught simultaneously. It is framed around four key learning contexts: (a) a teacher professional learning institute; (b) rounds of classroom observations; (c) steps-to-college workshops for teachers, students, and families; and (d) teacher scoring sessions to analyze students' responses to assessment instruments.\r\n\r\nThe setting of this project consists of four purposefully selected middle schools and four high schools (six treatment and two control schools) in two Georgia school districts. The study employs a mixed-methods approach to answer three research questions: (1) Does increased teacher participation with the model and professional development over multiple years enhance the teachers' effectiveness in promoting growth in their students' understanding of scientific practices and use of academic language?; (2) Does increased student participation with the model over multiple years enhance their understanding of science practices and academic language?; and (3) Is science instruction informed by the pedagogical model more effective than regular instruction in promoting ELLs' understanding of science practices and academic language at all grade levels? Data gathering strategies include: (a) student-constructed response assessment of science and engineering practices; (b) student-constructed response assessment of academic language use; (c) teacher focus group interview protocol; (d) student-parent family interview protocol; (e) classroom observation protocol; (f) teacher pedagogical content knowledge assessment; and (g) teacher log of engagement with the pedagogical model. Quantitative data analysis to answer the first research question includes targeted sampling and longitudinal analysis of pretest and posttest scores. Longitudinal analysis is used to answer the second research question as well; whereas the third research question is addressed employing cross-sectional analysis. Qualitative data analysis includes coding of transcripts, thematic analysis, and pattern definition.\r\n\r\nOutcomes are: (a) a research-based and field-tested prototype of a pedagogical model and professional learning framework to support the teaching of science and engineering practices to ELLs; (b) curriculum materials for middle and high school science teachers, students, and parents; (c) a teacher professional development handbook; and (d) a set of valid and reliable assessment instruments usable in similar learning environments.",

LISELL-B tested and revised a pedagogical model, professional development framework, and assessment instruments that were developed in a prior NSF-funded exploratory project with middle school teachers of science to English learners. The LISELL-B project explored how science and engineering practices and disciplinary language practices can be synergistic when taught simultaneously. The setting for the project consisted of five purposefully selected middle schools and the five high schools fed by those middle schools (with eight treatment and two control schools) in two Georgia school districts. The study employed a mixed-methods research design to answer three research questions: (1) Does increased teacher engagement with the project's professional development framework enhance teachers' effectiveness in integrating the teaching of scientific practices and disciplinary language practices?; (2) Does increased teacher enactment of the project's pedagogical model change the interactions of teachers and students as they work to enhance their use of science practices and disciplinary language practices?; and (3) Is science instruction informed by the project's professional learning framework and pedagogical model more effective than regular instruction in promoting English learners' ability to engage in science practices and their ability to express their emergent understandings using the language of science?<br />To answer the first question, image 1 shows the percentage of teachers enacting each of the six LISELL-B pedagogical practices per week, by implementation level and project year. The findings indicate that for three of the four science investigation practices in our model the majority of project teachers became medium or high implementers, however, the majority of teachers remained low implementers for the fourth practice (Controlling Variables to Design a Fair Test). For the two practices focused explicitly on the language of science, the majority of teachers became high implementers. Thus, we conclude that our teacher professional learning framework was effective in supporting secondary grades science teachers in integrating the teaching of scientific practices and the teaching of disciplinary language practices as they learned to work with increasing numbers of English learner students.<br />To answer the second question, image 2 shows the distinctions we found between traditional ESOL practices that were common with our teachers at the start of the project (left column of figure 2) and the evolving practices that teachers in the LISELL-B project were more likely to enact after participation in the LISELL-B project (right column of figure 2). We found that the shift from the earlier practices (referred to as First Generation Sheltered Instruction) to the new, emergent practices (that we refer to as Next Generation Sheltered Instruction) improved the interactions between teachers and &nbsp;English learners in ways that enhanced their integrated use of science practices and disciplinary language practices.<br />To answer the third question, we conducted two different types of text analyses (latent Dirichlet allocation [LDA] and systemic functional linguistics [SFL] approaches) to detect latent language patterns in students' written responses on LISELL-B constructed response assessments. We found that students' responses clustered into three distinct latent language patterns: Pattern 1 consisted primarily of responses using everyday language, Pattern 2 consisted primarily of responses using general academic language, and Pattern 3 consisted primarily of responses using discipline specific language. Students' proportions of language use changed from pre-test to post-test, shifting from pattern 1 to patterns 2 and 3, indicating a clear response to the LISELL-B intervention. That is, students in LISELL-B classrooms, including English learners, changed the language they used on science assessments as they learned new science and language practices from their teachers. &nbsp;<br />The intellectual merit of the LISELL-B project was that it allowed us to better understand the interactions between science and engineering practices and disciplinary language practices. Our research led us to propose new models for integrating these practices and new frameworks for professional learning to prepare science teachers to more equitably support all of their students, including English learners (see Image 2 and Image 3). The broader impacts of the LISELL-B project included capacity building to pursue related questions that are critical for meeting the changing goals of science teaching and learning with a changing student demographic. Our analyses also suggest lessons about the potential benefits of bilingual constructed response assessments. We found that student responses often contained useful pedagogical information beyond what could be extracted from rubric-based scores. Thus, assessments that are more educative for teachers and students can push systems to be more equitable and coherent in meeting the needs of all students, including English learners.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Buxton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014675753_NGSIpractices--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014675753_NGSIpractices--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Next Generation Sheltered Instructional Practices\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014675753_NGSIpractices--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Next Generation Sheltered Instructional Practices\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Transition from traditional ESOL practices that were common with teachers at the start of the project (left column) and the evolving practices that LISELL-B teachers were more likely to enact after participation in the project (right column).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buxton & Caswell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Buxton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Next Generation Sheltered Instructional Practices</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014469123_Teacherenactmentofprojectpractices--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014469123_Teacherenactmentofprojectpractices--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teacher engagement in project practices\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543014469123_Teacherenactmentofprojectpractices--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher engagement in project practices\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The percentage of teachers enacting each of the six LISELL-B pedagogical practices per week, by implementation level and project year.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buxton & Caswell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Buxton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teacher engagement in project practices</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543298297860_CS-SFLmodel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543298297860_CS-SFLmodel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Culturally Sustaining SFL Framework\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1316398/1316398_10256506_1543298297860_CS-SFLmodel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Culturally Sustaining SFL Framework\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LISELL-B emergent framework for integrating science and language practices in culturally sustaining ways with English learners.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiang, Harman & Buxton</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Buxton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Culturally Sustaining SFL Framework</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
