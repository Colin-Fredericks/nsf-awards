The conference will be held July 1-5, 2013, in Budapest, Hungary, in the historical building of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. There will be only invited talks by outstanding mathematicians who will create a scientic program with intellectual merit on a par with Erdos's incredible research achievements. Invited speakers who have accepted our invitation include several winners of the Fields Medal, Wolf Prize, Nevanlinna Prize, and other major prizes. One of our underlying goals, in addition to honoring Paul Erdos, is to bring together these exceptional researchers and study the relationships between their work and Erdos's work. We are confident that the meeting will inspire new insights and further collaborations from these \"mathematical giants\". There is no doubt that Erdos's work will continue to be the source of beautiful developments in mathematics and in other fields.",
