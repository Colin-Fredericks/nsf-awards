The goals were two-fold: first, investigate problems in combinatorial commutative algebra and computational algebraic geometry that arise from the theory of graphical models, and second, develop statistical methodology for graphical models using algebraic geometry. \n\nFor this project, the PI and co-authors studied Gaussian graphical models, statistical models used in biological applications; statistical network models, models used to capture edge formation mechanisms in social and biological networks; and biochemical reaction networks, deterministic models used in systems biology.\n\nIn terms of Gaussian graphical models, the PI and co-authors used algebraic matroids to connect a statistical invariant of the models, the maximum likelihood threshold, to rigidity theory, a field motivated by problems in engineering.  \n\nIn terms of network models, the PI and co-authors developed a new goodness-of-fit algorithm for log-linear network models.  This will allow researchers from sociology to neuroscience to test whether a particular model of edge formation fits their data.  This new algorithm was based on concepts in combinatorial comuutative algebra.\n\nFinally, in terms of biochemical reaction networks, the PI and co-authors describe a procedure for parameter estimation and model selection for such networks.  The method applies numerical algebraic geometry to the model selection problem with effective results.\n\nAs far as broader impacts are concerned, one part of this project was to develop software for statisticians and researchers in other fields based on the ideas and theories from algebraic statistics.  To this end, the PI was a co-author of the software package that makes it easier to use numerical algebraic geometry techniques within existing computer algebra programs.\n\nAdditionally, this award allowed for new collaborations to be built.
