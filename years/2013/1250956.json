 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although big data has had a huge impact in several areas, this impact is limited by the high cost and poor quality of analyzing unstructured data, and the costs of integrating data of multiple types. Lowering these costs will bring the benefits of big data based research to many new areas. Against this background, this project aims to develop machine-learning methods that read, analyze, and integrate web-scale collections of text and other data. The project can be expected to yield fundamental advances in data integration, machine learning, natural language understanding, and automated inference. \r\n\r\nThe project includes research thrusts in (1) robust semi-supervised bootstrap learning algorithms that can cope with ambiguity in text, (2) algorithms for detecting and aligning the schemas implicit in semi-structured sources relative to a shared common ontology, (3) NLP algorithms that perform deeper analysis on text to extract infrequently mentioned yet important facts, and (4) targeted reading agents  capable of pursuing specific queries or conjectures based on the scientist's current focus. \r\n\r\nAnticipated results of the project include fundamental advances in each of the research thrusts and their synergistic integration into software system (NESSIE) designed to help scientists in exploring scientific hypotheses in their respective domains of interest, by supporting targeted extraction of knowledge from large amounts of textual  sources in relevant areas. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the research include advanced techniques for  extracting and organizing structured knowledge from text, and integrate the learned information with existing structured knowledge in multiple domains. The Additional broader impacts of the research include enhanced opportunities fore advanced research-based training of graduate students. The softare and data resulting from the research will be made freely available to the larger scientific community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany scientific enterprises could potentially be leveraged by extracting an appropriate \"big data\" resource from documents on the Web.  The goal of this grant is to make it simpler and easier for scientists to collect this sort of data.\nOne successful approach for extracting data is called semi-supervised learning (SSL).  Older learning approaches for extracting information from the web required many labeled examples, which are expensive to generate in technical and scientific areas (because the examples need to be produced by scientists or engineers in the right area).  SSL allows accurate learning with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples.  One outcome of this grant was a new SSL system, based on the idea of \"graph embeddings\" from the field of deep learning, which outperformed previous SSL systems.  This approach also leads to embeddings which better reflect the true labels of the objects being classified: the first image below shows a visualization of three embedding techniques used on the same data, with the new technique shown in the center.\n\nAnother issue with SSL systems is that, it is often possible to improve performance by incorporating appropriate heuristics (as we ourselves showed in recent papers.)  This is good - but it is quite hard for even an expert in machine learning to understand and predict what heuristics will work best for a given problem.  Another outcome of this grant was a new, declarative framework that allows one to rapidly explore a large space of possible SSL tricks, and combine them automatically.  The second image below shows the improvements obtained on one domain using this technique.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Cohen"
