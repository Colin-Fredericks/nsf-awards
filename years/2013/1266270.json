 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop Optical Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer (OMUT) technology for high-resolution imaging probes mountable on a tip of a needle or small diameter tubing. The design relies on laser generated ultrasound and optical detection of ultrasound. Therefore all signal communication to and from the device is optical. Ultrasound is generated by rapid absorption of short laser pulses in a thin film. Optical micro-cavity resonators having a flexible top membrane form high sensitivity ultrasound detectors.\r\n\r\nThe two key features of OMUTs, miniaturization and all-optical connectivity, make it an ideal technology for medical applications such as real-time guiding of cardiovascular interventions, laparoscopic surgery, and deep brain electrode implantation. Another added value of this technology is the facilitation of pulse/echo ultrasound imaging and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a single device. Combining ultrasound imaging and PAI provides a range of possibilities for the design of multi-modality, functional, and molecular imaging systems for higher specificity in medical diagnosis and therapy guidance.",
