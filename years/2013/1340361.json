Biomimetic surfaces, nanoparticles, and even large three-dimensional scaffolds are able to capture the chemical and physical properties of certain biological systems, from nanometers (size of proteins and drug carriers), to microns (mimicking whole cells), to centimeters in length (modeling tissues).  This biomimetic approach aims to detect invasive disease at early stages, to identify and image its location within complex, dense tissues, to identify novel drug targets, and to deliver therapeutics or contrast agents to a specific region.  As with all new biomedical tools, variations in the unique properties of these materials (size, topology, functional moieties, mechanics, and chemistry) directly impact their interaction with the biological medium and surrounding environment.  The importance of controlled design and fabrication and subsequent characterization of the materials will be emphasized.  \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Part:  This symposium brings together an international group of investigators in the synthesis of functional materials, surface chemistry/coatings, and identification of targeting agents to share their findings and insights from a variety of perspectives.  The attendance of eight new and/or young investigators will be supported by $500 travel awards.  Awardees will be selected by the symposium steering committee based on the abstracts of presentations proposed by attendees.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2013 MRS Fall Meeting  is the world's foremost international scientific gathering for materials research and showcases leading interdisciplinary research in both fundamental and applied areas, coordinated by over 200 scientists from both academia and industry in 19 countries around the World.  The meeting's core is its technical program which inlcuded 51 symposia organized into six toical areas. \n\nEvery year, this is a well-known national meeting with large dissemination through many mechanisms (mailings, school postings and social media).  The specific Symposium I session on Multiscale Materials in the Study and Treatment of Cancer was announed alongside the national mailings; and it was also announced through personal networking avenues by the four symposium organizers.\n\nThe objective of the symposium was to include both invited and contributed sessions in all topical aspects of using materials to either understand how cancer works or toward treating it.  The organizers sought to highlight those in the field that combine materials and cancer biology research, as well as invite materials experts to consider working in or collaborate with others in the cancer field.  The success of this session was in its ability to integrate these areas and foster discussion among diverse groups of engineers, scientists, and biologists, across all career stages, and across international borders which were equally featured in Symposium I.\n\nTravel funds provided by NSF helped defer the expenses of new and young investigators (graduate students, post-docs and assistant professors) who otherwise would not have the funds to attending the conference.  The meeting organizers found the most meritous abstracts from the poll and awarded them travel reimbursement.\n\nThe organizers are extremely grateful to the NSF for its support.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
