 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to explore theoretical ideas in mathematics and computer science that are related to quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory that, notably, requires a new model of probability theory that can be called quantum probability, and this in turn leads to the theory of quantum computing and the possibility of building quantum computers.  The project will investigate quantum algorithms (algorithms that could be run on quantum computers) for problems in topology, for example determining whether two knots are equivalent or different.  The project will also investigate quantum error correction (a new kind of error correction that would be needed by quantum computers) in the setting of a new kind of geometry, \"quantum metric spaces\", in which distances are defined in the language of quantum probability.  Finally the project will explore quantum algebra, which is a kind of modern algebra with non-commuting variables also inspired by quantum mechanics and which has relations to quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis project will have at least two and potentially three broader impacts.  First, all work will be disseminated on the arXiv, a widely used preprint server that includes most work in quantum computing, and the principal investigator will help support the arXiv.  Second, the project will include development of lecture notes, which could be made into a future graduate textbook, on quantum probability, quantum computing, and quantum mechanics.  Third, if quantum computers are ever build, they will have an extremely broad impact, and the ideas in this project will play a role.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project explored methods and problems in mathematics and computer science that are inspired by quantum mechanics.  Results were obtained that shed light on quantum computation and quantum information theory, and other work was initiated in this topic as well.  Other results were obtained, and other work was initiated, in topics in computational geometric topology where there has been renewed interested in part due to the possibility of quantum algorithms.  Both positive and negative results were obtained, indicating both the power and limitations of quantum and non-quantum algorithms.  Finally a topic was pursued concerning the geometry of planar tensor networks as they arise in quantum algebra.\n\n\nIn the topic of quantum computation, we refined two fundamental results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem and Aaronson's theorem on post-selected quantum computation.  The former is one of the main constructions that makes quantum computation theoretically possible.  The latter illustrates one of the ways that quantum computation is surprisingly more powerful than classical computation.  We also showed that the quantum fault tolerance theorem, which is the summary theorem that anchors optimism that quantum computation is possible, still works when sources of quantum error spread insidiously and contagiously among qubits.\n\n\nIn the topic of computational geometric topology, we showed that a basic invariant of 3-dimensional manifolds, namely counting their finite covering spaces, is computationally intractable in large cases, even though it is widely used in small examples.   The methods for this classical result were inspired by universality results in quantum computation.   We also found a candidate problem, distinguishing special 3-manifolds known as lens spaces, that has a good quantum algorithm, although in the end a competitive classical algorithm was also obtained.  We established a first upper bound on the computational difficulty of distinguishing general 3-manifolds.  All of these results shed light on the still-open problem of finding a superior quantum algorithm for any natural question in computational geometric topology.\n\n\nYet other results were also obtained on both the geometry side and the quantum side.   All results were posted to the arXiv, and the project helped support five graduate students.  Finally, a project was restarted to make a computer-assisted reference source for relations between pairs of computational complexity classes, including in particular quantum complexity.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory J Kuperberg"
