 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brian A. Korgel from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry in research focusing on new chemical routes to silicon- and germanium-containing nanocrystals, nanorods and nanowires with precisely controlled dimensions.  Novel reaction pathways are being developed to provide exquisite control of reactant decomposition, semiconductor formation and crystallization, and effective surface passivation.  For the study of quantum confinement-related optical and electronic properties, silicon and germanium nanomaterials in the quantum size range are synthesized with the ability to manipulate shape and chemically passivate surfaces.  Silicon and germanium-containing iron chalcogenides, Fe2MS4 (M = Si, Ge), are also being synthesized and studied for photovoltaic applications, as new photocatalyst analogs to the earth-abundant semiconductor, pyrite FeS2, or \"Fool's gold\" and as alternative electrode materials for next generation lithium ion batteries.\r\n\r\nSilicon- and germanium-based nanomaterials have a variety of applications in energy storage and solar energy utilization.  Specifically, they have applications in medicine, for transistors and displays, as electrode materials in lithium ion batteries, as novel photocatalysts, and as photovoltaic devices.  The silicide and germanide compounds targeted in this study represent a new class of photocatalysts and light-absorbing films in photovoltaics made of earth-abundant materials.  This project also supports the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, along with additional educational activities that include visits and demonstrations to local primary and secondary schools, teacher training, and undergraduate education efforts involving nanotechnology, such as the development of a new freshman course on commercialization and innovation, team-taught with colleagues from the business school.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSilicon is one of the most widely used semiconductors, finding applications in solar cells, computer chips and optical detectors.  It is a very good material for shuttling electrons around and converting photons into electrical signals.  It is not, however, a good light-emitter&mdash;unless the crystal size is on the nanoscale.  Because of quantum confinement effects, such silicon nanocrystals emit light with high efficiency and wavelengths that can be tuned by crystal size from the visible into the near infrared.  This project, \"Silicon and Germanium-Containing Nanocrystals, Nanorods and Nanowires,\" focused on the development of new synthetic methods to produce nanomaterials of silicon and its underlying (on the periodic table) cousin, germanium.  A variety of outcomes were achieved.  Highly uniform silicon and germanium nanocrystals were made and assembled into superlattice structures.  These superlattices might have a variety of applications, including quantum computing.  Small angle X-ray scattering measurements on superlattices with in situ heating revealed that the silicon nanocrystals are unusually stable, up to temperatures as high as 350C.  Most other types of nanocrystals degrade at much lower temperatures of ~200C.  Different surface functionalization strategies were developed to dock chromophores and polymer-forming monomers.  The first ligand exchange was demonstrated for silicon nanocrystals, using labile alkanethiol capping ligands.  A convenient and useful room temperature hydrosilylation method was discovered that uses ester and acid-containing molecules to activate the reaction.  New synthetic methods for controlling the silicon nanocrystal shape were also developed, to produce the first example of light-emitting silicon nanorods.  Silicon-germanium heterojunction nanorods were also made by extending these methods to germanium.   A variety of previously untested silicon reactants were also explored and extremely low temperature approaches to silicon nanorods were established.  Crystalline silicon nanorods could be grown colloidally at temperatures lower than 250C.  The research has significantly expanded the synthetic toolbox for both silicon and germanium nanomaterials and provided new insight about the influence of quantum confinement on the optical properties of these materials.  The project has also opened new avenues for using light-emitting silicon nanocrystals for medical applications and biological imaging.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian A Korgel"
