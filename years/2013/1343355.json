 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental operation for users in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to access the spectrum is channel rendezvous. After rendezvous is established, channel information exchange and propagation among users are also essential for efficient spectrum access. Existing studies on channel rendezvous in CRNs have limitations and are unsuitable for efficient access scenarios. Additional information about users can help generate intelligent designs in CRNs that can shorten spectrum access delay. However, due to practical constraints, such information is extremely difficult to obtain before rendezvous is established. Mining the social patterns of CR users (or secondary users, SUs) and intelligently utilizing the captured social information is a promising approach. The objective of this project is to design, analyze, and evaluate fast and efficient spectrum access schemes for CRNs without a common control channel. One unique feature of this work is the consideration of SU social patterns and the incorporation of social analysis to enhance spectrum access efficiency. The approach involves analyzing the time, location, and spectrum-dependent social patterns of SUs; identifying and addressing new challenges in channel rendezvous, security, and recommendation designs with the assistance of SU social analysis; and proactively utilizing social patterns of SUs for fully distributed fast and secure spectrum access design. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a significant impact on efficient spectrum access. Social analysis of users is a critical component to further enhance spectrum access efficiency and accelerate CRN deployment. This interdisciplinary research is potentially transformative as it will help generate innovative techniques to numerous CRN applications. It will also greatly enhance the understanding of social interactions of mobile users in wireless networks. This project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate research students to gain valuable educational training and research experiences. The research results will be presented at IEEE/ACM journals and international conferences.",
