Participants in this symposium will discuss challenges associated with bringing in sync the development of new research methodologies and an accelerated pace of new materials discoveries with slower evolving textbooks and curricula.\r\n\r\nRecently, President Obama announced the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) and this program specifically champions the development of materials through the collaboration of computational science and experimental design.  The marriage of these two requires researchers with cross-disciplinary skills, and this educational symposium 2013 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Franciso will explore new methods for the training of future scientists and engineers for the MGI.",
