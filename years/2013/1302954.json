 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bevin A. Zauderer is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Harvard University.  The fellow's program utilizes radio observations of extremely energetic transient events to probe conditions in the early Universe and to illuminate their underlying physics.  The fellow will execute an intensive observational program of the most energetic transient astrophysical phenomena in the Universe: gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes.  These transient events release large amounts of energy in high velocity outflows, which approach the speed of light in some cases.  As these outflows interact with the gas in the immediate surrounding environment, synchrotron emission is produced, which generally peaks at radio wavelengths.  Radio observations from hours to months after the initial discovery provide unique and crucial information on the energy and geometry of these explosive events as well as the surrounding environment.  The fellow will use world-class observatories to lead the rapid radio followup: the Very Large Array, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy, the Smithsonian Submillimeter Array, and the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array.  The fellow will measure the radio brightness of these transient events as a function of wavelength and time and will produce rich data sets to supplement the optical, infrared, and high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray observations.  These radio observations will be synthesized to study the composition of the high-velocity outflow ejecta in gamma-ray bursts, to improve our understanding of the special population of gamma-ray bursts found at extreme distances in the early Universe, to determine characteristics of the environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole, and to determine how often relativistic outflows are formed in supernovae and tidal disruption events.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will undertake an educational program that will focus on the public's misconceptions of the concepts of her research involving high energy astrophysics, supermassive black holes, relativistic jets, and extremely distant galaxies.  The fellow will work with a leading science educator in the Harvard Science Education Department to hone her skills teaching and communicating science, particularly to address common misconceptions.  Her education and public outreach will have a broader impact in public policy through her work at the National Academy of Sciences on a report or workshop related to understanding and mitigating scientific misconceptions held by the public at large.",

The research program utilized radio observations (sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelength) of a carefully selected sub-sample of these three types of transients to probe conditions in the early Universe, study obscured star formation and the composition of jets with relativistic ejecta (speeds close to the speed of light), constrain density and energy of typical short GRBs, examine outflow velocities of GRBs with an associate supernovae, and understand how and when jets form in tidal disruption events.  \nGamma-ray bursts are especially useful for studying conditions in the early Universe because they are the most energetic events in the Universe, giving off an extreme amount of energy in a short amount of time: a bright beacon in space, allowing study of the star's distant and faint host galaxy's composition (which would be impossible otherwise).

Our research concludes that compact object mergers are consistent with radio observations, and in conjunction with optical and X-ray observations, constrains the opening angle of the resultant jets and hence the expected rates of short GRBs and their progenitor compact object merger rates.  This is relevant in the coming years as compact object mergers (such as the merging of two neutron stars) are also a leading progenitor for the creation of detectable gravitational waves in the coming years.\nAnother type of transient which produces a jet is the tidal disruption of a star as it is ripped apart when it wanders too close to the supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy if the gravitational tidal forces exerted on the star exceed the star\u00c6s internal forces which normally hold it together.  It had been predicted that tidal disruption would occur and lead to a stream of material yielding optical and X-ray flashes.  However, our research identified the formation of a relativistic jet from the tidal disruption of a star, an extremely interesting finding as other jets emanating from the centers of galaxies have typically been \"on\" for millions of years (in sources known as active galactic nuclei or AGN).  After the discovery of the first radio emission from tidal disruption, our research project obtained followup observations of other candidate tidal disruption events to help understand how often jets are formed and what leads to the formation of the jet.  In the past year, this research project discovered radio emission from a new tidal disruption event originally discovered at optical wavelengths, ASASSN-14li.  This research project continues to study the first tidal disruption event (Swift 1644+57) with a relativistic outflow at both radio and X-ray wavelengths, observing for the first time in such a source a jet turning on and shutting off.  \nIn all, this research project resulted in radio and X-ray observations of transient sources in these categories resulting in 15 publications (with three more in preparation).  The research led to many successful observational proposals, including 120,000 seconds with the Chandra X-ray observatory and a large 200+ hour program on the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico.  The published papers include:\n\n\n\"Discovery of an outflow from radio observations of the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li\"\n\n\n\"A Decade of Short-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Broad-band Afterglows:  Energetics, Circumb..."
