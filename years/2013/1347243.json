 "awd_abstract_narration": "This WIDER planning project is examining teaching, learning, and co-curricular evidence-based practices (EBPs) among underclass STEM majors and faculty at Otterbein University. Through an interdisciplinary initiative led by STEM practitioners and educational experts, the project is seeking to understand factors that influence the use and effectiveness of evidence-based practices for STEM students. These factors include faculty members' knowledge and use of EBPs, barriers to implementation of EBPs, and impact of EBPs on student learning and retention, as well as the role of student confidence and culture on learning and persistence. The team is using a rigorous, mixed-method design that employs a combination of validated assessment methods, classroom observations, focus groups, and data mining, focusing on gateway courses for majors in Biology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Zoo & Conservation Science. The mixed-method design is informed by multiple change theories, including Senge's model of learning organizations, and the results are being used to develop strategies for change at both the individual level (i.e., developing reflective teachers and disseminating curriculum and pedagogy) and the organizational level (i.e., enacting policy and developing a shared vision). The goal is to drive strategic, comprehensive reforms to the STEM programs at Otterbein and also to disseminate findings to other primarily undergraduate institutions in order to improve student learning and retention in STEM fields.",

In particular, many Otterbein STEM faculty employ teaching practices supported by research (evidence-based practices, or EBPs).  This study examined the extent to which EBPs are employed across STEM departments, the nature of the experiences of math/science students within and beyond the classroom, and factors influencing student persistence in STEM majors.  This was done to inform anticipated reforms of Otterbein STEM programs to improve student learning and retention.\nThrough an interdisciplinary initiative led by STEM practitioners and educational experts, researchers examined the state of faculty practice, student learning, student culture, persistence, and contextual factors influencing them. A rigorous, mixed-method design employed a combination of validated assessments of student motivation and content understanding, classroom observations, surveys, focus groups, and data mining. Additionally, researchers conducted an analysis of faculty members? knowledge and use of EBPs, barriers to implementation of EBPs, and impact of EBPs on student learning. Researchers also examined the role of student confidence and culture on learning and persistence. \nFaculty demonstrated considerable knowledge of EBPs, and reported in a survey, on average, using eight different evidence-based teaching practices per course.  Despite these high levels of reported EBP use, classroom observations indicated that faculty lectured 59% of the time and students passively listened or took notes 83% of the time.  Moreover, faculty accurately described their own classroom behaviors, but were less able to accurately describe student activities and experiences.  Part-time faculty used fewer EBPs compared to full-time faculty.  Examination of laboratory manuals and syllabi indicate the use of mostly prescriptive laboratory experiences with little student input into development of problems, procedures, or methods.  This led to a pilot effort to increase student input into laboratory exercises, resulting in measurable but limited improvements.  This effort continues.\nBased on research-validated test scores, gains in conceptual understanding were low across departments, and end-of-semester conceptual understanding correlated only weakly to course grade.
