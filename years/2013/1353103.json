 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will build and validate a set of 6 pH and nitrate sensors for profiling floats that will be deployed in the Southern Ocean. These sensors, from MBARI, will be integrated with floats supplied by the University of Washington Float lab. In addition to the pH and oxygen sensors, the floats will also carry fluorescence optode oxygen sensors together with biooptical sensors for chlorophyll fluorescence and backscatter. Each float will operate for approximately 330 profiles from 1700 m depth to the surface. This should equate to a 5 year endurance at profiling intervals near 7 days. The profiling floats will be deployed along the decadal CLIVAR P16S cruise, scheduled to leave New Zealand in March 2014. The P16S line will go north from the ice edge along 150 degrees W. Three of the floats with chemical sensors will be deployed at latitudes where there should be seasonal ice cover and three will be deployed to the north of the ice covered ocean.\r\n\r\nThe pH data collected by the floats should provide one of the first records of the annual cycle of pH in a region that is expected to become undersaturated with aragonite as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase. This will allow a unique assessment of the ability of current generation climate models to predict ocean pH trajectories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis is an EAGER grant, funded to prepare 6 profiling floats with biogeochemical sensors for use in the NSF-funded Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Models (SOCCOM) program.   These 6 floats were funded so that the field work could begin in advance of the actual start date of the SOCCOM grant itself.   The role of the University of Washington (this grant) was to purchase the float components and some of the sensors, to integrate other sensors supplied by MBARI (Dr. Ken Johnson, a co-PI on this grant, received a separate award), to fabricate the floats and sensors, including the MBARI-built sensors, to deploy the floats, and to begin the analysis of the data.   It was realized that within 2 years the data from these floats would become a part of the much larger SOCCOM float dataset and would be analyzed in conjunction with this larger dataset rather than examined separately.   During the first year of the project the floats were built and deployed along GO-SHIP section P16S, across the South Pacific.  One of the floats ceased operation after 8 months, on or around 8/19/2014.  The other 5 floats worked well and are still returning high-quality data today, in mid-2017.   These early floats were a good proving ground for the SOCCOM floats with a complete suite of sensors and showed that the general concept of biogeochemical profiling floats was valid.   During the period relevant to this Project Outcome Report the float data were monitored on a regular basis, they were quality controlled by the MBARI group, and the first analysis of the data were begun, just as the first regular SOCCOM floats were being deployed.  This grant was extremenly important for getting ready for the full-blown SOCCOM deployments in the sense that float construction, deployment, and analysis procedures were finalized during this 2-year period using these floats.\n\nMost of these floats found their way under the seasonal ice cover in the Antarctic during this year and showed that the ice-sensing algorithm installed on the floats worked as designed.   This software had been installed on many regular Argo floats since 2008 and had worked well, but this was the first test of the ice avoidance software on biogeochemical floats.   The fact that it worked flawlessly allowed SOCCOM to begin without concern about collecting data under winter sea ice.   As a result, we now have collected several thousand profiles of biogeochemical data under sea ice using these EAGER floats and the SOCCOM floats that came later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen C Riser"
