 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of fire research to date has focused on the negative impacts of large, medium-to-high intensity burns, which typically cause massive combustion of litter and organic matter in the topsoil followed by increases in soil erosion, runoff, and loss of nutrients. The positive role of fires in vegetation succession and nutrient cycling also is well recognized. In contrast, low-intensity burns (with soil temp. of  <220 degrees C) are presumed to cause minimal soil degradation and landscape/ecosystem alteration. As a result, there has been only limited research investigating potential negative consequences of such burns, although they account for almost half of total burned areas in the United States. Furthermore, climate change is expected to increase the frequency and area of land exposed to such low-intensity burns. Recent long-term studies on the effect of low-intensity fires on soil structure, however, are revealing that substantial loss of soil aggregate stability and porosity occurs several months to a few years after the burn has occurred. These degradations in soil structure often are followed by reduced infiltrability and increased soil erosion. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to investigate the impacts of low-intensity fires on soil structure and the implication for soil hydrology, erosion, and nutrient dynamics. Specifically, this project is designed to test three hypotheses: a) soil structure deterioration is caused by micro-scale stresses created within aggregates due to rapid vaporization or thermal expansion of soil particles as well as preferential volatilization of mostly hydrophilic simple organic molecules; b) disaggregation and subsequent surface sealing result in reduced infiltration and increased erosion; and c) preferential mobility of nutrient-rich dislodged fine aggregates and particles results in accelerated loss of nutrients and carbon via lateral and vertical transport. The proposed research will be conducted using soil samples collected from arid and semi-arid ecosystems in eastern Nevada and will mimic characteristics of past low-intensity burns of the region.\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of how low-intensity fires can lead to land/ecosystem degradation will benefit society by enabling more effective design of controlled burns as well as post-burn land management practices. This knowledge also can play an important role in planning for mitigation of the effects of low-intensity fires in sensitive ecosystems and landscapes of arid/semi-arid regions that are expected to experience more fires as a result of climate change. This research will expand on-going collaboration with the Bureau of Land Management, thereby facilitating adoption of new advances to support science-based resource management. In addition, this project will provide educational and advanced research training to one Ph.D.-level student and one postdoctoral researcher. ?Science boxes? will be employed to engage K-12 students in results of the proposed project.",

However, the possible adverse effects of low-intensity fires have not attracted the attention it deserves.&nbsp;The objective of this research was to investigate the stability of soil aggregates and the vulnerability of soil organic matter, which are essential indicators of soil resilience and ecosystem health, under low-severity fires. We were guided by three hypotheses. First, the pressure created within soil aggregates during low-intensity fire due to the rapid vaporization of pore water can cause substantial degradation of weak soil aggregates. Second, the disaggregation causes substantial loss of hydrologic function. Third, disaggregation causes a rapid loss of soil C by exposing organic, which was previously protected within stable aggregates, to microbial degradation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These mechanisms are of particular concern to weakly structured soils that dominate arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, we collected soil samples for this study from two distinct ecosystems that experience low severity fires in the western US: a sandy loam soil from an undisturbed pine forest in Mariposa County (CA) and a loam soil from unburned shrubland near Las Vegas (NV). The primary requirement for testing our hypotheses was to isolate the effect of rapid water vaporization from all other heat-associated factors. For this purpose, we subjected soil aggregates to varying degrees of temperatures at rapid and slow heating rates. While both approaches apply the same level of heat, the former mimics real fire conditions. This rapid heating, in turn, causes the pore water to boil faster and create pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We conducted two sets of studies. In the first, we used custom made precision pressure sensors to monitor the status of pressure within individual soil aggregates (see attached photo of the experiment). We also measured the tensile-strength (resistance to breakage under tension) of aggregates. We conducted a series of experiments involving varying sizes of soil aggregates, water content, and burn temperature. This experimental design allowed us direct access to monitor the internal pressure rise within aggregates during the simulated burn time (lasting 10-15 minutes). We observed that moderately wet soil aggregates generate substantial pressure that exceeds their cohesive strengths. In contrast, dry aggregates subjected to identical temperature profiles did not experience a similar increase of pressure within. We concluded that the ability to generate steam rapidly is an important mechanism that causes soil degradation under low-intensity burns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the second, we investigated the effect of a low-severity fire on soil organic matter (SOM), water-extractable organic carbon and nitrogen, as well as microbial respiration rate. We exposed soil aggregates to three heating regimes: no-heating, rapid heating, and slow healing. The final temperature and total heat load of the latter two regimes were identical. We conducted heating experiments under moist or dry conditions. We found that initially moist soil aggregates that were rapidly heated up degraded the most, showing increased cumulative carbon mineralization when compared to all other combinations. This observation was consistent with the first set of experiments. It suggests that deterioration of soil aggregates exposes organic carbon physically-protected within the soil aggregates to microbial consumption. For soils from the forested site, where the aggregates were naturally more stable, we observed delayed onset of accelerated organic matter loss by three weeks. This unusual soil respiration pattern is consistent with the previous conclusion: the exposure of protected organic matter is the primary mechanism of carbon loss under low-severity burns. We also observed that in the shrubland soils with a low degree of aggregation and organic carbon content, low severity burns can induce microbial lysis. Subsequently, the release of quickly biodegradable microbial debris facilitates the loss of soil carbon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This finding has important practical implications. Generally, practitioners and researchers treated low severity fires as low-risk occurrences due to relatively low temperature and duration of the fire. Therefore, these results warrant further investigations, as low severity burns constitute the majority of fires in the US. Furthermore, resource managers conduct controlled burns when the soil has some moisture for safety and ease of control. However, our finding suggests that wetness increases soil vulnerability to degradation under low-intensity fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This call for awareness was articulated in a widely circulated blog post by a cooperative extension advisor at the University of California, Agricultural and Natural Resources Division (https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=28173).
