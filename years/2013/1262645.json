 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California and the University of California Davis are awarded collaborative grants to create methods and software to generate maps from genomic data, as well as to solve the related problem of placing samples of unknown origin on the map.  Organisms that are more closely related to each other have more similar genomes.  Often, an organism and its relatives live fairly nearby, so in principle genome similarity between many different organisms can be used to construct a map of the local geography.  In this map, distances correspond to how easy it is for the organism to travel; so the map will display the landscape \"as the organism sees it\".  Specifically, the methods developed here will construct these maps in a way to allow optimization of several different criteria, and will use randomized algorithms for pattern identification to allow efficient computation on large genomic datasets.  The other, related suite of methods will use emerging tools from geostatistics to place other individuals on these maps, with rigorously quantified uncertainty. \r\n\r\nThe description of geographic patterns from genomic data, and location of unknown samples, will have many applications.  These tools could be used to identify the origin of a newly invading parasite, or to identify key barriers dividing the range of an endangered species. They will be of interest for inferring ancestry, and might be used to locate, for instance, the likely home of a person's grandfather to within 100km or so. They can also be used to visualize the relationships between modern populations; for instance, of humans, whose modern distribution reflects a complex history of large- and small-scale migrations; or of other species for which we often know little about their migration ecology. The simple, interactive, animated graphics developed as part of this proposal will help give researchers a new way of displaying information\r\nand contribute to the field of next-generation data visualization. To further enable effective communication of genetic results, short workshops will be offered both locally and at national meetings, with the post-doctoral fellow and/or graduate students hired through this proposal taking a leading role. The resulting tools will be distributed and discussed at http://ralphlab.usc.edu/ and http://gcbias.org/.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goals of this project were to develop new tools for geographically explicit modeling, visualization, and analysis of geotagged genomic data.  Throughout this project, we developed new theory, prototyped new exploratory techniques, developed new inference methods, and produced high-quality, open-source software tools.\n\nIt has been known for some time that genomic data (and a good enough reference panel) is sufficiently to roughly place an individual's location on the globe (if their recent ancestors did not move long distances, etcetera).  This, and related visualization using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has become one of the most widely used steps in exploratory data analysis of genomic data.  However, these inferences derive from relationships to others in the reference panel, and these relationships change as one moves along the genome.  In other words, the descriptive plots obtained from PCA (that often mirror geographic maps) are only a single summary of a quantity that could be highly variable.  One outcome of this project has been a method (implemented as well-documented software) to explore and summarize this variation.  Application of the method to various datasets turned up novel and informative patterns, including strong signals of segregating chromosomal inversions.  The method has subsequently been used to discover and describe regions of the genome underlying significant variation in a number of traits (e.g., coral bleaching).\n\nAnother important possible use for spatially explicit genomic data is to estimate geographic maps of population sizes and movement rates for species in which these are unknown.  As part of this project, we studied how assumptions of commonly-used method to do this (resistance distance-based methods) can give wrong answers, and developed an alternative method that does not make those assumptions.  Our main results were that historical directionality to migration - as for instance after a range expansion - could significantly bias the results of widely-used \"resistance\" methods, and showed that our method could remove these biases.\n\nWe have also developed a collection of related methods that use genetic data to describe the relationships between genetic relatedness and geographic space, for instance: (a) identifying major barriers to gene flow; (b) visualizing relationships between individuals in a spatial context; and (c) describing the results of a recent secondary contact between populations across geography.  These methods have become widely used in the empirical literature, with the last method aiming to replace STRUCTURE, which is one of the most widely used methods in empirical population genetics but is known to be misled by geographic structure.\n\nCollaborative applied work as part of this project on conservation of desert tortoises has led to substantial new methodological advances with implications beyond geographic modeling.  As part of that work, we developed new methods to simulate whole genomes from large populations distributed across geography. The methodology that we developed to do that, using a new data structure, the tree sequence, has been very successful, making it possible to run simulations 50-100 times larger than was previously feasible.  This new ability to simulate more realistic data promises to substantially increase reproducibility and reliability of genomic inferences.\n\nFinally, we have developed additional theoretical results describing how genes are expected to mix across landscapes, which is important in identifying situations when ongoing natural selection is contributing to spatial differentiation.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter L Ralph"
