 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) is in its 9th year. This year's meeting will be held at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, an emerging research university that has invested substantially in the development of research and educational programs in Bioinformatics since 2004. The International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) will contribute to the rapid dissemination of latest research results and to foster the formation of collaborations between researchers with the multidisciplinary expertise required to analyze the enormous datasets accumulated in modern biological research. The conference content will encompass diverse topics from comparative and functional genomics, to systems biology, to population biology and genetics.  ISBRA will provide important formative experiences to graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, helping them to become future leaders in the field. In 2013, when other popular bioinformatics conferences are being held outside the US, ISBRA will provide a valuable opportunity for resource-limited U.S.-based students and PIs to present research and interact with colleagues.",
