They will build a reference collection of specimens and their DNA.  Using both DNA sequences and anatomical features, they will discover and describe new species, investigate their evolutionary history, and produce an online interactive key.\r\n\t\r\nMany armored scale insects are invasive pests, costing an estimated $2 billion per year in the US.  Many of these pests can feed on an extraordinarily large diversity of plants, and are probably native to areas with high plant diversity such as tropical rainforests.  However, the armored scale insect fauna of tropical rainforests is unknown.  In a pilot study, the investigators found that several of these worldwide pest species are common in a Panama rainforest canopy.  These may be some of the most abundant herbivores on earth.  This project will investigate them for the first time in their probable ancestral habitat, and will likely discover other species that are not yet invasive pests but that are likely to become invasive pests in the future.  At the same time the investigators will develop tools that will enable inspectors to identify these pests if and when they show up in plant quarantine.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nArmored scale insects include many pests of gardens, orchards, and greenhouses.  They are probably the most invasive group of insects in the world, with about one new species becoming established in the US every year.  What makes them so invasive is that almost every plant has armored scale insects on it, but they are small and hard to see so usually they go unnoticed.  (One of the reasons you aren't allowed to bring fresh fruit into the US in your luggage is that it probably has armored scale insects on it.)  Another thing that allows some armored scale insects to be invasive pests is that they can eat an enormous diversity of different kinds of plants -- an ability called \"extreme polyphagy\".  Although we know a lot about armored scale insect pests in human-altered habitats, we know very little about armored scale insects in natural environments.  We hypothesized that extreme polyphagy evolved in environments with very high plant diversity, such as tropical rainforests, and that it is correlated with large population size.  In this project we sought to test these hypotheses by travelling to tropical rainforest study plots in 4 different regions (Panama, Australia, Malaysia, and Gabon) and collecting armored scale insects from identified trees and shrubs representing more than 700 plant species.  Our goals were to identify them to species using both traditional anatomical characters and DNA; to record what host plants each species used; to estimate their relative populations sizes; and to illustrate and describe any new species we discovered.  With this information we aimed to test the connection between extreme polyphagy and population size; to develop tools for molecular identification of armored scale insects; and to distinguish between pests, potential pests, and non-pests.
