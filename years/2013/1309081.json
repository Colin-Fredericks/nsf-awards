 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study knot and link concordance and its implications for 3- and 4-manifolds. We will study the smooth concordance classes of topologically slice knots via the recently defined bipolar filtration, using techniques of gauge theory, Heegaard Floer homology and von Neumann signatures. We will attempt to exhibit a primary decomposition of the knot concordance group using noncommutative localization techniques. We will also study the set of concordance classes as a metric space, under several natural metrics. We will also establish new structure in the knot concordance group, a sort of Wang sequence, arising from the failure of several conjectures of Kauffman.\r\n\r\nIn its broadest terms this project is about the mathematical structure of the \"shape\" of 3- and 4-dimensional objects. Understanding complex shapes has many applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is crucial to drug development. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is important in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes. The geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data (satellite imaging, sensor networks) has important military and commercial applications. Additionally, this project will increase the participation of U.S. citizens, permanent residents and women in mathematical research and education. This project focusses on knot theory, which is known to parametrize all 3-dimensional manifolds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis overarching goal of this proposal was to learn more about knot concordance.  Briefly, a knot can be thought of as a piece of rope or string that is tied up in space (3-dimensional) and they are thought of being the same if one can deform one into the other without cutting the string.  A link is just like a knot but may have more than one component.  Knots and links are extremely important in the study of low-dimensional topology (the study of shapes and spaces in dimensions 2, 3, and 4 where we think of two spaces as the same if one can be bent and twisted into the other, the so called rubbersheet geometry).  In particular, we can represent every three and four dimensional space as \"surgery\" on a link in Euclidean 3-space, R^3).  In turns out that if one wants to study 4-dimensions (space + time), it is essential to study knots up to concordance, where we are allowed to deform knots in 4-dimensions as long as the deformations are well behaved. \n\nThe way that this was approached was in the followingways.  \n\nIf one considers the set of all knots up to this 4-dimensional equivalence relations, it forms an algebraic object called a group, called the knot concordance group, written as C.  Not much is known about this group, which is quite complicated.  In order to better understand C, we studied it as a metric space (where one can measured the distance between any two points) and showed that under certain metrics, one could start to see some sort of fractal struture on C; that is, it has some self-similarities that get smaller and smaller as they are iterated.\n\nNext, it was recently shown by the original PI of the award (Cochran) that a 35 year old conjecture of Kauffman, based on Levine's philosophy, was false.  During this award, Cochran and collaborator investigate the failure of the philsophy of Levine, using cut-open null-bordism.  \n\nWith one of the research assistants, Cochran found shake concordant knots that are not concordant. \n\nThe graduate student and postdoctotal research assistants made substantial contributions.  \n\nThey\n\nmade connections between knots bounding Casson towers and an important filtration of C called the bipolar filtration;\n\nstudied the effect of satellite operations on the Upsilon invariant of Ozsvath-&shy;Stipsicz-&shy;Szabo;\n\nstudied Milnor's invariants and derivative from the Seifert surface of a knot;\n\nfound new ways of constructing slice knots;\n\nstudied the effect of string link infection on knot concordance;\n\nand determined an obstruction to a when a quasipositive knot can be the closure of an n-stranded braid. \n\nBroader impact: \n\nThe award supported a conference \"Topology in Dimension 3.5\" bringing together the world's experts together to discuss and work on the biggest open problems in knot and link concordance (many of which were outlined in this proposal).
