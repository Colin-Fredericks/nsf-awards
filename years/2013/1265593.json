 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to address long-standing fundamental problems concerning the emergent properties of correlated electron fluids using well-controlled methods of theoretical physics. The PI will investigate properties of electronic systems through a careful analysis of the behavior of simplified models of interacting electrons defined at the lattice scale. The PI will explore generic properties of interacting electronic systems and also attempt to gain insights into material specific features of strongly correlated electronic systems through the inclusion of salient features of the electronic structure of interesting materials. The PI will pursue a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. The PI will study the behavior of simplified models of interacting electrons in the weak-coupling limit where controlled, perturbative renormalization group calculations are possible and asymptotically exact results can be obtained. In order to broaden the scope of the physics accessible by these methods, fine-tuned electronic structures will be investigated. This amounts to studying the properties of the phases and phase transitions in the vicinity of quantum multicritical point.\r\n\r\n2. Near a quantum critical point, electronic properties can often be described by a quantum field theory. A particularly successful use of quantum field theory in correlated electron systems has been the use of Chern-Simons Landau Ginzberg theory to describe quantum Hall systems. This approach implies a profound analogy between the properties of quantum Hall systems and the properties of superconductors. The PI will study the justification and limits of applicability of the Chern-Simons Landau Ginzberg theory, and further explore the consequences of the implied analogy between superconductors and quantum Hall systems.\r\n\r\n3. Specific aspects of the properties of certain correlated materials can be addressed in terms of models that capture some essential feature of their local electronic structure. The goal is mainly to gain insights into the physics of one experimentally interesting material or another. A good example is provided by the newly discovered antiferromagnetic insulating state of Cs3C60; because it is insulating, it can be studied by expanding about a Mott insulating state in which the number of electrons on each C60 molecule is fixed by the effective Hubbard interaction. Understanding which further interactions dominate in this strongly correlated limit, and how they determine the nature of the ordered states may shed light on the interactions that give rise to superconductivity of this material under pressure, and in the broader family of superconducting materials A3C60, where A is any of a number of alkali metals.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the properties of correlated electron fluids may lead to the ability to exploit novel materials properties to develop new devices and technologies that derive their operating principles from the novel phases and phase competitions that occur in highly correlated electron fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports research and education with an aim to advance understanding of materials with electrons that interact strongly with each other giving rise to new states of electronic matter with interesting and unusual properties.  The broad thrust of this research is to gain insights into the nature of the states of electronic matter that emerge in strongly interacting materials. The PI will use simplified models for electrons in materials to examine the relationship between solutions obtained from controlled theoretical methods that assume that electrons are effectively weakly interacting to results obtained by various other methods.  \r\n\r\nSuperconductivity is one kind of emergent state of matter which is characterized by the ability of conduct electricity without resistance or loss of energy. The PI will explore an interesting connection between the fundamental physics of superconductors and the seemingly very different state of matter known as the quantum Hall effect. The quantum Hall effect arises when a two-dimensional layer of electrons, which can exist in an artificially layered semiconductor material, is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.  The PI aims to exploit knowledge of superconductivity to gain new insights into the fundamental physics of the quantum Hall effect.\r\n\r\nThe PI will also investigate the superconducting state that emerges in a material composed of the element cesium and a molecule of carbon containing 60 atoms which exhibits superconductivity under pressure. Experiments reveal properties that are qualitatively similar to those of the high temperature superconductors and other materials with strongly interacting electrons. The PI's study of this recently discovered superconductor may lead to insights into the nature of superconductivity in the high temperature superconductors.\r\nUnderstanding the properties of correlated electron fluids may lead to the ability to exploit novel materials properties to develop new devices and technologies that derive their operating principles from the novel phases and phase competitions that occur in highly correlated electron fluids.",

a phenomenon we have named \"intertwined orders.\" &nbsp;It appears clear that the complexity of the phase diagram, including the existence of broad difficult to characterize regimes of fluctuating order and sensitivity to quenched randomness, reflec the fact that the same correlations which promote one form of order (for example, high temperature superconductivity) appear unavoidably to cause a tendency to others (for exmaple, charge-density wave (CDW) or nematic order i.e. order that spontaneously breaks the point group symmetry of the crystal).</p>\n<p>An example of this complexity is shown in Fig. 1 which is a sketch of a phase diagram for a hole-doped cuprate high temperature superconductor, showing some of the types of order and fluctuational regimes suggested by a variety of experiments. &nbsp;In particular, the intertwining of CDW and nematic order with high temperature superconductivity is a piece of the physics - long anticipated in theoretical work of the PI - that has only been established experimentally in the past few years. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The past grant period has seen substantial fundamental progress - in the form of theoretical well-controlled solutions of explicit paradigmatic model problems of strongly interacting electrons - in obtaining an understanding of why such systems have such a hard time deciding how to order, how the interplay between different orders produces novel physical regimes that cannot be easily understood as deriving simply from one dominant ordering tendency, and what the role quantum critical phenomena play as an organizing principle for understanding a portion of this physics. &nbsp;The remaining figures present representative results of these calculations. &nbsp;Figs. 2 and Fig. 3 show, respectively, the results of numerical and analytic studies of a system tuned to the neighborhood of a metallic nematic quantum critical point, showing both that the quantum critical regime is extremely broad (Fig. 2) and that superconductivity is induced by the nematic fluctuations (Fig. 3). &nbsp;Fig. 4 shows the results of a model problem of coupled 2-leg Hubbard ladders which exploits the special theoretical tools that are available for the solution of even strongly interacting quantum systems in one spatial dimensional. &nbsp;Here, the interplay between superconductivity and CDW ordering not only results in the existence of multiple phases with comparable ordering temperatures, but it results in large regions of the phase diagram that exhibit various sorts of non-Fermi liquid behavior -
