 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing open-source tools for converting LaTeX documents into interactive course materials.  For students, who are now surrounded by interactive media, such materials are increasing demand for active learning and are leading to gains in educational outcomes.  For researchers, the platform is providing quantitative data addressing the ongoing debate between pure and guided discovery and the debate over the effectiveness of inquiry-based and constructivist pedagogy. Since many STEM researchers and STEM educators  are comfortable with using the near-ubiquitous markup language LaTeX, this project is making it possible for these content experts to broadly disseminate their scientific understanding and engaging course materials in a compelling and interactive way.\r\n\r\nThe project is enhancing the infrastructure for research and education.  For example, using the platform, a researcher is able to measure exactly how much time and in what way a student engages with the various components of an interactive activity.  From this data, the researcher is gaining insight into student learning, while the content author is receiving valuable feedback about what activities are particularly effective.\r\n\r\nThe project is being evaluated from the point-of-view of an industrial or UX (user experience) designer, addressing questions of author and student experience.  The resulting content authoring tools are available as open-source software on the web.  To ensure broad dissemination and to increase user expertise, a five-day workshop is providing training to content authors.",

These workshops provided professional development for instructors interested in using Ximera in their classroom, trained authors to produce interactive online textbooks, and organized software developers who extended the capabilities of Ximera.&nbsp;

For instance, the students using the Ximera-based textbook were more likely to report that the textbook was \"readable\" as compared to the students using the closed-source textbook.&nbsp; Before and after the course, students were asked about their confidence in their mathematical abilities and their enjoyment doing mathematics;
