Free probability theory is a probability theory adapted to deal with variables having the highest degree of noncommutativity. It is based on replacing independence modeled on tensor products by independence modeled on free products. The theory has important connections with von Neumann algebras, random matrices, combinatorics, and certain problems in mathematical physics. Surprisingly, the part of basic classical probability theory for which there are free probability analogues is unexpectedly large and keeps growing. The program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
