 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating a potential connecting link in the early Paleozoic tectonics of the southern and northern Appalachians.  Whereas accretion of terranes derived from Laurentia and Gondwana is recognized as the main cause of early to middle Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation to the north and south, neither exotic terranes nor major collisions with Laurentian blocks have been recognized in the Piedmont between central Virginia and the New York City area.  Nevertheless, these central Appalachian rocks record pervasive and intense early to middle Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation, leading to uncertainty about both the causes of this orogenic activity and how to link early to middle Paleozoic accretion through the northern, central, and southern sectors of the Appalachians.  Preliminary data from one sample from the Piedmont of central Maryland suggest that an exotic terrane may be present in this part of the central Appalachians.  The main goal of this research is to take the first steps in pursuing this discovery: to confirm the presence of the exotic terrane and begin to define its spatial extent.  The primary tool will be U/Pb ages from detrital zircons obtained from ten samples along strike to the north and south of the discovery sample.  Because detrital zircon U/Pb ages by themselves do not unambiguously rule out a Laurentian source, research team members also will use Hf isotopic compositions in zircons, acquired in situ, to probe Laurentian versus Gondwanan sediment sources.\r\n\r\nThe new isotopic analyses acquired as part of this research may provide prima facie evidence for a spatially extensive exotic terrane in the central Appalachian Piedmont, filling much of the central Appalachian gap.  This result would force a revision of our understanding of the tectonics of the central Appalachians, with implications for correlations along the entire orogen.  Geologists would have a new explanation for the intense and pervasive early to middle Paleozoic deformation and metamorphism of Piedmont rocks in this region.  Further, it would be possible to link in detail collision in the northern, central, and southern Appalachians, facilitating an integrated understanding of the entire orogen.  This project also will support the training and education of undergraduate students; strong research and education infrastructures through collaborations with other universities; and broad dissemination of results at conferences, in papers, and through the EarthChem Library database.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDetermining the reasons for the existence of mountains has been a subject for thinkers on the natural world for millennia.  Since the plate tectonics revolution, our understanding of regional convergent orogeny focuses either on collisions or subduction-related orogeny in the absence of collision.  The Appalachians are one of the type examples of an accretionary orogen, constructed in part by collisions between Laurentia and microcontinents and arcs in early to middle Paleozoic time.  As a type example for collisional orogeny, it is well established that collision of mostly peri-Gondwanan terranes caused early to middle Paleozoic orogenesis in the northern and southern Appalachians.  However, no similar terranes have been found between the New York City area and central Virginia, despite widespread and intense early Paleozoic deformation and metamorphism there.  This difference leads to unresolved first-order questions such as: What type of tectonics caused pervasive and intense early Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation in the central Appalachian Piedmont?  At a larger scale, how can we tie well-constrained accretionary orogeny in the northern and southern Appalachians through the intervening central Appalachians, and what do these correlations mean for the tectonic development of the Appalachians?  Answers to these questions are first-order inputs into understanding the classic Appalachian paradigm and also bear on accretionary orogenesis in general.\n\n \n\nTo address these questions, I collected samples of meta-sandstone from southeastern Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, Maryland, and northern Virginia.  With the aid of undergraduate geology majors, I isolated zircon from each sample and dated the cores of individual zircon grains using the uranium-lead isotopic system.  U/Pb ages from two samples confirm the presence of zircon derived from an exotic terrane, but I did not find zircon from an exotic terrane in the other samples.  One sample with exotic zircon is located west of Baltimore, the other in northern Virginia.  Thus it appears that an exotic terrane is present in the central Appalachians, similar to the geologic settings to the north and south.  Collision with this exotic terrane could have caused early to middle Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation of the central Appalachians.  In the Appalachian Mountains there is no evidence for major orogeny in the absence of collision.\n\n \n\nThis study provided research experience for two undergraduate geology majors, broadening and deepening their proficiency in geology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron J Martin"
