 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase I project advances antenna technology and wireless network performance by developing a basis for a new kind of wireless mesh network node, i.e. integrated router, radio and antenna. Networking has proven to be an important productivity resource, but can come at a high cost especially for high-\u00ad&#8208;data rates. Dramatic capacity gains in urban networks are achieved by deploying directional antennas at higher frequency to minimize interference and allow substantial frequency reuse. Indoor mounting of nodes in windows is desirable to avoid complications with landlords, avoid weather, and decrease RF path loss. Finally, larger antennas produce more directionality, so the desired wireless node needs a large surface area and yet must be something that people are willing to hang in their windows, i.e. transparent and attractive. This project will use transparent conductive coatings in combination with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radio technology to establish the feasibility of a mostly transparent wireless node that achieves a 6 degree wide beam that is electronically steerable over >120 degrees.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased US competitiveness by facilitating the spread of high speed Internet access and through the sale of innovative new devices in the US and worldwide. Community networks will deploy these nodes, as they are the lowest cost and simplest way to create an inter-\u00ad&#8208;building network. In particular, delivering signals via windows overcomes RF absorption in the masonry structures typical of public housing projects. Successful commercialization of this technology will significantly reduce the cost and increase the performance of urban wireless networks, thus helping extend Internet access to un-\u00ad&#8208; and under-\u00ad&#8208;served neighborhoods and reducing the cost of offloading 3G/4G wireless traffic to local Wi-\u00ad&#8208;Fi hotspots.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Transparent Wireless Mesh Network Node\n\nOur ultimate objective is a low cost wireless mesh device, installable by anyone, which automatically joins with other nodes to form an inter-building neighborhood mesh network with dramatically more speed and capacity than traditional wireless mesh networks.  Our devices will enable individuals, community groups and Internet Service Providers to bring high capacity Internet access to unserved and underserved neighborhoods. \n\nOur solution is a seemingly clear sheet of plastic that folks are willing to hang in their window, but which sends and receives highly directional radio beams, steered in software as shown in Figure 1.\n\nOf course there are a number of technical issues, not the least of which is making an efficient multi-element antenna out of transparent conductive materials.  In Phase I, we sought to establish the feasibility of our long term goal by identifying appropriate transparent conductive materials and using computer simulation software to evaluate alternate antenna designs.\n\nThe choice of transparent conductive material is key.  We evaluated a number of materials that are used in solar cells and touch screens, but none were suitable for a high efficiency antenna.  The answer we found was an open mesh of very fine copper traces in a pattern with relatively large openings.  For example, a copper mesh of 20 &micro;m lines (less than 1/1000th of an inch) and 200 &micro;m openings is invisible to the naked eye, but lets through 83% of the light. For an antenna, this copper mesh performs 20x to 100x better than the Indium Tin Oxide coating we were considering when we wrote our original Phase I grant proposal.\n\nEqually important, we've found a vendor that can manufacture the copper patterns we need on 5 mil plastic film using a roll-to-roll process at a cost of $8-$10 per sq. ft. on existing prototype machinery.  This puts initial production well within our budget and leaves plenty of room for later cost reductions.  We plan to glue the 5 mil film circuitry to a 12\" x 15\" sheet of 1/4\" clear acrylic for rigidity.  The clear acrylic is supported in turn by a thin opaque bar that contains the radio and control circuitry.  The result, illustrated in Figure 1, is what folks will hang in their windows.\n\nBased on the properties of the chosen materials, we used computer simulation software to evaluate alternate antenna designs and beam steering circuit designs. In the course of this effort we came up with a novel beam steering circuit design that leverages our transparent material, further reducing the size of the opaque bar at the top of our wireless mesh network node.\n\nAll of our Phase I work has been paper designs and computer simulations.  In the next phase we will fabricate samples with actual materials to verify and calibrate our simulations and then build several prototype systems to that can automatically establish a high capacity wireless mesh network.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brough Turner"
