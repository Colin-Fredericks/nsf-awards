 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to create a sustainable Network of engineering faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities to focus on the development, implementation, and expansion of an experiment-centric instructional pedagogy, based on the Mobile Studio. The project is implementing this pedagogy in 39 different courses across the 13 HBCUs participating in the network and studying the effect of the implementation on motivation and retention.\r\n\r\nThis project is expanding the use of the hands-on pedagogy across the electrical engineering curriculum at 13 HBCUs. The approach is designed to give the student the ability to apply what they have learned anytime anywhere as well as to tinker and ask \"what if\" questions. One of the goals of this program is to test whether this approach increases student interest in STEM and increases retention of students at minority-serving institutions.",
