 "awd_abstract_narration": "A competition experiment between wintering Redstarts and resident Yellow Warblers in Jamaican mangrove forest\r\n\r\nIn the Caribbean, the winter influx of billions of migratory songbirds coincides with low arthropod abundances, and food shortages can limit wintering songbird populations. Despite recent progress in understanding migratory bird ecology, the question remains: how do so many ecologically similar migrant and resident species coexist during the most resource-poor time of year?  All available evidence suggests that food-based competition allows coexistence of migrant and resident birds in Jamaican mangrove forests, yet no published study in any system has experimentally demonstrated that interspecific competition for food exists between migrant and resident birds. The primary objective of this study is to perform a reciprocal removal experiment to determine whether interspecific competition exists between resident Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) and wintering American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). This study will quantify and compare: 1) resource use (three-dimensional territory size, foraging behavior), 2) fitness indices (body mass change, spring departure date), and 3) density of Yellow Warblers and ecologically similar American Redstarts on control (unaltered) and experimental (one species removed) mangrove plots. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to determine if food-based competition drives coexistence between resident and migrant birds, providing much needed insight into the processes that maintain migratory bird populations throughout the annual cycle. The study will maximize interactions with Jamaican and Caribbean/Hispanic students by recruiting field technicians from underrepresented groups and hiring at least one Jamaican field assistant each year. In collaboration with the University of the West Indies, two five-day field courses will be run for undergraduate- and graduate-level Jamaicans.",

In the Caribbean, the winter influx of migrants coincides with low arthropod abundances, and food shortages can limit wintering songbird populations. Despite recent progress in understanding migratory bird ecology, the question remains: how do so many ecologically similar migrant and resident species coexist during the most resource-poor time of year? Interspecific competition has long thought to drive the structure of migrant-resident bird communities, but evidence is still equivocal and it remains an unresolved, yet central issue in migratory bird ecology. All the available evidence suggests that interspecific competition for food and space allows coexistence of migrant and resident birds in Jamaican mangrove forests, yet no published study in any system has experimentally demonstrated that interspecific competition exists between wintering migrant and resident birds. Insectivorous birds inhabiting Jamaican mangrove forest during the Boreal winter provide an ideal opportunity to investigate ecological interactions and consequences of coexistence of wintering migrant and tropical resident species.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The primary goal of this study was to determine whether interspecific competition exists between resident Yellow Warblers (<em>Dendroica petechia</em>) and wintering American Redstarts (<em>Setophaga ruticilla</em>), a critical step toward understanding the importance of resource-based competition as a mechanism influencing avian population processes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, we looked at redstarts returning to winter in our plots between years. Twenty redstarts with at least some overlap with mapped Yellow Warbler territories returned to the same mangrove plots between 2014 and 2015.&nbsp; 14 of the 20 birds decreased their 2D overlap with Yellow Warbler territories between years, which was highly significant overall (mean = -28.3%).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Second, we used 2D territory mapping techniques to quantify the 2D overlap of redstart and Yellow Warbler territories, and to see how this varied by age of the redstart. Younger (less experienced) redstarts had about twice as much overlap with Yellow Warblers as their older counterparts, further suggesting that given experience, redstarts will choose territories that avoid the dominant species.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Third, we performed removal experiments by 3D mapping territories of 35 redstarts with and without Yellow Warblers. Male redstarts&mdash;especially second-year birds&mdash;moved into Yellow Warbler core areas when Yellow Warblers were absent. Second-year female redstarts moved away from Yellow Warbler core areas during removals&mdash;probably because dominant second-year males were defending the newly available, resource-rich space against other redstarts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, we looked at indices of fitness for redstarts to see how this correlated with 2D overlap with Yellow Warbler territories.
