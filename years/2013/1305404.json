 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  RouteViews is a system for systematically collecting data on the routes (the paths by which data gets from point A to point B) used by Internet traffic.  It has played a critical role in the study of significant events, such as large scale outages, that have taken place in the Internet.  The RouteViews data archives are the most widely used source of Internet routing data for the computer networking, network operations and network security communities.    They are also increasingly being used in studies of network topological growth and network economics.  However, access to the RouteViews data has been challenging to new users since the data is current structured as flat binary files with no simple interfaces for searching or accessing the data.\r\n\r\nThis project will design and implement database access to the RouteViews data, and will develop simple interfaces and tools for accessing the data.  The resources used to acquire and store the data will also be expanded.  The project will open up the use of routing data to a broader community including undergraduate education.   It will work with the community to raise awareness about the potential uses of routing data in research and education, and will promote the use of the new access methods.\r\n\r\nThe project will expand routing data collection, will make it easier to access the collected data and will benefit  networking research, network operations and network security.",
