 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on previous successes by providing a mentoring program and faculty led extra-curricular activities. The current project is increasing retention of all students and most notably of the scholars.  Successful elements of the earlier project that are being continued include a three-week summer bridge session prior to the freshman year focusing on the transition to college, cohort building activities, and monitoring of academic progress with appropriate interventions. The project is providing a supportive environment that improves learning, encourages student bonding and good study skills, and reinforces student motivation to earn a degree in a STEM field. The project is awarding scholarships to 33 incoming high-need, high-ability freshmen in the departments of Engineering, Computer Science and Information Assurance. These scholarships are renewable for the sophomore year. After students reach the milestone third year, the college is providing continuing financial support for the remaining two years, along with advising, mentoring and career-planning assistance. Participants are selected based on financial need, SAT scores, high school grades, and an interview process. Cohorts of 11 students enter the college as freshmen in three fall semesters. An evaluation process is determining if retention is improved and if it is correlated to project activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCapitol Technology University implemented a need based scholarship program with the intent to:\n\nIntellectual Merit&mdash;remove the distractions of financial need and provide a supportive environment for student success. The project builds on previous S-STEM grant by adding a faculty mentoring component, and continues a three-week summer ?bridge? session prior to the freshman year.\n\nBroader Impacts&mdash;By reducing attrition, this project was expected to increase the number of STEM graduates entering the workforce. Including, many will be minorities and first-generation college students who might not otherwise complete college.\n\nKey components - The program included a selection process, a summer bridge program, shared first year classes, monthly workshops, and mentoring. \n\nSelection Process - Eligible applicants (those who meet the high-ability and high-need criteria) were invited to campus for a full-day program with speakers and campus tours, a luncheon, and an individual interview. During the interview, each applicant delivered a prepared presentation to the Selection Committee and participated in a structured interview. By participating in this event, applicants demonstrate their interest and motivation, which are two key factors in retention and graduation rates (Eris, 2010; Seymour, 1997).   The structured interview  and a scoring rubric helps to evaluate the non-cognitive factors in college success, such as; executive functioning, commitment to field of study, and commitment to meeting the more vigorous standards of college studies.  \n\nEach year 14 students were selected.  Three slots were need blind and were funded by the university.  The additional 11 slots were funded by the grant and required students to demonstrate unmet financial need and high-ability. \n\nSummer Bridge &ndash; During the 3 week Capitol Institute for Summer Success students lived in the residence halls and participated in 6 contact hours a day for 12 days.  Student placement into the course content was largely dependent on math placement results.  Students who did not place into the entry level math required for their degree program participated in a math workshop. Students who did place into the entry level math required for their degree participated in a workshop with a technical focus.  In addition, all students participated in a workshop which incorporated the engineering process and a group project.  The students participated in educational field trips once a week and group activities funded by the university over the weekends. \n\nShared Classes &ndash; During the first semester all members of the cohort participated in a first-year seminar focused on college success strategies.  One of the PI?s served as the instructor for the seminar.\n\nMonthly Workshops &ndash; Several times each semester all the enrolled students would gather together to participate in a faculty led discussion or a student lead activity.  These activities encouraged students to remain connected over their career at Capitol Technology University and to continue to engage informally with faculty.\n\nFaculty Mentoring &ndash; This was the most challenging of support services.  It was difficult to identify times when faculty and students were available to meet.  The PI developed materials to support the mentors and worked with the administrative team to address logistical issues.  The active and consistent participation of a faculty lead to support this effort is required for success. \n\nPersistence Outcomes - The reported results represent only the 33 students whose scholarships were funded by the NSF S-STEM grant.   The stated persistence goal was to retain students at a rate of 80% into their junior year.  81% of Cohort 1 persisted into their junior or third year while the entire 2014 cohort persistence rate of 67%.  100% of cohort 2 persisted into their junior or third year while the entire 2015 cohort persistence rate of 65%. Following the end of their senior or fourth year, the cohort?s combined graduation/persistence rate is 72% compared to that of the entire 2014 cohort rate of 60%.  All 11 students of Cohort 2 have achieved senior status (greater than 90 credits) and are expected to complete their degrees in 2019.  Cohort 3 has a total of 12 students from the 2016 cohort who have participated in the program and 10 remain enrolled.  83% of cohort 2 persisted into their junior or third year while the entire 2015 cohort persistence rate of 65%.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melinda Bunnell-Rhyne"
