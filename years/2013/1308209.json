 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"3-Manifolds: Heegaard Splittings, the Curve Complex, and Hyperbolic Geometry\" is a mathematics research conference which will be held April 19-21, 2013 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. This conference will bring together senior and junior researchers in the above areas of 3-manifolds in order to share recent progress and reflect on the future direction of the subject. It will feature approximately eight research lectures together with an introductory lecture intended for graduate students.  Ample time will be set aside for interaction and collaboration among the attendees.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its broadest terms this project is about the mathematical structure of the \"shape\" of 3-dimensional objects (topology/geometry). Understanding complex shapes has many diverse applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is crucial to drug development. The geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data has important military and commercial applications. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is vital in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes. In the past few decades, topology has experienced fundamental and transformative developments. This conference will fertilize new research directions by encouraging mathematical interaction and collaboration among researchers. The budget will help support the travel expenses of the speakers, and it will provide partial support to graduate students and other young researchers to  enable their participation in this event. Every effort will be made to support and encourage participation from underrepresented groups. Registration for the conference is available at the conference website, http://math.rice.edu/Conferences/3-Manifolds/",
