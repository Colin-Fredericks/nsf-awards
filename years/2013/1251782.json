 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year synthesis project, led by researchers at Utah State University, focuses on the use of scaffolding in STEM learning in formal and informal settings. Scaffolding is support that helps students engage in and gain skill at tasks that are beyond their unassisted capabilities. The project uses meta-analysis to determine the influence of scaffold characteristics, study and assessment instrument quality, and assessment type on cognitive outcomes in K-Adult STEM education. \r\n\r\nPreparing all students to address fundamental STEM problems is central to preparing effective citizens for the 21st century. Combined with scaffolding, inquiry-based approaches in STEM education can lead to this goal. A current lack of a comprehensive assessment of scaffolding characteristics hinders (a) scaffolding adoption by STEM instructors and administrators and (b) scaffolding design by instructional designers.",

The project was designed to synthesize published research on cognitive outcomes resulting from the use of computer-based scaffolding within problem-centered instruction in STEM education (K-12, college, graduate/professional, and adult). Three different types of meta-analyses were completed &ndash; traditional, between-subjects meta-analysis; Bayesian network (within-subjects) meta-analysis; and Bayesian between-subjects meta-analysis. The first traditional meta-analysis synthesized 144 studies (Belland, Walker, Kim, &amp; Lefler, 2017). The overall effect size of scaffolding was <em>g</em> = 0.46, and scaffolding had strong effects across participant populations (elementary to adult) and there was no difference in effect size based on scaffold customization or scaffold customization basis. The second traditional meta-analysis found that when scaffolding was used by pairs or larger groups, effect sizes were larger when the scaffolding did not contain support for collaboration. The first Bayesian network meta-analysis examined contexts of scaffolding use using coding of 49 studies and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations; pre-post gains were strongest for students with learning disabilities (<em>g</em> = 3.13) and English Language Learners (<em>g</em> = 0.92) (Belland, Walker, &amp; Kim, 2017). The second Bayesian network meta-analysis examined scaffolding characteristics using coding of 47 studies and MCMC simulations; scaffolding that did not customize over time led to stronger pre-post gains than scaffolding that faded, added, or both faded and added (Walker et al., 2016).
