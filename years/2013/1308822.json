 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds William Lennon of the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan.  The project title is \"Computational Modeling of the Cerebellum with Additional Biological Realism.\" The host scientists are Professors Nobito Yamamoto and Tadashi Yamazaki.\r\n\r\nWhile much is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum, the function of this brain structure remains vague.  Roughly speaking, the cerebellum is responsible for ensuring the precise timing and coordination of movement, and is hypothesized to have similar effects on cognition.  Computational modeling of the cerebellum has been underway for many decades and has aided researchers in testing hypotheses about its function that would otherwise be impossible in a laboratory setting.  Recently, neuroscientists have realized the importance of a particular cell type in the cerebellum, the molecular layer interneuron (MLI).  Historically, these cell types have received relatively little attention from neuroscientists and as a result are poorly understood.  This project investigates the role of MLIs in a computational model of the cerebellum.  In particular, this project investigates the role of learning at synapses formed by MLIs and their effect on learning and control of movement.  A better understanding of brain structures like the cerebellum will ultimately guide our understanding of neurological disorders like schizophrenia and autism that are believed to affect these structures.  Additional insight into the function of the cerebellum may also lead to novel algorithms in robotics and the control of prosthetic devices.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the PI plans to disseminate the results of this study by publication in peer-reviewed journals, publication of the source code in publicly available databases, and as course material for teaching future students of computational neuroscience.",
