 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes major steps towards concretely defining core concepts and competencies outlined in the NSF-AAAS report, Vision and Change, and provides tools to allow programmatic assessment in undergraduate biology education. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development, validation, and field-testing of tools called Bio-MAPS (Biology-Measuring Achievement and Progression in Science). Specifically, four Bio-MAPS assessments are being produced: molecular and cellular biology, physiology and neuroscience, ecology and evolution, and an overall comprehensive measure. The research team is working with biology faculty at diverse institutions that span the breadth of higher education to develop a framework that outlines expectations for what students should know and be able to do at different collegiate levels. \r\n\r\nData from Bio-MAPS are expected to provide dramatic broader impacts and catalyze curricular reform by: 1) diagnosing areas in which students struggle despite instruction, 2) allowing two-year community colleges to evaluate how well they are preparing students for transfer to four-year institutions, 3) inspiring and directing faculty and institutional conversations about enacting change at the programmatic level, 4) helping administrators focus limited resources on aspects of the curricula needing revision, and 5) challenging faculty to re-design courses to scaffold student learning. Biology departments can also use Bio-MAPS assessments to demonstrate evidence of student learning for accreditation processes. \r\n\r\nMany agencies now require evidence of student learning and data on how well programs meet the needs of diverse student populations. This focus on tangible learning outcomes requires that institutions have a means of quantitatively measuring student progression through a curriculum. Bio-MAPS can provide a means of measuring student progress through a curriculum. Other science disciplines may be interested in developing similar assessments for their students. \r\n\r\nThis project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n          With rising tuition costs and increased options for on-line courses, there has been a shift over the past ten years in higher education toward greater accountability for student outcomes and a recognition that students and parents alike want to know the \"value-added\" of a college education.   Administrators and department chairs in life-science departments have been looking for tools they can use to measure student gains.  In addition, educators also need assessment tools that can measure, observe, or make inferences about student learning in order to guide evidence-based instructional decisions. Many such tools already exist that are designed to collect evidence on student thinking at the beginning and end of a topic or single course, but few exist that can measure student progress over the course of a major or program.  With this grant, we first established a framework (BioCore Guide), and then developed a suite of programmatic assessment instruments referred to as Bio-MAPS (Measuring Achievement and Progression in Science), that includes the Molecular Biology Capstone Assessment, the Phys-MAPS, the EcoEvo-MAPS, and the GenBio-MAPS.

Each assessment follows the same general format: question stems that present a biological scenario, followed by multiple statements, to which students answer either T/F or likely/unlikely.\n\n            The intellectual merit of this project is in the Bio-MAPS products themselves, in what they have revealed about student thinking, and in their potential to help programs determine how to improve their curricula.  For each instrument, common student incorrect ideas were identified that persist across different levels of students, and other ideas were identified for which students at higher levels have mastered.  Administrators of these instruments can follow cohorts of students as they progress through a major, identifying these persistently incorrect ideas, and making changes to how these concepts are taught in order to better prepare future students.       \n\n            We have received substantial interest from the academic community in the Bio-MAPS assessments and anticipate that these tools will be used widely by both 2-year and 4-year institutions to routinely gather information on student progress.  In addition to the 50 institutions that participated in piloting the Bio-MAPS instruments, the project?s broader impacts will be realized as these and other departments and programs begin to use these tools as described above.  Each of the instruments will be available for online administration, along with scoring sheets and guidelines for interpreting outcomes. Bio-MAPS can provide the tools necessary to encourage instructors and administrators at different institutions to share common student struggles, ultimately helping programs across the country better serve their student populations. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer K Knight"
