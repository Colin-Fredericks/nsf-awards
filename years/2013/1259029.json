 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Javelina Engineers STEM Scholarship (JESS) program provides scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students to complete baccalaureate and master's degrees in engineering, computer science, or industrial management and technology at Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK), a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The JESS program objectives are to: recruit at least 20 academically promising students with diverse socio-economic backgrounds and high levels of financial need, with an emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented groups; retain 80% of these students through completion of a baccalaureate degree and 40% through enrollment into a master's program; and integrate student support infrastructure across the TAMUK campus to improve access to services for all engineering students. Additionally, JESS partners with Del Mar College, an HSI community college in the same service region, to recruit and retain high-quality community college transfer students to TAMUK College of Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe JESS program provides comprehensive support for both bachelor's and master's degrees. Student support services include tutoring, social activities, one-on-one advising from JESS project team members, undergraduate research and/or internship placement, and a lecture series to promote graduate school preparation and awareness. Scholarships are awarded to Javelina Scholars early in their undergraduate careers with the expectation that they pursue a master's program immediately following attainment of the baccalaureate degree. At least 20 scholarships are provided annually for students studying architectural, chemical, civil, electrical, environmental, or mechanical engineering; industrial management and technology; or computer science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Javelina Engineering STEM Scholarships (or JESS) program was intended to provide scholarships for students pursuing B.S. degrees from the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, a Hispanic Serving Institution in South Texas.  Additionally, the JESS program provided mentoring opportunities to encourage JESS scholarship recipients to pursue graduate school in a STEM field.\n\nOver the life of the project, the JESS program provided scholarships to 39 participants.  Of these participants, 36 (92.3%) completed B.S. degrees in STEM fields.  16 participants (41.0%) enrolled in programs leading to M.S. degrees in STEM fields, and 2 of these students are on tracks leading to the Ph.D.  Currently, 27 (69.2%) of JESS participants are working in a STEM field, several of whom are concurrently working on M.S. degrees.  3 (7.7%) additional participants are full-time graduate students.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nSurvey data collected from participants over 5 years was used to measure the effectiveness of the JESS program.  In all 5 years, over 90% of participants indicated that the scholarships received as part of the JESS program were critical to their ability to pursue their chosen degree.  This data reinforces the importance of financial opportunities for students with high levels of financial need.  Many JESS participants had no expected family contribution on their FAFSA documents, so the scholarship was truly critical to their ability to stay in school.\n\nAnother item of interest was whether mentoring and professional development opportunities could increase student interest in and understanding of graduate school opportunities.  In the first year of the program, only 67% of survey participants indicated that the JESS program had improved their understanding of or interest in graduate school.  By the fifth year, this percentage had risen to 100%.  Two factors are likely to have accounted for this increase: (1) development of a multi-disciplinary engineering capstone course; and (2) hiring a graduate student mentor to organize participant activities.  The multi-disciplinary engineering capstone course provided a mechanism for participants to form a more cohesive cohort while also allowing for more seminars and workshops to be delivered to the students.  The graduate student mentor was instrumental in arranging additional activities, the most successful of which was an annual graduate student discussion panel.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis JESS program had a signficant impact on the lives of the participants by enabling the students to pursue one or more STEM degrees.  The participants themselves represent a diverse body of students.  27 participants (69.2%) were Hispanic, and 15 (38.5%) were female.  These students are already having an impact on their fields and on their communities.  \n\nThe JESS program also improved the infrastructure for education within the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering through creation of a new engineering capstone course experience and support of an innovative student center available to all engineering students.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Breanna M Bailey"
