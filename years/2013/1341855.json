MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.",
