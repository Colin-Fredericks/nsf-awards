This workshop is part of a series of geoscience domain end-user workshops to solicit the needs and requirements from end-user groups of EarthCube so that those needs and requirements can be addressed in the EarthCube design and implementation.\r\n\r\nEarthCube is a community-driven activity sponsored through a partnership between the NSF Directorate of Geosciences and Office of Cyberinfrastructure to transform the conduct of geosciences research and education.  EarthCube aims to create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner, thus accelerating the ability of the geosciences community to understand and predict the Earth system.",
