 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Aubree Webb of The Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project in the Education and Human Resource area during the summer of 2013 at the Computer Network Information Center (CNIC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China.  The project title is \"Virtual Inquiry Projects in Science Classrooms: Do Grizzly Bears and 3-D Avatars Impact Students' Inquiry Skills?.\" The host scientist is Xiao Yun, Professor and Director of the Internet-based Science Communication Center at the Computer Network Information Center in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nIncorporating technology into the classroom is an important goal of science educators.  While there are increasing numbers of studies in this area, there are not many with cross-cultural measures.  Studying the cross-cultural outcomes of authentic web-based inquiry has the potential to contribute much to the field of science education.  The purpose of this project is to advance the collaboration between the Computer Network Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Texas A&M University, and the Pennsylvania State University.  This project introduces a project called Bear Cam and adapts the ongoing Virtual Ecological Inquiry project for a cross-cultural study.  Bear Cam is a web-based inquiry database with images of bears.  Virtual Ecological Inquiry is an immersive inquiry where students operate an avatar around the virtual Wolong Nature Reserve.  In each project, students complete an inquiry project and produce a final report meeting current science standards in obtaining, evaluating, and communicating data.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this study can inform software developers and teachers about the best way to reach students in highly diverse settings.  Virtual and web-based inquiry also has the added benefit of increasing student interaction with other students from geographically diverse locations, an important experience in an increasingly global world. If the web-based inquiry projects increase student interest and learning outcomes in ecology across various learning settings and with diverse student populations, the next step is for the researcher to scale up and develop the technology for easy access into ecology classrooms and informal science education settings in the United States and across the world.  One goal of the entire collaboration is to motivate more students from a range of backgrounds, especially those underrepresented in science, to pursue a career in one of the STEM fields.  The Fellow will share results with those interested in science and technology by presenting at international and international conferences and university-level research seminars and publishing in related journals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this research is to analyze a web-based authentic inquiry learning approach to assess its impact on student learning and attitudes towards science within a 5th grade classroom in the suburbs of Beijing, China.  The program, BearCam, is an authentic web-based inquiry project that allows students to explore the lives of grizzly bears in McNeil River, Alaska.  Students\u00c6 attitudes towards science and learning outcomes were measured and analyzed using the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) and a post-project survey. \n\nStudents scored similarly on both subscales related to attitude and science, and these two subscales were significantly correlated (r = 0.719, p-value &lt;0.001).  The Career Interest in Science subscale showed significantly lower scores than the Adoption of Scientific Attitudes (t33 = 2.321, p-value = 0.027).  These results point to future research on low-income Chinese elementary students\u00c6 interest in pursuing a STEM career, though the reliabilities found in this sample suggest further reliaility study of the TOSRA with this demographic and in this geographical region.  \n\nStudents reported that they learned more doing the BearCam inquiry project when compared to reading, lecture, and going on a fieldtrip.  Students had a high interest in ecology both before and after the inquiry project.  Their self-reported ability to make a hypothesis significantly increased after participating in the project (t32 = -3.177, p-value = 0.003) as well as their understanding of how ecologists conduct research (t32 = -2.274, p-value = 0.030).  Students rated their learning at 6.97 on a scale of 1-10, their interest at 8.12, and the BearCam project an overall 8.68.  Only three students indicated that they would not like to do the BearCam project again.\n\nOverall, results show that BearCam is a successful inquiry project for this demographic.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aubree M Webb"
