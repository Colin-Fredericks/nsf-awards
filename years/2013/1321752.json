This travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high-level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers exchange innovative ideas and other information, and they will hear first-hand presentations of up-to-date research results in nanoscale science and technology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to others is an important element of a graduate student?s education. Also important is leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested support will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special student breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the students optimal techniques for presenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together. The provision of support will greatly ease the burden on students in finding funds needed to attend a conference, especially early in their academic careers, when this lesson can be most formative.",
