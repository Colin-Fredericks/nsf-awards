The symposium will include eight half-day oral sessions and one poster session and will provide a forum for fostering scientific exchanges on the latest developments on the design of soft materials resulting from the integration of simulation, theory and experimental approaches.  The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and federal laboratories who are harnessing the interplay between simulation, theory, and experiments to explore and validate the design of synthetic and organic soft materials.  The program will enable the dissemination of state-of-the-art developments in the field and serve to educate the next generation of young researchers while broadening the participation of underrepresented categories in materials research.  The MRS meetings provide a broad forum for dissemination of scientific results and exchanges between material scientists from different disciplines working on diverse topics.  A distinguished group of invited speakers has been confirmed.   \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Part:  The symposium is well aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative and will stimulate the use of computational and theoretical methods in the design of new soft materials.  The organizers of this symposium are strongly committed to involving the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.  The organizers will encourage the participation by prioritizing the travel and registration support for such groups of researchers.  Similarly, attention will be given to participation of researchers and students from undergraduate institutions.  The symposium organizers and the invited speakers include both women and members of ethnic minorities; there are two women among the co-organizers and four women among the invited speakers with two speakers from underrepresented minorities.",
