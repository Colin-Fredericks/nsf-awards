 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: Semiconductor nanowires allow the interrogation of unique materials physics that arises in one-dimensional materials and the exploitation of their properties for a wide range of applications. PbSe is a unique materials system to probe in one-dimension: it has large electron, hole, and exciton Bohr radii, giving rise to strong quantum confinement in small-diameter nanowires, and it has a large dielectric constant compared to host matrices, leading to strong dielectric confinement. Confinement effects in nanowires dramatically alter their electronic structure as well as carrier statistics, dynamics, and transport. The goal of this project is to understand the influences of strong quantum and dielectric confinement on the electronic properties of PbSe nanowires and their importance in designing nanowire p-n junctions in particular for mid-infrared photodetectors and for photovoltaics. Colloidal PbSe nanowires, tunable from 4 to 20 nm in diameter, are synthesized and integrated as single nanowires and nanowire arrays in devices embedded in different dielectric environments. After nanowire integration, routes to substitutionally and remotely dope nanowires are applied to understand doping and its efficiency in these one-dimensional, strongly quantum and dielectrically confined semiconductors and to controllably define p-n junctions within high-mobility nanowires. Electrical and optoelectronic measurements are used to probe doping efficiency and charge injection and transport in n- and p-doped PbSe building blocks and the electrostatics, carrier diffusion, and performance of p-n junctions to design high-efficiency optoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: Semiconductor devices are constructed by defining junctions between n- and p-type doped regions, to introduce excess electrons and holes, respectively. In one-dimensional materials, the p-n junctions are affected by their small diameter as well as by contrast between the dielectric constant of the nanowires and their surrounding materials. This project explores the impact of one dimension in a semiconductor material where the effects of small size and dielectric contrast are high. These nanowires are promising for high-efficiency mid-infrared photodetectors and for photovoltaics. This project provides an interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI and students are sharing the science of one-dimensional, nanoscale materials and their technologies through student coursework and outreach activities to engage K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.",

The design and operation of such devices requires control over the concentration of electrons and holes to create, respectively, the n-type and p-type, building blocks of devices. We synthesized lead selenide NWs by wet-chemical methods and assembled the NWs to from NW array or single NW devices [Figure 1]. We showed that we can &ldquo;remotely&rdquo; dope lead selenide NWs by adding atoms or ions to their surface through physical and solution-based methods. By adding lead or selenium, we altered the stoichiometry to make the NWs n-type or p-type, or by introducing indium or oxygen impurities, known to serve as electron donors and acceptors in the bulk, we also created n-type and p-type NWs. The n-type or p-type behavior is seen in their electrical characteristics [Figure 2].</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">By selectively doping one side of the NWs p-type and the other side n-type we formed pn junctions. We used the p- and n-type regions along the wires to create p- and n-type field-effect transistors and employed these devices to build complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, in particular inverters that show high gains of 15 for signal amplification and a near full signal swing for switching [Figure 3]. We also used the pn junctions in the NW arrays to realize photodiodes that switch more than 1000 times faster than that of their photoconductors [Figure 4]. We further showed that our selective doping processes for the lead selenide NW arrays are also compatible with device fabrication on flexible plastics.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While we successfully n-doped and p-doped the NWs, the efficiency of doping, i.e., the concentration of electrons or holes created by each added dopant, was low at ~1%, a problem that is generally observed in low-dimensional semiconductors. Low doping efficiency required a large number of dopants to be introduced to realize high conductances, but it is anticipated to undesirably scatter carriers and lower their mobility and therefore degrade device performance. We showed that the low doping efficiency in the NWs arises from dielectric confinement effects, which are established by the mismatch between the high dielectric constant of the NWs and the low dielectric constant of the surrounding [Figure 5]. By encapsulating the NWs in high dielectric constant polymers and oxide materials, we enhanced the doping efficiency by &gt;10 fold. We developed a theoretical model and showed that the increased dielectric constant of the environment better screens the Coulomb interaction between carriers and dopants and lowers the ionization energy of free carriers. We showed that engineering the dielectric environment of the NWs provided a simple approach to enhance doping efficiency, which is broadly applicable to the design of nanostructures and important to their device applications.</p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" class=\"mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: \">Colloidal lead selenide nanowires (NWs) are promising materials for the solution-based assembly of high&nbsp;</span></div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cherie&nbsp;Kagan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309053/1309053_10264930_1509620437311_SEMimages--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309053/1309053_10264930_1509620437311_SEMimages--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scanning Electron Microscopy Images of Nanowire Devices\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1309053/1309053_10264930_1509620437311_SEMimages--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scanning Electron Microscopy Images of Nanowire Devices\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
