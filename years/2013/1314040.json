This award has support from: the Directorate for Geological Sciences and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to develop a better knowledge base to inform projections of the spatial distribution of population, providing additional tools for urban planners, economists, and governments to estimate the vulnerabilities to climate-related hazards.\r\n\r\nDr. Jones will be working with collaborators Prof. Deborah Balk of the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research and Dr. Brian O'Neill of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  Dr. Jones will also work with Prof. Mark Montgomery of the Department of Economics at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work has been primarily concerned with researching and developing theory regarding the drivers of change in the spatial distribution of human populations at multiple scales (e.g., state, county, city), and using that information to build a theoretically informed model for projecting alternative spatial population scenarios (assuming different socio-economic and demographic conditions).  The information generated is valuable to multiple user groups including the global change and climate-change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV) communities, as well as demographers, urban planners, and those tasked with ensuring resources are in place to serve future populations.  In this project we demonstrated applications of future projections through an analysis of projected exposure to certain climate-related hazards under alternative population and climate scenarios. The project was organized into three phases designed to address the following goals:\n\n1) Identify the drivers of spatial population change and isolate how they operate/vary at different scales.\n 2) Construct a theoretically consistent modeling framework for explaining and projecting alternative spatial population patterns that account for multi-level processes.\n 3) Investigate the sensitivity of projected exposure/vulnerability to climate-related hazards under alternative spatial population scenarios for selected regions of the world.\n\nGoal One\n\nWe hypothesized that a distinct hierarchy exists in the processes driving spatial patterns of population change and that, embedded within these processes, are indicators that will advance our understanding of how humans choose to orient themselves across the landscape. Our research confirmed this hypothesis, the drivers of spatial population do vary as a function of country and world region (because countries of varying wealth and economic structure exhibit different patterns of population change), the scale of analysis, and resolution (the size of the units of analysis).   As such, a complex diversity exists in the relationship between spatial population change and different drivers across different regions of the world.  In the United States we find, for example, a strong relationship between growth and natural amenities (i.e., the presence of  mountains, lakes, or beaches) at large scales (i.e., states), but only weak correlation with differences in average income at the same scale.  However, over smaller areas such as counties and cities variation at the income levels becomes more important.  Finally, over very small areas (e.g. neighborhoods) and geographic factors such as topography, proximity to water and roads, and population agglomeration (the presence of other people) become the most important factors. \n\nGoal Two\n\nAs the drivers of spatial population change have been found to vary as a function of scale (certain drivers operate over longer distances while others are very local), a model that allows for processes to operate at multiple-levels was necessary to accomplish goal two.  Through this project we developed a new model capable of application at different spatial scale and resolution.  The model is able to capture (through testing on historic data) and project spatially explicit population scenarios that incorporate processes that we have found occur over large areas in addition to local processes that differentiate outcomes over short distances. This award has proven vital to supporting the process of investigating, and incorporating these effects into an improved modeling framework.  Application of the model has resulted in a set of five spatial population projections, each of which incorporates different assumptions regarding future fertility/mortality rates, wealth, and connectivity with the rest of the world for each country.  These data are publicly available and are already widely used in the scientific community (see attached images).\n\nGoal Three\n\nWe conducted multiple studies that assessed the impact of spatial population and climate change on human exposure to climate-hazards, paying particular attention to extreme heat. From historic data we found that, for example, in the United States the rate at which deaths occurring due to natural heat exposure is strongest in areas that don't routinely experience extreme heat events. This suggests that conditioning is an important factor in risk assessment, and is crucial in targeting the likely location of future risk.  Cities such as Houston and Atlanta rightly receive significant attention in regards to future health risks associated with heat extremes. Our results suggest similar attention should be given to less obvious locations such as rust-belt cities, Appalachia, and urban areas of the Northern Plains.  Furthermore, large urban areas of the Northern US, such as New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, are particularly at risk for future heat-related public health crises.\n\nWe have consistently found that population redistribution is likely to contribute substantially to future exposure to heat extremes.  Results suggest that, over broad regions of the country, a third to half of projected increases in exposure will result from population change alone (the remainder is driven by climate change).  Put simply, people in the United States tend to move into harms way.  We believe it is crucial that planners, researchers, and civic institutions account for spatial population dynamics in public health, risk assessment, and planning applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bryan Jones"
