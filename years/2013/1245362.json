 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project transforms learning in introductory biology courses through a\r\ntechnology-supported, active-learning pedagogy that is informed by theory and\r\nevidence about learning systems. Specifically, this project overcomes students'\r\nproblems in understanding complex biological systems and distributes learning in a way\r\nthat actively engages students in and out of class. This project evaluates the\r\neffectiveness of the pedagogy, provides research on how introductory biology students\r\narticulate complex processes within and across biological systems, and investigates\r\ndevelopment of reflective and deep learning approaches.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project results from a technology-rich approach, allowing\r\ninstructors to communicate selected content outside of class and replacing traditional\r\nlectures with promising active learning strategies in class. An approach adapted from\r\nengineering that analyzes systems in terms of their Structure, Behavior, and Function is\r\nthe theoretical framework employed to facilitate learning and understanding of biological\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThis project creates broader impacts by building and strengthening community within\r\nand across institutions. At the collaborating institutions alone, several hundred students\r\nare expected to benefit from the enhanced instructional framework. Dissemination of\r\npractices and curricular materials should impact students at multiple institutions and\r\nlevels in the biology curriculum. Research findings are expected to be disseminated as\r\noral and poster communication at local and national meetings of professional societies.\r\nFurther, outcomes of this research are also expected to be disseminated via\r\nmanuscripts targeted for science education journals. Contributions to the STEM\r\neducation research literature should yield insights to the broader academic and science\r\neducation research communities.",
