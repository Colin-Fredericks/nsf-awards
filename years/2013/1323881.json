Different religious minority groups may have broadly similar patterns of migration to the two countries and have close ties with their compatriots across the border, but yet manifest divergent social profiles within and between Canada and the United States. Dominant paradigms of social incorporation emphasize the opportunity structure of the host country or the characteristics of groups in explaining differences in involvement. However, neither paradigm can satisfactorily explain both inter-country differences between the mobilization of varying religious groups in Canada and the United States and the intra-country differences between the public visibility and activism of the two groups. This research also aims to uncover the factors that influence the form that mobilization takes, whether it is \"ethnic,\" \"racial,\" or \"religious.\" It will examine how different opportunity structures (both national and local) and differences in the characteristics of the groups shape how they frame their grievances and mobilize. This project will be conducted in Toronto, Vancouver, New York/New Jersey, and Northern California, and will include interviews, analyses of information about the organizations, and media coverage of the groups. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project will reveal the factors shaping the very different patterns of activism and integration of immigrant groups from religious minority backgrounds. These groups in the United States and Canada comprise a large and politically active population that is non-white and largely non-Christian. An understanding of the political mobilization patterns of these individuals will help policy makers and members of the wider society to develop an appreciation for the concerns of many of the new ethnic groups that are becoming established in North America. It is also important for members of new ethno-religious groups to understand what types of organizations and activities are effective in helping them achieve a stake in their countries and shape policies.",
