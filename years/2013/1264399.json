 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaborative research project is to address the grand challenge caused by the skin and proximity effects in high-frequency applications. The objective of this project is to develop copper wires coated with copper-decorated carbon nanotubes to achieve reduced energy loss and overheating in electrical and electronic devices. The research approaches include realization of copper-decorated carbon nanotubes on textured copper wires to reduce the inter-tube impedance of carbon-nanotube films, uniformly aligning carbon nanotubes on copper wires using a simple mechanical wiping method, understanding the mechanism of reduced skin and proximity effects in carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires, and reducing the energy loss and overheating using the carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to significant outcomes, including controllable, aligned coating of carbon nanotubes on copper wires, fabricating robust CNT films through mechanical wiping, and carbon-nanotube-coated copper wires of high electrical and thermal conductivities for high-frequency applications. This research will impact all societal levels by revolutionizing the performance of copper wires in a wide range of applications. Practically, the proposed method is expected to provide a novel approach to reduce energy loss and heat generation in high-frequency applications. The research results will also contribute to productivity improvement, energy savings, and environmental protection in related industries that rely on high-frequency electrical signals and powers. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through involvement in the research and classroom instruction. The engagement of K-12 students and teachers in this project will also establish new partnerships between the universities and K-12 schools.",
