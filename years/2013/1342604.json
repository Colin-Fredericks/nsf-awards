 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive radiation occurs when one species of organism diversifies into several species that occupy distinct ecological niches.  The process is a common generator of biodiversity, yet the genetic changes underlying it have not been documented.  Parasites, one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth, are thought to adaptively radiate as they switch to new species of hosts.  This process will be studied using birds and feather lice, which are host specific parasites that spend all of their time on the host's body.  Lice will be transferred in controlled experiments between normal and novel species of captive hosts.  Evolutionary changes in genomes of the lice will be documented as they undergo adaptive radiation.\r\n  \r\nThe results of this work may have implications for basic research, as well as human and animal health.  Genomic data will be deposited in public databases.  One postdoctoral associate, two Ph.D. students, and several undergraduate students will be trained.  Two educational modules demonstrating adaptation by natural selection will be developed for K-12 students: \"cryptic critters\" (K-6) and \"hunker down\" (7-12).  These modules are cost effective and easy to implement.  Their effectiveness will be assessed with assistance from the University of Utah Center for Science and Math Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMore than half of all species on earth are parasites.  Therefore, studies of parasite diversification provide insights into the biodiversity of life on earth.  One major group of parasites that is found on nearly all groups of birds is feather lice.  These parasites eat the downy portions of the feathers of their hosts.  This project integrated transfer experiments, genome sequencing, and building trees of relatedness for the lice of pigeons and doves.  The experiments moved lice from normal pigeons to different pigeon breeds that differed in either feather color or body size.  Lice transferred to white pigeons became lighter, and lice transferred to large pigeons became larger. The genomes from these transferred lice were sequenced to identify which genes might be responsible for the adaptive changes that occurred several years after the transfer.  To understand how these changes relate to the diversity of pigeons and their feather lice, genome sequences from both the bird and their parasites were used to build trees of relatedness.\n\nComparisons of the tree for the parasitic lice to that of pigeons revealed several cases in which diversification in the lice matched that of the pigeons.  That is, lice that are closely related often occur on pigeon species that are closely related.  However, these comparisons also revealed that host switching was also an important process in parasite diversification, in which lice sometimes colonize distantly related host species.  In addition, the color and size of different species of lice was revealed to be more influenced by the color and size of their hosts, rather than by how the lice are related.  Diversification of pigeons was found to be strongly influenced by the geographic region in which they occur.  For example, all the pigeons from North and South America were closely related.  Similarly, most of the pigeons in Australia are closely related.\n\nThis project also had broader impacts beyond the intellectual merits of the study.  New techniques for using genome sequences to understand how species of parasites are related were developed for this study. The genome sequences generate for this project have been made publicly available to be used by other researchers for a variety of projects.  For example, some of the genome sequences that we produced have already been used to study the bacteria inside of the lice as well as the structure of the mitochondrial genome of lice.  This project provided training opportunities for three graduate students and a post-doctoral research associate, who were directly involved in the project.  A workshop was also designed, which provided training in the methods used for analysis of genomic data, and this workshop also provided training to students beyond those directly involved in the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin P Johnson"
