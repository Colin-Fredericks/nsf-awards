 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed meeting will take place over three days, August 1-3, 2013, at the Centre de recherches mathematiques in Montreal.\r\nThis proposal describes plans for the 15th New Researchers Conference, a conference series organized \r\nby and held for junior researchers under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS). \r\nThe primary objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers in \r\nstatistics and probability. The proposed meeting will take place over three days, August 1-3, 2013, at the \r\nCentre de recherches mathematiques in Montreal. The meeting will be held immediately preceding the \r\nJoint Statistical Meetings (JSM). Participants will be statisticians and probabilists who have received their \r\nPh.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive their degree within the same year. Each \r\nparticipant will present a short expository talk and a poster. Topics will cover a variety of areas in \r\nstatistics and probability, from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will give plenary \r\ntalks for inspiration and take part in four discussion panels covering topics of importance for young \r\npeople embarking on an academic/research career: teaching, mentoring, publishing and funding. \r\n \r\nThis conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and workers in statistics and \r\nprobability. In helping to create networks of new researchers, it lays the groundwork for future \r\ncollaboration and informal exchange of ideas and knowledge. It is also critical for building professional \r\ncohesion within the fields of statistics and probability and setting new frontiers for research. Meeting \r\npeople outside of one's research specialty area, and learning about their research, favors a more \r\ncomprehensive view of research, which is important when taking editor positions and other professional \r\nservice activities. The conference attracts participants with different backgrounds and nationalities, and \r\nunderrepresented groups (women, minorities and people with disabilities) are explicitly encouraged to \r\nattend. The conference website is available at http://www.math.mcgill.ca/nrc2013.",
