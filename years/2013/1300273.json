 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the integration of advanced numerical tools with laser nano-manufacturing techniques. The numerical tools, called transformation optics, will be used to calculate three-dimensional structures with pre-determined optical functions. The designed structures will be fabricated by multiple laser beam-enabled patterning techniques. The three-dimensional laser patterns will be controlled by a mini liquid crystal display (LCD) with very high numbers of pixels. The numerical information will be displayed to encode the laser beam pixel by pixel. This will enable high-precision and rapid production of nanostructures with pre-designed optical properties. A large number of functional nanostructures will be produced by rapidly changing the numerical coding information displayed on the mini LCD. The above techniques will also be used to fabricate optical circuits by adding light paths and controlling the light inside.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of optical devices and the development of an advanced laser fabrication capability. These new digital design and fabrication tools will enable the rapid design, verification, and fabrication of functional nanostructures and devices for telecommunication, sensing, and imaging applications. The digital display-enabled laser fabrication technique will drastically simplify the laser nano-manufacturing process and improve the process control. The single laser exposure and large-volume patterning process will reduce the manufacturing cost, making the process industrially and technically attractive. This research will also provide educational opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students.",
