 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human existence depends on soil, soil organisms and their processes; these are basic to sustaining environmental systems, agriculture and human well-being.  Microscopic nematodes are a key component to soil systems: they are unmatched in species diversity, often with thousands of individuals in a handful of soil.  Surprisingly, most nematode species remain hidden to science i.e. undiscovered and un-named; their species-specific environmental roles are generally not understood at a level useful to define, understand and sustain healthy ecosystems.   This project will develop new DNA/microscopy technology to implement novel, efficient, cost-saving approaches to nematode species discovery and description, including evolutionary and ecological relationships.  A California desert will be the experimental site for developing these tools, but the application and benefits are global.\r\n\r\nDramatically improving nematode identification tools will support soil ecologists and other biologists in the broader goals of understanding biological diversity and soil ecosystems for the benefit of humanity. The impact is broadened by developing online identification aids designed for non-specialists as well as for teaching tools. The project will train a graduate student and several undergraduates. Through small college collaboration it will provide research experience for female minority students.  New instructional tools and training approaches involving soils will be developed for grades 5-12.",
