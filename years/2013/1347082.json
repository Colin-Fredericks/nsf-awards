The Conference and Exposition, scheduled for November 10-13, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia, will address the scientific and engineering basis for tissue engineering-based repair, regeneration, and treatment of tissues and organs with focus areas of Cellular Engineering, Synthetic Biology, Cellular Reprogramming, and Rejuvenating Tissue/Organ Function, among others. The conference will advance knowledge within the broad, cross disciplinary community of those engaged in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine through the presentation of knew and transformative research. \r\n\r\nThe multidisciplinary focus of the conference and diversity of attendees has the ability to impact many sectors of engineering, science, and medicine. The global nature of TERMIS will provide for international perspectives and will lead to new international collaborations.\r\nThis conference has the ability to impact several levels of attendees, with particular focus on women, students and young investigators through the activities and events planned. Additionally, inclusion of underrepresented high school students will be a part of this conference event. This conference will inspire and help train the young future leaders of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",
