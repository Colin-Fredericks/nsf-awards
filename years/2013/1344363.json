An ad hoc committee will develop a roadmap of necessary advances in basic science and engineering capabilities needed to realize advanced manufacturing of chemicals using biological systems. Working at the interface of synthetic chemistry, metabolic engineering, molecular biology, and synthetic biology, the committee will identify key technical goals for this next-generation chemical manufacturing, identify the knowledge gaps which must be filled to meet those goals, and targets and timelines for achieving them. It will also consider the skills necessary to accomplish the roadmap goals, and what training opportunities are required to produce the cadre of skilled scientists and engineers needed. While focused on industrial manufacturing of chemicals, it is anticipated that the roadmap challenges will advance tools and techniques that are also required for new developments in health, energy, and environmental applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA new report from the National Research Council lays out a 10-year roadmap to accelerate the use of biological synthesis and engineering in chemical manufacturing.  Advances in synthetic biology -- the ability to read, write, and edit the DNA of microorganisms -- have enabled the design and construction of new and more efficient chemical reaction routes within cells, which opens the door for making chemicals that cannot presently be made at commercial scale through traditional chemical manufacturing processes.  Biomanufacturing of chemicals could also help address global challenges related to energy, climate change, agriculture, and environmental sustainability by reducing toxic byproducts, greenhouse gas emissions, and fossil fuel consumption in chemical production, the report says.\n\nIn 2012, bio-based product markets represented more than 2.2 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, or $353 billion in economic activity, and the markets for bio-based chemicals and industrial biotechnology for chemical manufacturing processes are growing roughly twice as fast as those in biomedicine or agriculture.  Despite the industry\u00c6s recent and projected growth, a number of technical and societal challenges must be overcome for biomanufacturing to be competitive with current chemical processes, the report says.  The roadmap identifies the necessary advancements in basic science and engineering that would expand the role of biotechnology in chemical manufacturing.\n\nProduct and capital costs are critical considerations for biomanufacturing.  Carbon in the form of fermentable sugars, derived from grains such as corn, is the primary raw material for the biological production of chemicals and often the largest single input cost -- up to as much as 65 percent -- of the total production cost, while fermentation itself represents the largest capital expense in bioprocessing.  One of the roadmap\u00c6s goals is increasing the widespread use of more abundant, more diverse, and less costly sources of carbon, such as from cellulosic biomass, natural gas, or biological methane.  Developments such as continuous fermentation to replace small-volume batch production will help to mitigate some capital costs at manufacturing facilities. \n\nThe roadmap also calls for further research and development to facilitate chemical transformation via biological synthesis and engineering.  Improvements in the ability to rapidly design enzymes and engineer their properties to carry out specific complex chemical transformations would significantly reduce the costs of scaling up biomanufacturing processes.  In addition, the number and range of microorganisms engineered for industrial use will need to increase with the diversity of products manufactured.\n\nManufacturing chemicals through biology might produce societal benefits while requiring fewer trade-offs between growth and sustainability than traditional chemical manufacturing, the committee said.  Products based on biological sources such as plants, algae, bacteria, yeast, fungi, or other organisms could replace many chemicals now derived from petroleum or other fossil fuels, which are a limited resource.  The specificity of biological synthesis could lead to high-purity products with fewer toxic byproducts and less waste.  The report stresses the need for efforts to inform the public of the nature of industrial biotechnology and of its societal benefits, and to make sure that concerns are communicated effectively between the public and other stakeholders.\n\nIn addition to scientific advances, a number of governance and societal factors will influence the industrialization of biology.  Industry norms and standards need to be established in areas such as read/write accuracy for DNA, data and machine technology specifications, and organism performance in terms of production rates and yields.  An updated regulatory regime is also needed to accelerate the safe commercialization of new host organisms, metabolic pathways, and..."
