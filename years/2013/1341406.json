These funds will go a long way in reducing the travel cost burden on students and postdocs and thereby improve student and postdoc participation in the conference. It is expected that 20 students and postdocs will benefit from these travel funds. Students and postdocs form an integral part of the IEEE community and conferences. They participate in different ways, including presenting papers and posters related to graduate and undergraduate research, attending technical sessions, participating in paper competitions, scholarship award functions and so on. Strong student and postdoc participation at IEEE CASE has motivated some to pursue graduate school options and even academic careers. NSF support will help ensure a high student and postdoc participation in IEEE CASE 2013. \r\n\r\nIEEE CASE provides an excellent opportunity for students and postdocs to broaden the impact of their work. Being an important annual conferences in the field of IE, it is a venue for US and international researchers in both academia and industry to showcase research results and exchange ideas. The venue of IEEE CASE will bring together practitioners, vendors, and researchers in all related disciplines in industry, academia, government, and other organizations. IEEE CASE is an excellent opportunity for students and postdocs to network with peers, potential employers, or future collaborators. Through the travel grant, the IEEE community will be able to increase the student and postdoc participation in the conference.\r\n\r\n&#8195;",
