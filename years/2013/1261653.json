The TLS system will support research and research training that requires the capability to rapidly map the surface topography of landforms, structure and vegetation with high spatial resolution (mm) in a well constrained positional reference frame.  The TLS systems will be available to support a wide range of geoscience and broader applications including studies of transient surface features (e.g, landslides), barrier beach processes, studies of earthquake rupture geometry and processes; volcanic deformation, bridge deformation in response to dynamic earth processes, tsunami generated landforms and related features, glacier topography, geological outcrop mapping, archaeological mapping and plant ecology.  The instruments will: 1) replace an aged and recently retired TLS system originally purchased with support from by OPP for polar project deployments; and 2) augment the current TLS pool with new technologies and a variety of new capabilities including longer range, full waveform digitization and more rapid scanning rates.   The systems will support geoscience education through incorporation into field camp exercises using TLS.  \r\n\r\n***",
