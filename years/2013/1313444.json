  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was aimed at understanding the atmospheric circulation of objects intermediate between giant planets and stars, known as the brown dwarfs.  These free-floating worlds are similar to Jupiter in size but much more massive, and they commonly have temperatures of 1000 degrees or more.  Observations show that brown dwarfs are covered by patchy clouds that vary over time, but the nature of the underlying atmospheric circulation that causes the cloud patchiness and its time variability is not understoood.  \n\nIntellectual Merit: In this project, we implemented the first-ever models of the global atmospheric circulation on brown dwarfs.  Being pathbreaking in nature, our models were idealized, having the goal of understanding the role of various processes in causing an atmospheric circulation and shaping its behavior.  In particular, we explored the effect on the atmospheric circulation of (1) interior convection impinging against an overlying atmosphere, (2) a \"hydrological\"  cycle in which latent heat release due to condensation of cloud constituents (silicate dust in the case of brown dwarfs) leads to thunderstorm-like phenomena, and (3) radiative feedbacks involving clouds.  Our work showed that all three of these processes can lead to a vigorous atmospheric circulation, with the first and third processes (interior convection and cloud radiative feedbacks) being most important. We constructed analytic theories for the strength of the atmospheric circulation that would result from the perturbing effects of interior convection, and we subsequently tested this theory with detailed, 3D numerical simulations of the atmospheric circulation, which showed that interior convection can induce large scale atmospheric waves, turbulence, and east-west jet streams that would, in the presence of cloud decks, lead to large-scale patchiness like that seen in observations.  To explore the specific effects of clouds on the circulation, we constructed a series of idealized models in 1D, 2D,and 3D to understand how clouds radiative effects might influence the thermal structure and whether this can itself drive an atmospheric circulation.  We demonstrated the existence of positive feedbacks in which the existence of patchy clouds causes perturbations to the radiative heating and cooling that, in turn, drive an overturning circulation that maintains the cloud patchiness.  Thus, an initially cloud-free atmosphere that would lack a circulation in the absence of clouds can spontaneously develop a vigorous, self-regenerating atmospheric circulation once clouds are seeded into the flow field.  We showed how this circulation, once it reaches equilibrium, can comprise a complex, time-variable pattern of turbulence, waves, and jet streams, which modulate the cloud patchiness.  We published a stream of peer-reviewed papers from this body of work, each of which explores these processes in detail and shows how each process, when considered in isolation, can influence or drive an atmospheric circulation.\n\nBroader Impacts: This project had important broader impacts in the areas of mentoring, education, and cross-disciplinary fertilization between fields.  The research performed for this project formed the core of former graduate student Xianyu Tan's Ph.D. thesis at the University of Arizona, with the PI serving as his Ph.D. advisor.  Thus this project was absolutely critical in training Mr. Tan, who obtained his Ph.D. in December 2018 and is now a postdoctoral scholar at Oxford.

We feel proud of this accomplishment and I think this pathbreaking effort will help to encourage more solar system and terrestrial atmospheric scientists to take on brown dwarfs as a field of study.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam Showman"
