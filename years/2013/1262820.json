 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources located in Charleston, SC. The proposed 12-week summer internship program will provide laboratory and field-based research expertise to eight undergraduate students from across the nation each summer for three years. The REU Site draws mentors, facilities, equipment and experiences from the closely situated Federal and state research institutions that comprise the Marine Resources Center at Fort Johnson, Charleston, South Carolina. Students will be required to design and complete independent mentor-guided research projects and will attend classes on statistics, scientific writing, and presentation skills to train them for successful future careers in the marine and environmental sciences. As final products of the program, students will be required to prepare both a written final report and an oral presentation on the findings from their projects. Oral presentations will be given as part of a day-long research colloquium. Following the program, students are encouraged to attend a professional meeting or conference to present their work.\r\nFunding supports student stipends, student travel to and from Charleston, dormatory housing during the program and some administrative expenses.",

The host institution for this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, funded by the National Science Foundation\u00c6s Division of Ocean Sciences, was the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources\u00c6 (SDNR) Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) located in Charleston, South Carolina, an institution which has been offering hands-on research experiences to minority undergraduates dating back to 1989.  The MIMES Program provided a great breadth of laboratory and field-based research experiences and exposure to expertise not only at the SCDNR facilities, but also through the contributions of partnering Federal and academic institutions across the Fort Johnson Marine Resources Center.  The structure of this summer internship program centered around an intensive program of mentor-guided research and classroom instruction ultimately intended to increase the representation of minorities in the marine and environmental sciences.  The provision of mentor-assisted independent research projects has been well-documented as an effective means of exposing students to science and for preparing them for careers in related disciplines.\n\nThe MIMES Program specifically aimed to recruit undergraduate students that were limited in their access to marine and environmental science disciplines.  The major goals of the MIMES Program were to:  (1) Increase the number of undergraduate minorities who choose marine or environmental science as a profession; (2) Create opportunities for minority undergraduate students to complete independent, mentor-guided, research projects; (3) Provide minority students with opportunities to interact with successful scientific minority role models (including former MIMES Program participants) through invited special seminars and interactions with researchers from across the MRC; (4) Develop the skills and self-confidence of minority students needed for successful performance in advanced levels of study; (5) Offer continued mentorship beyond the scope of the 12-week summer program (e.g., by providing information regarding opportunities specifically intended for minority undergraduates, offering letters of recommendation as requested, encouraging students to pursue other internships, advanced degrees, and careers in marine and environmental science fields).\n\nUndergraduates began submitting their application early in the calendar year, in advance of a mid-March deadline.  Successful students were contacted in mid-April and introduced through conference calls to their prospective mentors and research projects individually tailored to the interests and educational backgrounds of the students under consideration.  Students that accepted offers of internships (8 students each year) arrived in Charleston in mid-May to begin an intensive summer of field- and laboratory-based marine and environmental scientific research, as well as classroom instruction, field trips and social events at which they were introduced to REU students from other concurrent Charleston-based internship programs.  Holistically the MIMES Program aimed to provide each intern with a realistic experience of life as a full-time professional research scientist.  The Program culminated in a one day research colloquium at which each intern gave an oral presentation of their research project to their program peers, as well as to other researchers from institutions across the Fort Johnson Marine Resources Center campus, at the MRRI Auditorium.  Interns were presented with a certificate of completion at the end of the colloquium, and the program ended with the decomp..."
