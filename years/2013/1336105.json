 "awd_abstract_narration": "1336105\r\nWeber\r\n\r\nCombustion reactions are of great importance for basic combustion science as well as for the development of efficient and clean engines.  Highly strained hydrocarbons are of particular interest since they are candidates for high-energy density fuels.  Established techniques for flame composition analysis, such as VUV photoionization mass spectrometry, IR or Raman spectroscopy are difficult because either the molecules can isomerizes on their way to a detector, or the high temperature of the flame makes spectra too complex to analyze.  This project develops a novel technique, Rydberg Fingerprint Spectroscopy, to identify the molecular compounds in the flame.  Following calibration and comparison with data from a molecular beam photoionization implementation, the technique will use a radar method for in-flame analysis.  The technique enables non-intrusive and in-situ detection of complex molecular species and reveals highly resolved spectra that are molecular structure sensitive while being insensitive toward temperature.  Consequently, the method is promising for sampling flame components at the high temperature of a flame.  We explore the combustion of quadricyclane and norbornadiene, highly strained hydrocarbons with the formula C7H8.  The proposed new method for flame diagnostics can also be used for future combustion science studies and for commercial implementations.  The project will involve one graduate student and form the basis of the student?s dissertation.  The PI will work with Leadership Alliance, a national consortium headquartered at Brown University enhancing undergraduate students? interest in pursuing graduate education and success in their careers.",
