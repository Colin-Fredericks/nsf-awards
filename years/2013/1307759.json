The approach is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the\r\noperational parameters and spatial resolution enhancement techniques required for this purpose. The\r\nfour spatial resolution enhancement techniques to be investigated include threshold discrimination,\r\ndensity gradient, fast logic, and columnar sensor medium techniques. Each of these enhancement\r\ntechniques will be investigated for feasibility and effectiveness. Boron carbide diode sensors will also be\r\ncharacterized experimentally with respect to related operational parameters for these spatial resolution\r\nenhancement techniques. The combination of these results will provide a basis for the development of a\r\nstate-of-the-art neutron imager. The boron carbide will also be tested through direct coupling with Timepix\r\nQTPX-262k to test its functionality and improvement of current state of the art techniques utilizing\r\nestablished front end electronics and signal processing methods.",
