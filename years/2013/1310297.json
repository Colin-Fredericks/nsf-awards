 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Nikolay Dimitrov at the State University of New York at Binghamton to design and develop an all-electrochemical synthetic approach that enables the production of thin and continuous nanoporous catalysts with tunable thickness and interconnected porosity.  The synthetic protocols include electrodeposition of continuous single-phase alloy films followed by selective oxidative removal of the less-noble component (de-alloying).  The de-alloying process completes the fabrication of nanoporous metals (NPMs) with thicknesses of less than 20 nm.  The synthetic method results in reliable composition control and high processing efficiency.  During different stages of the fabrication, the catalyst surface area, structure and composition are confirmed by electrochemical methods, and also by STM/AFM, SEM, and EDS.  The NPMs are then either used directly as catalysts or are electrochemically functionalized with a sub-nanometer thick layer of catalytically active metals or alloys.  The coating is made by state-of-the art electrochemical approaches, ensuring complete and uniform coverage over the NPM matrix.  The catalysts are assessed for activity and durability in established lab tests for the oxygen reduction reaction, organic fuel oxidation, and/or nitrate electro-reduction.  The best catalysts are then assessed in a semi-industrial environment.  Qualified undergraduates from underrepresented groups are offered summer research activities in the investigator?s research group.\r\n \r\nThe NSF Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Nikolay Dimitrov at the State University of New York at Binghamton to introduce an all-electrochemical synthetic approach for the fabrication of a new class of catalytically active materials based on nanoporous metals as an alternative to the most established nanoparticle catalysts for energy and environmental applications.  Chemical methods of synthesis are sometimes problematic as they can produce by-products and inhibitors to catalytic activity, that must be removed by the use of additional chemicals and costly procedures.  One advantage of the electrochemical fabrication of catalysts is that it introduces a higher level of control and environmentally friendly routines.  Such approaches rely on metal(s) reduction performed by applying voltage or current so that further treatment and/or removal of unwanted chemicals or contaminants is not needed.  The catalysts designed and fabricated in this research will be used for industrially-important catalytic reactions related to fuel cell applications and environmental remediation.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in advanced materials processing, along with analytical and characterizational methods at the interface between chemistry and materials science.",
