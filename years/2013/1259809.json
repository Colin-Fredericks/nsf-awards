 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide scholarships for students with academic merit and unmet financial need pursuing Associates of Science (AS) and Associates of Engineering Science (AES) degrees and transfer opportunities with a concentration in STEM disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering as well as their related fields at the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC). Over the course of three years, 45 - 60 STEM Scholars will be chosen and will benefit from the academic and financial support needed to persist in their endeavors while at CCC, and successfully transfer to a four-year institution. The scholarship program supports students in the second year of studies, covers expenses related to enrollment for their Fall, Spring and Summer semesters, and provides support for enrollment in a class at a Chicago area four-year institution (their transfer destination) during the scholarship period. As STEM Scholars, participants will have access to a wide range of academic and student support services as well as leadership development and community service opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide CCC with opportunities to continue to develop and expand these agreements with four-year institutions on behalf of all CCC STEM students. It will document effective practices for promoting success among a high-need, diverse, urban student population pursuing STEM degrees and serve as a model for other institutions.",

We are proud to report that we have been able to work with a group of students whose diversity reflects that of the City Colleges of Chicago.\n\nFinancial Need:  Applicants in the program are required to complete a FAFSA to demonstrate their financial need.  99% of the total STEM scholar cohort (112/113) met all of the academic and financial requirements to keep their scholarship for each of the semesters during which they were enrolled in the program.\nCompletion: The STEM Scholars program moves students towards degree completion and transfer to a four-year institution.

This activity is seen as beneficial for students who are on a path to graduate with a bachelor?s degree in STEM fields. 24 of the total STEM Scholars cohort who are placed in summer REU/Internship programare listed in the following table:\nThe volunteering took many forms, such as volunteering as a judge for the Chicago area science fair competition, and tutoring and mentoring students at the k-12 Chicago private as well as public schools.

Chicago, having multiple colleges, universities, and professional societies, gives our STEM scholars numerous opportunities to learn about the activities of professional scientists and engineers.  Many of our scholars went to public presentations of the Chicago Council on Science and Technology.
