 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, building on the success and best practices of prior ATE projects, advances a grade 9-12 STEM Academy model by creating, implementing, and evaluating a career pathway and course sequence in digital engineering technology & design. The project further scales this blended instructional model for national dissemination and engages minority students historically underrepresented in STEM careers from 30 urban, suburban, and rural Connecticut high schools.  The curriculum being developed is embedded with experiential learning to build competency and workforce readiness across all fields of technology supported by the ATE Program. Project activities include: program development and improvement, educator professional development, and curriculum and educational materials development for national dissemination.  The project is also conducting a comparative study to examine student STEM interest and engagement and the development of 21st century competencies and skills for successful transition from high school to college in Academy vs. non-Academy project sites.\r\n\r\nThe project responds to a critical national workforce need - a highly educated and competent technical workforce prepared to compete effectively in the global economy, and has the potential to revitalize the learning environment in 30 Connecticut high schools with diverse student populations, through the creation of a career pathway in digital engineering technology and design.",
