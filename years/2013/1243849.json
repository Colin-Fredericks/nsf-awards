 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Among the many ways that genes are regulated in eukaryotes is via a process termed as alternative polyadenylation; this process entails the differential choice of sites along a primary RNA transcript at which the messenger RNAs will end (and to which the canonical poly(A) tail will be added).  Previous NSF-supported research resulted in the discovery of a novel class of alternative polyadenylation sites that are prevalent in genes associated with stress responses in plants.  These sites are predicted to reflect novel gene expression and regulatory mechanisms.  To test this prediction, the formation and properties of mRNAs that end at these sites will be studied.  The hypotheses to be tested in this project are:  mRNAs that end at these novel sites are formed by canonical mechanisms of polyadenylation; mRNAs that end at these sites alter the functionalities of the associated mRNAs; and polyadenylation at these sites is required for the functions of genes that possess such sites.  This research will involve biochemical assays, high throughput sequencing of DNA tags that query mRNA-poly(A) junctions as well as the positions of RNA polymerase II along the genome, transient gene expression studies in Nicotiana benthamiana, and experiments utilizing Arabidopsis mutants and transgenic plants.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The proposed research addresses a new mode of regulation of genes involved in responses of plants to stress.  The knowledge gained from these studies will apply to most crop plants, and it is reasonable to expect that new strategies for managing disease and abiotic stress in crop plants will be forthcoming.  The research involves a wide range of approaches; trainees will thus gain first-hand experience in biochemistry, genomics and computational biology, and molecular genetics.  The research methods and results will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate classes at the University of Kentucky.  Additionally, the methods and results will be made available to faculty at a number of undergraduate-focused institutions as part of outreach efforts to develop curricular modules for high throughput DNA sequencing and genomics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project dealt with an interesting class of messenger RNAs that are made in plants in the course of gene expression; this class is called \"non-stop mRNAs\", so named because they lack an important feature of the mRNA (the translation termination, or stop, codon).  These are of interest because, at first glance, they should not be functional.  Thus, it is curious as to why they are made in the first place.  In this project, studies were conducted to determine how these RNAs are made, how they are handled by the cell, and how they contribute to the overall growth and health of the plant.  The results that were obtained tell us the following:\n\n1.  \"Non-stop mRNAs\" seem to be made in the same general manner as other (\"normal\") mRNAs in plants.  This is interesting, since it suggests that a common machinery may yield different outcomes.\n\n2.  \"Non-stop mRNAs\" are somewhat less stable than normal mRNAs.  This is interesting because it suggests that plants divert some mRNAs into non-productive outcomes in the normal course of gene expression. \n\n3.  The production of \"Non-stop mRNAs\" is increased in a number of stress conditions, such as disease, salt, drought, and the like.  This is interesting because it suggests that plants divert increasing quantities of mRNAs into non-productive outcomes in response to stress.\n\nTaken together, these findings lead to a model in which plants fine-tune gene expression by balancing outputs between productive and non-productive outcomes.  This is an important addition to the larger understanding of how plants control gene expression and will help in creating new strategies for improving the capacity of crop plants to withstand different stresses.\n\nThis project supported the training of a postdoctoral scientist, a high school teacher, and three undergraduate students.  The high school teacher was from a rural school in south central Kentucky, and the undergraduates from the University of Kentucky, Centre College, and Kentucky State University (an HBCU).  The project also supported participation in workshops focused on developing curricula for bringing next generation DNA sequencing into undergraduate laboratories and classes.  The Principal Investigator was an instructor in these workshops, and interacted with more than 25 faculty from undergraduate-focused institutions (including a number of Minority-Serving Institutions).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Arthur G Hunt"
