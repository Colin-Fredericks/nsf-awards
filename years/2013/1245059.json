 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of Flipping Calculus is to transform the teaching and learning of the material in Calculus. Flipping a course describes an instructional approach in which the delivery of a majority of the content is moved outside of class, via online videos, lecture notes, and readings, while homework, such as problem sets, labs, and applications, are shifted into the classroom. Instructors in Flipped Calculus are devoting class time to supporting small groups of students who are engaged in collaborative discussions and problem solving.  Senior faculty are creating a library of videotaped lessons which correspond to key calculus concepts.  In addition, they are developing and refining guided problem sets and assessments to evaluate the progress made by the students.  Eventually, a website for flipping calculus will be created, which will host the videos and course materials, available for broad dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe project activities are based on research on how students learn and are designed to actively engage students in Calculus so they obtain a deeper understanding of the material, ultimately remembering and applying the skills and concepts they learn.  This project involves at least six mathematics faculty members and is having a direct impact on more than 200 students during the first year of the project and upwards of 300 students in year two. The project leaders are extending the impact by presenting their findings and materials at regional and national conferences, sharing the videotapes, problem sets, labs and discussion questions on a website dedicated to flipping Calculus, as well as publishing articles in mathematics education journals.",
