 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO) is investigating how mountain soil and regolith properties develop over geologic time, and interact with shorter-term climate variability and ecosystem behavior.  This understanding is used to predict how environmental change, including human disturbances, fire, pests and changes in climate influence water resources, material flows and forest health.  We are pioneering low-cost, accurate measurement systems and use of the measurements to drive advanced earth systems modeling for predictions.  We work closely with regional stakeholders and use our results to assess options available to resource managers to enhance management of forests, water and other ecosystem services, given environmental change.\r\n\r\nThe SSCZO is also a community platform for research on critical-zone (CZ) processes, both locally and as part of the broader CZO national network. It lies along a steep elevation transect where precipitation grades from dominantly rain to dominantly snow and ecosystems range from oak savannah biomes to subalpine forests. Spatial gradients in CZ properties and processes permit substitution of space for time, making the SSCZO an excellent natural laboratory for studying how the CZ responds to disturbance and how the water cycle drives CZ processes. SSCZO research involves a core SSCZO team from 6 campuses, plus collaborators and cooperators from other institutions who use SSCZO data and other resources in their research. SSCZO resources include 4 focal sites spanning a 3000-meter elevation range with gradients in climate, regolith properties, soils, vegetation and material cycles. Measurements are intensive and detailed, including 4 flux towers, meteorological stations, soil lysimeters, groundwater wells, and over 1000 continuous sensors for snow depth, soil moisture, streamflow, water quality and sap flow.\r\n\r\nThe SSCZO provides a platform for research in a landscape with vital importance to society, yet poorly understood in its potential response to climate warming. The twin threats of a changing climate and land-use practices raise fundamental questions about the sustainability of CZ services in the semi-arid U.S. West, which depends heavily on seasonally snow-covered mountains for many of these services. The Sierra Nevada provides ecosystem services, ranging from water to biodiversity, to a large fraction of California's and thus the nation's population. SSCZO partnerships with federal, state, and local resource-management agencies show the interest that decision makers have in using both research results and SSCZO technology to improve predictive capabilities. SSCZO will provide data and lessons to enhance the science experience of thousands of middle- and high-school students, several undergraduate students and the public.",

The Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) has met the science objectives proposed in the 2013 award, and opened up new areas of inquiry for Critical Zone science. First, we have developed methods for measuring, characterizing, and understanding the spatial patterns of critical-zone properties across the landscape, as well as associated critical-zone processes. For example, our continuous, multi-site, multi-year water-balance measurements provided the first accurate, spatially gridded data on evapotranspiration, root-accessible water storage, and runoff in mountain basins. Using Landsat data for scaling, we extended these records from 1985 to the present. Second, we have determined how climate and landscape properties interact to modulate physical, chemical, and biological interactions in the critical zone. For example, we found significant subsurface carbon losses persisting decades after high-severity wildfire; however, in undisturbed or less-disturbed areas, this deeper carbon pool was more resilient. Third, we have determined rates of change for regolith properties, highlighting the interplay between lithology, vegetation, and subsurface critical-zone structure, and the influence on shorter-term critical-zone processes. An example is our finding across multiple sites that strain causes changes in subsurface volume, and thus produces more porosity than does dissolution of minerals. While chemical weathering is relatively uniform, spatially variable patterns of porosity are dominated by processes causing strain. Fourth, our team has used the 2011-15 drought and coincident wildfires as \"natural experiments\" to better understand how the critical zone will respond to climate-driven perturbations, and how management actions can modulate those responses. We found that forest die-off was closely tied to gradual depletion of root-accessible subsurface water over that four-year period. This provides a way to predict future forest resilience based on scenarios of precipitation and forest density. Fifth, we developed measurement and modeling tools to better study the critical zone. For example, we integrated satellite remote sensing with spatially distributed wireless-sensor networks to develop timely, accurate gridded water and landscape data. We also developed use of seismic refraction for determining spatial porosity and thus weathering patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts. </strong>Research outputs from the CZO are having important, direct outcomes on managing natural lands for both landscape resiliency and multiple ecosystem services in a rapidly changing climate and disturbance regime. We have also educated multiple students and postdoctoral researchers, launched former students, early career faculty, and staff on productive careers that will make a difference in nature-based solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate warming, and adapt to the change that does occur. The understanding we provided of mountain water balances, built on the Sierra Nevada-wide scaling of our continuous, accurate evapotranspiration measurements, is transformational for predicting: i) root-accessible water storage, and thus drought resilience, ii) runoff changes from disturbance by fire on natural lands and mechanical fuels treatments in forests, and iii) runoff and flooding in mixed-rain-snow storms. These have found application in support of decision making in water resources and forest management. For example, the California Department of Water Resources and local agencies are using our technology and tools in next-generation measurement and decision-support systems. CZO outcomes were also the foundation for our Center for Ecosystem Climate Solutions, and the data and tools that we developed to inform the multi-billion dollar per year challenge of restoring overstocked forests across the western U.S. to more-sustainable conditions. Beyond the university education, our team brought school children out to measure and understand the critical zone. We presented dozens of public and professional talks, were frequently featured or quoted in radio, television, and print media locally, nationally and internationally, and produced two documentary films featuring outcomes of our research. One film was shown on streaming services, with the second distributed on PBS nationwide. A third is to be released in 2023.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roger&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bales</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1331939/1331939_10283978_1680478635024_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1331939/1331939_10283978_1680478635024_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tree mortality from drought\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1331939/1331939_10283978_1680478635024_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tree mortality from drought\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Widespread tree mortality in the southern Sierra Nevada during the water-year 2012-16 drought.

Fourth, our team has used the 2011-15 drought and coincident wildfires as \"natural experiments\" to better understand how the critical zone will respond to climate-driven perturbations, and how management actions can modulate those responses. We found that forest die-off was closely tied to gradual depletion of root-accessible subsurface water over that four-year period. This provides a way to predict future forest resilience based on scenarios of precipitation and forest density. Fifth, we developed measurement and modeling tools to better study the critical zone. For example, we integrated satellite remote sensing with spatially distributed wireless-sensor networks to develop timely, accurate gridded water and landscape data. We also developed use of seismic refraction for determining spatial porosity and thus weathering patterns.\n\nBroader impacts. Research outputs from the CZO are having important, direct outcomes on managing natural lands for both landscape resiliency and multiple ecosystem services in a rapidly changing climate and disturbance regime. We have also educated multiple students and postdoctoral researchers, launched former students, early career faculty, and staff on productive careers that will make a difference in nature-based solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate warming, and adapt to the change that does occur. The understanding we provided of mountain water balances, built on the Sierra Nevada-wide scaling of our continuous, accurate evapotranspiration measurements, is transformational for predicting: i) root-accessible water storage, and thus drought resilience, ii) runoff changes from disturbance by fire on natural lands and mechanical fuels treatments in forests, and iii) runoff and flooding in mixed-rain-snow storms. These have found application in support of decision making in water resources and forest management. For example, the California Department of Water Resources and local agencies are using our technology and tools in next-generation measurement and decision-support systems. CZO outcomes were also the foundation for our Center for Ecosystem Climate Solutions, and the data and tools that we developed to inform the multi-billion dollar per year challenge of restoring overstocked forests across the western U.S. to more-sustainable conditions. Beyond the university education, our team brought school children out to measure and understand the critical zone. We presented dozens of public and professional talks, were frequently featured or quoted in radio, television, and print media locally, nationally and internationally, and produced two documentary films featuring outcomes of our research. One film was shown on streaming services, with the second distributed on PBS nationwide. A third is to be released in 2023.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger C Bales"
