 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project presents novel approaches to fabricating dry, removable, reusable adhesives on substrates using scalable fiber spinning methodologies.  The proposed work differs drastically from other research programs to replicate bio inspired adhesive mechanisms, which are based on the use of aligned carbon nanotubes, photolithography, chemical etching, and time-consuming batch micro/nano molding processes.  The new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle free nanofiber spinning processes, which will replace the more expensive approaches such as micro/nano fabrication process. The research incorporates interdisciplinary mechano-electro-rheology for improving understanding of dry adhesives.  Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the spinning process.  Introduction of nozzleless electrospinning polymer blending and equal-channel angular pressing will combine processing stages such as solution preparation, spinning and spin-finish in one production line, significantly reducing processing time and costs.  Prototype polymer adhesive fabrics will be characterized tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.    \r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be significant improvements in dry, reusable adhesive products for target markets already identified and studied.   Improved adhesive joining for composites in automotive applications would lead to weight reduction by enabling replacement of metal body panels with lighter composites, increasing fuel economy and saving energy. In consumer adhesives, the value proposition for dry adhesives would improve product safety, reduce environmental impact from messy liquids, and improve educational experiences for children. In labels, an easily removable adhesive would eliminate residue glue, in turn simplifying and increasing recyclability of packaging and reducing waste in landfills. In addition, new adhesive products based on nanofiber spinning will lead to new applications in markets not yet explored in biomedical, electronics, robotics, tires and military segments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project aims to advance the platform technology of electrospinning aligned nanofibers for producing \"dry\" reusable adhesives with strong static shear adhesion and low peel strength.  Electrospinning is a commercialized process and this textile adhesive forming strategy is drastically different from other research programs to replicate prohibitively expensive biomimicking adhesives such as using lithography, chemical etching, time-consuming batch micro/nano molding processes, and other multi-step manufacturing approaches.  The project produced a prototype scale-up that demonstrates production of 8\" by 11\" dry adhesive films made by nozzle-free electrospinning of aligned nanofibers and supported a sampling program with strategic commercialization partners who are industrial leaders in adhesive, sealant, glue, tape and label segments, and target customers that are recognized leaders in rubber and tire, automotive wiring, materials and biomedical segments.  The project also produced two invention disclosures, one non-provisional patent application, three conference presentations, and provided training for one postdoctoral staff scientist and one graduate student.  Economic analyses of production costs were established during the Phase 1 project.  We estimate that at commercial scale we could produce films for $50 - $100/meter2, depending on throughput rate and film thickness, with opportunities for optimization with continued process development.  Static shear was a minimum of 35-40 N/cm2.  Under dynamic shear test conditions performed by an ASTM qualified dynamic shear instrument, a minimum of 20 N/cm2 was recorded. with marked upside potential depending on the failure mode and facestucks used.  The AAI samples also showed good shear adhesion with easy peel on a wide range of substrates including metal, glass, painted walls, whiteboards, cardboards, cured rubber pads, and papers.  The nanoscale mechanical interlocking adhesion between mating faces was exceptionally strong with a minimum value of 45 N/cm2 caused by cohesive failure of the aluminum facestuck and not the nanofibers.\n\n \n\nThe broader impact of this project includes jobs creation in a strategically located materials and manufacturing center of our nation.  The Akron-Cleveland metroplex has approximately 3 million residents.  This provides a broadly diverse workforce - with unique opportunities for intellectual capital interactions, with close to 2800 polymer and material companies in Ohio.  the project brings significant improvements in dry, reusable adhesive products for target markets already identified and studied, improves product safety, reduces environmental impact from messy liquids, and improves educational experiences for children.  In labels, an easy removable dry adhesive will eliminiate residue glue, in turn simplifying and increasing recyclability of packaging and reducing waste in landfills.  In addition, new adhesive products based on nanofiber spinning will lead to markets not yet explored in biomedical, electronics, robotics, tire sidewalls, sensors embedment, and milatary segments.  It will forge links between sustainable manufacturing and biological sciences, which create value for a knowledge-based economy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry M Rosenbaum"
