 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to investigators in the School of Engineering and Applied Science working with investigators in the School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.  This award is cofunded by the Materials Surface Engineering program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical & Manufacturing Innovation. The major aim of this research is to overcome the classic biological problems encountered with current vascular graft materials such as expandable polytetrafluoroethylene based stents.  The scientific goal of this project is in developing a fundamental understanding of the biological responses to thin film Nitinol (TFN) based materials.  The TFN contains both a biomimicking Titanium Oxide (TiO) surface and an intelligently designed micro porosity pattern. The investigators hypothesized that a negatively charged TiO surface better mimics the charge structure of the native vascular system as compared to existing graft materials, and thus reducing thrombosis while promoting re-endothelialization. This biomimicking process is further enhanced with intelligently designed micro-pores that promote direct cellular communication between the neointima forming on the lumen side of the device and the underlying native vessel while preventing neointimal hyperplasia. The proposed research represents an interdisciplinary collaboration addressing a significant limitation of covered stents and other vascular graft materials available today. The program includes educational activities to inspire students' (from K-12 to graduate level) interest in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award provides a potential new materials approach to treat a wide range of vascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease, which affects over 10 million Americans. Recently, the use of expandable polytetrafluoroethylene covered stents for treating peripheral arterial disease has increased, but still has a 35% failure rate within 1 year suggesting significant shortcomings with this type of graft material.  Three of the primary failure mechanisms are graft thrombosis, edge stenosis and lack of re-endothelialization. To overcome these problems, the researches of this project will use biomimicry and intelligent design to develop a new hemocompatible material. This research project will provide opportunities for a wide range of underrepresented students from K-12 to graduate levels. The K-12 students are encouraged to consider science and engineering studies during outreach presentations at local schools twice a year. The investigators of this project will participate with the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity program at UCLA to provide a diverse group (4-6) of undergraduate students in conducting research on this project for one quarter.  Additionally, this project will use a peer mentoring process in a collaborative environment to educate undergraduates on new cutting-edge technologies while encouraging them to consider graduate studies.",
