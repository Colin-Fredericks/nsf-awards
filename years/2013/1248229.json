 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a custom-designed microbial biocatalyst for the renewable production of high value terpenoid biochemicals. Terpenoid biochemicals derived from essential oils are used in numerous consumer products and as food additives. Many of them accumulate in nature in various stereo-isomeric forms, each of which possesses unique properties and applications. These molecules are believed to function principally in ecological roles, serving as herbivore-feeding deterrents, antifungal defenses, and pollinator attractants. The research objective is to develop a fermentation process for biosynthetic production allowing increased adoption of such natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals. Multivariate-Modular  Metabolic engineering (MMME) approaches will be used to transfer the natural biosynthetic  pathway from the plant to a bacterial host and to optimize the metabolic flux for the overproduction at a commercially viable level. A  high-productivity strain is anticipated, suitable for continued commercialization efforts. Overall, this project, if successful, will provide a new sustainable production route for these natural chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a microbial process for the economic and sustainable production of high value terpenoid biochemicals. These terpenoid biochemicals have applications in a variety of industries ranging from agro-chemicals, petro-chemicals and flavor and fragrance (F&F) chemicals; specifically they are commonly used as flavor agents, bio- herbicides, sprout inhibitors and as bio-pest repellents.  In all, the total potential addressable markets exceed  $3  Billion.  Microbial  production  will  benefit  society  by  improving  the  renewability  of  the production   process  and  by  relocating  production   from  overseas  to  the  US.  In  summary,  the development  of microbes capable of producing the target will enable sustainable production of the target  as  well  as  create  jobs  in  the  US.  This research  will  develop  generalizable  microbial  strain engineering techniques for the high-volume production of natural products through a sustainable manufacturing process.",
