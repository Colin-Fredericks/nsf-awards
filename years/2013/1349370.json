 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent discovery that rodents have a well-developed magnetic compass sense has stimulated interest in the neural mechanism responsible for detecting and processing magnetic information in mammals. The proposed research will use electrophysiological recording from individual neurons in the brains of free-moving Long-Evans rats to characterize responses to an earth-strength magnetic field.  To maximize the likelihood of detecting these responses, initial recordings will be carried out when rats are first introduced to novel surroundings and deprived of alternate directional cues.  One goal of this research is to identify specific classes of spatial neurons that receive magnetic input, for example, head direction cells.  A second goal is to determine which, if either, of the primary mechanisms responsible for detecting the earth?s field in migratory birds and other animals is functioning in rats. One mechanism involves small, magnetically sensitive particles of the mineral magnetite and the second a specialized photoreceptor in which the response to light is influenced by the magnetic field.  The photoreceptor-based detector, for which there is preliminary evidence in mice and rats, is thought to involve a quantum process that could contribute to the development of new technologies such as quantum computing.  Furthermore, input from either mechanism could play a fundamental, and previously unrecognized, role in mammalian spatial perception.  The broader impact of this interdisciplinary research will: (1) extend to fields as diverse as biophysics, engineering, cognitive psychology, and sensory ecology, (2) contribute to a better understanding of animal models used in biomedical research (e.g., mouse water maze assays used to study Alzheimer?s disease and other forms of dementia), and (3) provide interdisciplinary training for diverse student populations and postdoctoral fellows.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funded research investigated the response of head direction cells (HDCs) in the post-subiculum (PoS) and anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) to the magnetic field (MF) in free-moving rats.  Recordings were carried out in four horizontal alignments of an earth-strength MF -- magnetic North (magN) = geographic north (gN), east (gE), south (gS), or west (gW) -- with or without one or more visual landmarks (LMs) attached to the arena wall; visual LMs consisted of white posterboard rectangles with black geometric shapes superimposed. \n\nResponses to magnetic cues in a variety of animals have been shown to be light-dependent, and sensitive to low-level radio frequency (RF) fields.  Design of the apparatus for the rat recordings included electromagnetic shielding to screen out ambient RF noise, as well as EMI/RFI line filters to reduce RF emissions from power cables and signal lines that penetrated the shielding.  Efforts to reduce background levels of RF fields included working with the manufacturer of the Cheetah 5 recording system (Neuralynx, Inc.) to reduce RF emission from the head stage cable that connected electrodes to a Saturn commutator. \n\nRecordings provided preliminary evidence that the preferred firing directions (PFDs) of HDCs in the ADN would anchor to the magnetic field with or without visual landmarks present, but surprisingly would do so in only three of the four magnetic field alignments, i.e., magN = gN, gE, gS, but not magN = gW.  Instead the PFDs in the west field (magN = gW) tended to be aligned in the same absolute (topographic) direction as the PFD in the previous trial, regardless of the stimulus condition in that trial.  The topographic responses in the west field condition were especially surprising because in between recordings sessions the rat was removed from the arena, the paper covering the floor of the arena was replaced, the rat was disoriented by rotating it 10X in a light-tight transfer container, and the magnetic field alignment (with or without an associated LM) was shifted to a new alignment (modulus 90?).  It is also noteworthy that the failure of HDCs to anchor in the west field condition occurred even if the MF was paired with a visual LM, e.g., when the LM was positioned 90? clockwise of magN in each alignment of the MF.\n\nWe spent 2+ years after the end of NSF funding working to eliminate the ?west field effect?, without success.  However, a recent breakthrough in related mouse water maze (WM) experiments provided the key to the problem with the rat recordings as well.  In the mouse WM experiments, we have been investigating the transfer of a learned direction relative to the MF to a novel array of visual landmarks.  Although transfer of the learned directional response from the MF to LMs appeared to occur, the response was bimodal and shifted by ~45? relative to the trained direction.  We have observed similar 45? shifted, bimodal orientation relative to the trained magnetic direction in past experiments with rodents that were exposed to intermittent bursts of low-level RF noise (unpubl. data).  Changing the grounding configuration in the WM experiments and, more specifically, connecting the output of RF filters installed on the cables powering the magnetic coils to a separate earth ground, eliminated the 45? shift.    \n\nIn the rat recordings, improvements in the shielding of the testing room along with changes in the grounding configuration, also appear to have eliminated the ?west field? problem.  These findings provide initial evidence that HDCs anchor to the MF, with or without a paired visual LM, and that reintroduction of RF noise disrupts this response.  However, additional experiments are needed to replicate the HDC recordings before the findings are published. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John B Phillips"
