This is possible by implementing massively distributed intelligent optimization architecture with coordinated hierarchical and distributed control that can interact with grid devices. This approach will allow the transmission and distribution network to operate efficiently satisfying various grid level objectives simultaneously and yet achieving global optimality conditions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impact is the ability of the proposed infrastructure to transform the power grid functionalities that has substantial economic (improved grid efficiency and optimal supply and demand elasticity), societal (sustainable, reliable and resilient infrastructure) and educational value (new curriculum methods and generation and retention of next generation global workforce) which is important for developing next generation power grid.",
