 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processing geometry efficiently is crucial for many domains including computer-aided design, scientific computing, urban planning, and cultural heritage preservation, to name just a few.  As a consequence, the amount of geometric data generated and stored is rapidly increasing.  Raw geometric data comes in a variety of forms (e.g., range images, LIDAR data, and volumetric data), and most commonly is converted to unstructured meshes which enjoy many attractive features but inherently limit efficiency and accuracy of algorithms for geometric processing, processing data on surfaces and physical simulation.  Conversion of geometry to an image-like, regularly sampled form has been demonstrated to have significant advantages in these contexts.  Mesh parameterization is the fundamental technique used both for resampling surfaces on structured grids and for mapping data to surfaces.  Global parameterization algorithms can generate seamless tilings of arbitrary surfaces with quadrilateral domains enabling regular resampling everywhere excluding isolated points.  The continuing progress in this area has led to increasingly reliable and high-quality algorithms, yet no fully robust automatic method is available yet.  The PI's goal in this project is to tackle this problem and to develop fundamental algorithms for global parameterization supported by rigorous analysis, as well as robust and scalable implementations of these algorithms.  Specifically, he aims to address the following closely interconnected problems: Quality (optimization of suitably chosen distortion measures, and explicit guarantees on local distortion); Robustness (direct parameterization and resampling of possibly noisy geometric data avoiding intermediate mesh representations, with guarantees on the resulting parameterization structure); and Scalability and Efficiency  (to enable meshes with hundreds of millions of sample points to be processed on a desktop computer).  Although the PI will build on the substantial recent advances in the area, achieving the stated goals will require rethinking some of the core aspects of the problem.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   This research will lead not only to the development of practical and efficient algorithms, but also to advances in our fundamental understanding of related geometric problems (for example, intrinsic limitations on distortion and geometric resampling).  The software the PI plans to develop has the potential to enable new approaches to a variety of tasks in geometric processing, which can be performed on structured grids and in the parametric domain if a robust tool for parameterization can be assumed to be available.  The interest in robust and scalable parameterization techniques extends far beyond the domain of geometric processing, to many domains of science and engineering where complex geometric models are used (e.g., large-scale fluid flow simulation in complex geometry, which requires high-order approximation of surfaces extracted from different sources).",

It is needed for mapping data to surfaces (textures, reflection data, material properties etc) for subsequent use, e.g., in rendering, physical simulation and statistical analysis.  The main goal of the project was to develop robust algorithms for global parametrization of  sampled surfaces, improve parametrization quality and apply parametrization methods to approximation of surfaces with high-order patches, commonly used in computer-aided design for manufactoring and computer animation.  in addition we have explored extensions to volumes. \nRobustness of these algorithms is essential for being able to process large collections of surface data automatically.  Quality is determined by how close the map from the surface to the plane preserves distances on the surface.   \nThe main outcomes of the project include the following. \n1. Robust feature-aligned parametrization and a global parametrization benchmark.\nSome of the most common approaches to global parametrization  use guiding fields of directions on surface,  aligned with natural directions ( for example surface curvature directions or sharp geometric features).  Existing techniques suffer from a number of problems, in particular,  lack of robustness (algorithms can fail  to produce a solution on valid input data).  We have designed a new robust approach to parameterization that is guaranteed, up to certain moderate precision limitations, to produce valid global parametrizations, in almost all cases respecting the structure of the guiding field. \nAs a part of the project we have designed the first benchmark for field-guided parametrization, used in many subsequent papers.\n2. 2D and 3D simply connected domain parameterization and mapping with guarantees\nWe have designed a first efficient method for computing mappings between arbitrary simply connected 2D domains (commonly used techniques of this type require convexity of one of the domains). \n Building on this  work, we found the first (to the best of our knowledge) algorithm that guarantees construction of a discrete bijective mapping  between 3d domains  homeomorphic to a sphere, for a broad class of tetrahedral meshes, so called \"shellable\" meshes.  The basic idea of the algorithm is remarkably simple and easy to implement, although it may lead to significant refinement. \n3. Quality of parametrization\n We have introduced a new approach to  parametrization (and more generally any geometric) distortion optimization; unlike  previously used approaches it is not based on energy, rather it uses the concept of strict minimizers, well-known in various forms in other domains, e.g., game theory, but so far not used in geometric applications.  A strict minimizer in particular minimizes worst-quality distortion, followed by \"second-worst\" etc. We found it useful in the context of distortion measures used for shape interpolation, deformation, parametrization and other applications involving geometric mappings. \n4. Seamless similarity maps for parametrization and quadrangulation \nFor feature-aligned parametrization, we have introduced a new concept of seamless similarity parametrizations. Compared to commonly used notions of global parametrization, these impose fewer restrictions on the mapping, but can match structure (in particular singularities) of any guiding field,  with a relatively straightforward construction.  At the same time, any such parametrization permits a construction of a special type of T-spline surfaces, enabling fully automatic, controllable construction of high-order surface approximations based on standard splines. \n5. Other outcomes  \nWe developed a novel method to generate quad meshes for non-rigid objects. Our method  takes into account the geometry of a collection of key poses in one-to-one correspondence or even an entire animation sequence. In  contrast to previous approaches which target static geometry, our method aims to optimize  the mesh's adaptation to the shape for every pose expected during animation or deformation  rather than for one specific reference state.\n We have developed a new scale-invariant definition of feature regions for parametrization alignment,  based on coherence and homogeneity properties, that can be  used to control parametrization. The detection of such regions is controlled a single scale-invariant parameter. \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Denis Zorin"
