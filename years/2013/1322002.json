 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining the Duration of the Ediacaran Shuram C-isotope Excursion using Rock Magnetic Cyclostratigraphy\r\n\r\nPI: Kenneth P. Kodama, Lehigh University, EAR-1322002\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThis award is designated as an OIIA/ISE Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded by NSF's OIIA International Science and Engineering Section.  This project will develop high-resolution time sequences, or chronostratigraphies, for the sedimentary rocks that carry a record of the Ediacaran (~555 Ma) Shuram negative carbon isotope excursion at two distant localities, one in South China and the other in South Australia. The chronostratigraphies will be determined by a new technique, rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy, which can detect global climate cycles that are driven by variations in the magnitude and direction of Earth's axial tilt and the ellipticity of Earth's orbit around the Sun. The astronomically-forced global climate cycles have been very regular throughout Earth history, so they provide a high-resolution metronome to develop time sequences for sedimentary rocks. The rock magnetic chronostratigraphies should provide up to 15,000 year resolution for the duration of the Shuram carbon isotope excursion recorded by the Doushantuo Formation in South China and by the Wonoka Formation in South Australia, both marine, silt-carbonate sedimentary rocks. Magnetizations applied in the laboratory to samples collected at close stratigraphic spacing (10-30 cm) will measure variations in the concentration of depositional magnetic minerals in the rocks. PIs previous work shows that the magnetic mineral concentration variations can record astronomically-forced global climate cycles. Oriented samples will also be collected from the Wonoka and Doushantuo rocks for standard paleomagnetic analysis to detect polarity reversals of the Earth's magnetic field. The reversal stratigraphy developed will help constrain the duration of the rock magnetically detected cycles to ensure they are astronomically-forced climate cycles. Comparing the rock magnetic cyclostratigraphies from two widely separated localities will provide a strong test of the primary nature of the Shuram carbon isotope excursion. Post-depositional alteration of the rocks is one explanation for the Shuram excursion. Identical high-resolution durations for the excursion in Australia and China would support a primary origin and would bolster the interpretation that the Shuram excursion is a singular event in Earth history and resulted from the oxidation of the world ocean just before life exploded into multi-cellular diversity.  The development of the rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy technique for Ediacaran rocks that will result from this project will afford higher resolution relative time assignment for these ancient rocks than afforded by current geochronological techniques.",

The excursion is a drop of the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 isotopes in carbonate rocks at about 550 Ma, just 10 Ma before the explosion of multi-cellular life on the planet, called the Cambrian explosion. Some workers suggest it records the oxidation of the world ocean and could be a contributing factor to the Cambrian explosion. Other workers suggest it is merely due to a secondary alteration of the rocks. It is found globally in Death Valley, CA, south Australia, south China, Oman, northwestern Canada, Mexico, and Namibia. With the funding from this grant, we were able to collect samples of rocks carrying the Shuram excursion in Australia, China, and Nevada. We had already sampled rocks in Death Valley, CA. We used and developed a new rock magnetics technique called rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy to determine the duration of the excursion in China and Australia, by collecting un-oriented samples at a close spacing stratigraphically (40 cm for 600 m in Australia and 10 cm for 50 m in China) and measuring the magnetic susceptibility of the samples. Magnetic susceptibility variations are caused by variations in the concentration of the magnetic minerals in the rocks. From the magnetic susceptibility measurements, we constructed a time series and analyzed it with spectral analysis to identify repeating cycles in it. We were able to identify these cycles as caused by ancient global climate cycles that have known periods of 400 ka, 100 ka, 30-40 ka, and 20 ka, the so-called Milankovitch cycles. Once we identified these cycles, we could count the number of cycles in a stratigraphic section to determine the duration. This indicated that the duration of the excursion in Australia and China was nearly identical, 8-9 Ma, much shorter than previous estimates and strong evidence that the excursion is a primary depositional event and probably caused by the oxidation of the world ocean. We also measured the paleomagnetism of oriented samples we collected in Australia, China and Nevada, and determined the magnetostratigraphy, the polarity reversals of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, of the rocks. Polarity reversals of the Earth&rsquo;s field occur over a short time interval, thousands of years, globally and can therefore be time markers in the rocks. We found in Death Valley and South Australia that a polarity transition from reversed to normal polarity occurs at the nadir of the carbon isotope excursion. This relationship strongly suggests that this event occurred globally at the same time, thus lending additional support for a primary depositional origin of the Shuram excursion. We have also sampled rocks in Nevada to investigate the relationship between their magnetostratigraphy and the carbon isotope profile because the rocks in China did not carry an ancient paleomagnetic signal. Our work has demonstrated the ability of rock magnetics to record ancient global climate change in ancient sedimentary rocks, which can be a powerful way to tie high resolution time to sedimentary sequences. It has shown that the Shuram carbon isotope excursion is the same length, 8-9 Ma, at globally separated localities and occurs synchronously globally. These two pieces of evidence suggest the Shuram excursion is a primary depositional feature and is likely to have recorded the oxidation of the world ocean at about 550 Ma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/03/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kodama</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
