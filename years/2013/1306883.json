 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variable world: Integrating population-level variation and climatic variation to predict climate change impacts\r\n\r\nThis project examines how differences in thermal physiology and climatic variation affect predictions about impacts of climate change on population and species viability in temperate and tropical regions. Using dung beetles, variation in thermal physiology will be quantified among and within species across broad latitudinal and elevational gradients. These detailed physiological data will be incorporated into a model that alters the magnitude and time course of climatic variation, allowing for an assessment of how physiological variation and climatic variation affect predictions about the impacts of climate change. The model will be applied to assessing population viability in other systems where the temperature dependence of population growth rate is known or can be calculated from principles in biological scaling.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include becoming fluent in developing and applying mathematical models to ecological studies. By combining detailed physiological data with climatic variation, the mathematical model developed during the fellowship will provide a more realistic assessment of climate change impacts across latitude. The project will add specimens to beetle collections in the USA and abroad, providing a locality-based record that can be used for teaching and research. Working internationally will allow interaction and collaboration with foreign students and colleagues, offering unique opportunities for teaching, training and learning for all parties involved. Results will be disseminated through scientific publications, presentations, and outreach and help guide national and international conservation efforts by providing an understanding of which species may be most at risk in a warming world. The third year teaching option will support the development of effective teaching in undergraduate classrooms by incorporating and assessing active learning techniques.",

A major goal of this project was to understand how differences in thermal physiology and climatic variation affect predictions about impacts of temperature variation on species across latitude. To accomplish this goal, the postdoctoral fellow compared how temperature extremes and increased temperature variation affect species in tropical and temperate environments. Specifically, detailed data on physiological traits (i.e. thermal performance curves and critical thermal limits of insects and degree days of corn) for species across latitude were combined with high-resolution temperature data from around the world to assess how shifts in temperature variation versus shifts in mean temperature affect organisms. Results indicated that using mean temperatures to make predictions does a poor job of capturing cryptic, or hidden, changes in temperature that can greatly impact species and ecological communities. This suggests that incorporating both detailed physiological data and high frequency temperature data provide better predictions of how species may respond to temperature change.
