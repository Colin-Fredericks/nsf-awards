 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1336794\r\nOverview:\r\nThe PIs seek to develop methodology to quantify, fingerprint, and distinguish natural and engineered\r\ncarbonaceous nanoparticles using thermal separation techniques and metal content signatures.\r\nBuilding on well-established thermal methods to quantify black carbon (BC) soot, the PIs\r\npropose a technique that distinguishes non-nanoparticulate natural organic matter, single-walled\r\ncarbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and BC (the most ubiquitous, natural carbonaceous nanoparticle)\r\nbased on their distinct thermal stabilities. Preliminary results suggest that natural organic\r\nmatter, SWCNTs, and BC have unique oxidation ranges and could be distinguished and quantified\r\nfollowing sequential oxidations coupled with elemental analysis. Here, we aim to demonstrate\r\nthat these thermal stabilities are preserved in complex mixtures of air, water, sediments,\r\nand soil, and as a result, can be used to quantitatively delineate the nanoparticles (e.g.,\r\nnatural vs. engineering) in environmental matrices. Furthermore, bulk metal contents determined\r\nvia complete acid digestion and mass spectrometry should provide a route toward source apportionment.\r\nAdvantages of this approach include the low cost, accessibility, high-throughput capabilities,\r\nand minimal sample processing (e.g., extraction) required for this method, which reduces the\r\npotential for analyte loss and transformation during analysis.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe National Research Council 2012 EHS Nanotechnology Research Strategy report listed analytical\r\ntechniques as the first research priority. Current approaches for measuring carbonaceous\r\nnanoparticles (CNPs) in the work place (and atmosphere) primarily rely on light-scattering\r\nparticle sizers, which provide a bulk measure of nano-sized particles. However, as synthetic\r\napproaches to form engineered carbonaceous nanoparticles (i.e, carbon nanotubes and graphene)\r\nare known to co-produce natural nanoparticles (i.e., soot), current results are reporting\r\nnatural plus engineered nanoparticle exposure. Thus, it is not possible to quantitatively\r\ndetermine occupational exposure to engineered nanoparticles. In addition, there are no methods\r\nto assess release of engineered nanoparticles to the atmosphere, which is a likely vector\r\nfor CNP transport to the environment. This has severe consequences for ongoing nanoparticle\r\nresearch: (1) fate models lack validated source data, (2) occupational exposure can be neither\r\nassessed nor enforced, and (3) environmental release can not be mitigated where necessary.\r\nUpon project completion, quantitatively differentiation of natural and engineered carbonaceous\r\nnanoparticles (NPs) will be possible for the first time, allowing accurate assessment of exposure\r\nto engineered NPs, which have unique properties, morphologies, and toxicities compared to\r\nnatural NPs. These goals are within the team?s reach and rely on affordable, accessible technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe PIs and their research groups are actively involved in the outreach efforts hosted by\r\nthe Center for the Environmental Implications of Nano-technology (CEINT) at Duke University,\r\nas well as other science enrichment activities there, including Females Excelling More in\r\nMath Engineering and Science (FEMMES) (100% females from underrepresented groups) volunteer\r\nscience workshops. As part of the proposed work, the PIs will establish a nano-analytical\r\nK-12 education module (Is CSI for real? Rapid Nano-forensics?), and this will be taught as\r\npart of NanoDays, FEMMES, and later distributed to the CEINT network of K-12 educators. Additionally,\r\nthe program will be modified for a more advanced audience (e.g., public library and senior\r\ncenter), delivered live, and videotaped for web distribution.",
