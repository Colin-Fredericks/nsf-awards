 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Elementary Teachers Engaged in Authentic Math and Science (ETEAMS) project provides a new, innovative professional development pathway for elementary preservice teachers to also seek certification to teach science or mathematics at the middle school level.  The project is a collaborative effort, with Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and the Corpus Christi Independent School District working together as partners to engage new teachers in field research focusing on the unique coastal environments of the region.  Participants in the program contribute to research teams based at the University that are studying and modeling ecological phenomena of the Gulf Coast along southern Texas, including variation in seagrass composition, the depositional history of tidal flat regions, variation among beach clams, and flatworm behavior.  In addition to gaining greater knowledge in science, technology, and mathematics, participants gain first-hand experiences with practices associated with contemporary field research and the use of  information technologies to consolidate and analyze data.  Participants also work alongside scientists to synthesize research results, and they work with practicing teachers of the participating school district to enrich the school curriculum with their findings from the research experiences.  The effectiveness of the project in increasing self-efficacy in science and mathematics, enhancing teaching efficacy, increasing understanding of the nature of science, and promoting effective teaching behaviors are being studied using a longitudinal matched group research design that enables the project team to compare participant outcomes with those of teachers and students at schools with similar educational and demographic profiles.\r\n\r\nThe field research experience is a key feature of a new professional development pathway that prepares preservice elementary teachers for certification as science or mathematics teachers at the middle school level.  The focus on marine biology provides opportunity to increase the science content knowledge of pre-service teachers in all the basic sciences, as well as in the integration of STEM areas of study.  The enhanced teacher preparation program also includes special workshops to increase content knowledge in STEM fields, and regular planning sessions with master teachers to work on lessons, learning activities, and curricular units that are informed by the field research experiences.  As new national and state curriculum standards for STEM fields place increasing emphasis on synthesizing practices and content across STEM fields, this innovative approach to the professional development of elementary and middle school teachers examines new ways of engaging new teachers in direct experiences with those practices and crosscutting ideas.",

This preparation program had three key components: a) authentic summer research experiences; b) collaborative planning and teaching of integrated STEM lessons; and c) targeted certification workshops focused on both STEM content and pedagogical content knowledge acquisition. &nbsp;During the summers of 2013-2016, pre-service teachers worked alongside Texas A &amp; M University- Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) STEM faculty and graduate students as they conducted both field and laboratory research on campus. This experience allowed the participants to understand what scientists do and to bring those processes and practices into their classrooms. Science Education faculty members supported the pre-service teachers in developing lessons for 3-8 students based on their summer experiences. During the school year, the education students met with project faculty to collaboratively develop and teach hands-on minds on STEM lessons at three partner schools (two elementary and one middle school) located in Corpus Christi ISD. &nbsp;This co-teaching model included a cycle of implementation, reflection, and modification of lessons throughout the granting period. A total of 119 distinct lessons were created; the lessons as well as all the supportive materials can be accessed through the project website at: <a href=\"http://eteamscc.com/c/school-program/stem-thursdays/\">http://eteamscc.com/c/school-program/stem-thursdays/</a>. &nbsp;A total of 27 Teacher Leaders (in-service teachers) at the partner schools joined the pre-service teachers in half day common planning of STEM lessons. These in-services teachers also participated in summer authentic research, attended and presented at conferences, as well as helped to develop the STEM Thursday lessons.</p>\n<p>ETEAMS improved the quantity, quality and diversity of middle levels mathematics and science teachers in high needs schools in the Coastal Bend Region through a collaboration between TAMUCC and Corpus Christi Independent School District. TAMUCC is a designated Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) located on the Gulf Coast of South Texas. 32 out of 63 (51%) of the graduated ETEAMS students came from traditionally underrepresented populations. Over the course of the grant period, 62 out of 63 (98%) of the undergraduate students in the program graduated and received their Bachelor&rsquo;s degree. These students began as Elementary Education (PreK-6) majors. 94% of the students who received their degrees during the grant period are currently teaching in K-12 classrooms. Forty of these teachers are teaching math and/or science in grades 3-8; 27 of these participants are in departmentalized classrooms while 13 of them are placed in self-contained elementary classrooms. Nine of the ETEAMS graduates were hired at one of the three partner schools after graduation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The leadership of the ETEAMS grant recognized that retention of quality teachers is a pressing problem facing K-12 education. They therefore developed an induction program for novice teachers. These teachers met monthly for continued professional development and to strengthen professional relationships. Many of these novice teachers were quickly identified within their schools as leaders. They coordinated school based science fair initiatives, organized a Community Science day, took on the role of grade level chair, all within their first three years teaching. &nbsp;Thirteen of the novice teachers pursued or are currently pursuing &nbsp;a Master&rsquo;s degree; five of them specifically chose to work towards a Masters in Curriculum and Instruction with a focus on Science and/or Math Education.

School administrators at the partner schools credit the ETEAMS program as a primary cause for increases in science &amp; mathematics scores. Specifically, in Grade 5 annual rates of students achieving &ldquo;proficient&rdquo; status in math in statewide high-stakes testing increased 32% during 2013-16 (43%, 59%, 67%, 75%) while science rates increased 24% (42%, 58%, 63%, 66%). <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to housing the STEM Thursday lessons, the eteamscc.com website contains numerous professional development activities, the electronic research logs that the participants created at the end of their summer authentic experiences, as well as the materials used to prepare students for the math certification exam.

In total, eighteen STEM faculty members, ten graduate students, and six undergraduate STEM students participated in ETEAMS through the Summer Authentic Research and STEM Thursday activities in the schools. These collaborators also volunteered in the schools as science fair judges and as guest speakers during career and science days.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
