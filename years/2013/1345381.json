 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal was submitted as an EAGER grant; it seeks funding for a US-Turkey Collaborative research initiative. The application was entitled, ? Multi-scale material and dynamic thermo-fluid computational models and controls for sustainable buildings using efficient energy harvesting materials,? submitted by Ulrike Passe from Iowa State University.  This one-year grant proposes a comprehensive numerical, analytical, and experimental investigation of the domed Harran houses located in Turkey, with the goal of improving fundamental understanding of how these domed structures lead to improved comfort conditions through passive means. Experimental measurements will be carried out in Turkey on some of these homes, and these data will be used to help develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Reduced-order models will be developed in order to implement a proactive control system, and phase-change materials (PCMs) will be incorporated into the building. \r\n\r\nThis US-Turkey collaborative effort could potentially have a transformative impact on building design in hot arid climates of the Middle East and southwestern US, thus contributing transformative knowledge to engineering of sustainable high performance buildings through dynamic BIM. The PIs also propose an array of outreach activities, including undergraduate students, community college students, and high school students.",
