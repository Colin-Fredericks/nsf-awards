 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the Southeast United States.  Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles arise, in situ, from atmospheric reactions of BVOCs  together with the subsequent partitioning of these products into condensed phase materials. The direct measurement of sensitivities of SOA production rates and properties to various environmentally relevant perturbations in the ambient conditions at the SOAS study site will provide a convenient test point for the description of the chemical mechanisms of SOA formation, needed for use in a variety of climate and air quality models.  \r\n\r\nThe project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, research staff and faculty, creating an environment for student development and exposure to interdisciplinary research and collaboration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to measure the properties and concentration of aerosol particles at a rural site in Alabama as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS).  The SOAS campaign was part of a multi-agency effort to better understand what controls the concentrations of trace gases and various types of aerosol particles in the region.  Our research team studied how aerosol particles change as they interact with atmospheric moisture through swelling caused by water uptake when the relative humidity is less than 100% and as some of them form cloud droplets when the relative humidity is greater than 100%.  The particles we measured are less than 1 micrometer (one millionth of a meter) in diameter and are composed mainly of mixtures of compounds that form in the atmosphere following reactions involving gases emitted from regional pollution sources and from the surrounding forest.  We also used a pair of Teflon chambers to study how atmospheric particles grow and their properties change as they interact with the complex mixture of oxidizing and condensing gases present in the air.  We collected data throughout the one a half month long SOAS study and then spent the remainder of the project period analyzing the data and collaborating with other researchers who made complementary measurements. \n\nOur measurements of water uptake of the atmospheric particles have been combined with measurements of their composition and their phase state (solid or liquid) that were made by other groups during the same study.  The results of that analysis showing a strong connection between the various properties have been published in a journal article.  All of our data were submitted to a project archive so that they can be used for additional analyses as researchers work to integrate even larger sets of measurements to test and improve atmospheric models that are used to connect current and future emissions to the resulting impact on air quality and climate.\n\nThis project supported two Texas A&amp;M University graduate students and three undergraduates.  The two graduate students, a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) student from Puerto Rico, and a new assistant professor from University of North Alabama participated in the field work.  They all benefited from the opportunity to work together with dozens of leading researchers from universities and agencies from around the U.S. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald R Collins"
