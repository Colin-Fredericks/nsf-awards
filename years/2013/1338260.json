 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support in the form of travel awards for U.S.-based graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the 14th IEEE MDM 2013 Conference, which will be held in Milan, Italy, June 3-6, 2013. The MDM series of conferences, annually organized by the IEEE society since 1999, has established itself as a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results in mobile data management. The conference provides unique opportunities for researchers, engineers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore new ideas, techniques, and tools, and to exchange experiences in mobile data management. Attendees will participate interactions via lively presentations of accepted technical papers, posters and demos, and invited talks given by leading academics and industry professionals of related fields. The participation of US based graduate and promising undergraduate students will result in the intellectual simulation of young minds to pursue advanced research and development activities in this area that has huge technical and societal impact, and helps U.S. keep the leading position in this vital field. To ensure a broader impact in disseminating the results of the conference, and to garner interest among young researchers in the fields of mobile data management, this award is for travel grants enabling student travel to attend IEEE MDM 2013 and the workshops to be held in conjunction with the MDM 2013. The purpose is to encourage the attendance of students who otherwise would not have the opportunity to participate in such a conference.\r\n\r\nThe allocation of the grants will be based on need and impact of the applicant?s attendance in increasing the diversity of conference participation.  Minority students, students from underrepresented institutions, and students in financial need will be given higher priority.",
