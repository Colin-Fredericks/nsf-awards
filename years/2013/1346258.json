 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Early concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will develop a new and potentially powerful approach to determining the extent and rate of internal decay in living trees, without having to cut them down. Two portable versions of equipment similar to CAT scanners will be used to create images of stem cross-sections. These images will be used to estimate the total amount of carbon lost to decay over the lifetime of the tree. The project will focus on the three principal northern hardwood species: sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech. \r\n\r\nThis project will involve the collaboration of two forest pathologists who have complementary backgrounds and expertise in forestry, forest ecology and mycology. Two student interns from the Stockbridge School of Agriculture Internship program will be trained. The lead scientists have  responsibilities for public outreach and will extend results to forest ecologists, arborists and urban foresters. Data will contribute to the development of forest management strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. Results will also be used in displays and presentations at local science museums, schools and public events.",
