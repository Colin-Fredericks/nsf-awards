 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will bring together a broad spectrum of the geoscience education community to undertake an in-depth review of undergraduate geoscience education. The objective will be to begin the process that would develop a vision and road map for the community on undergraduate geosciences education for the 21st century. In a 2.5 day workshop, participants will bring to the surface key issues that the community needs to work on in order to set a vision that is audacious, well-informed, and implementable. Over the last 17 years since the last community wide effort, significant advances in the geosciences, in technology, and in STEM education have occurred.  Questions that need to be addressed include: How can we best prepare our undergraduate students for graduate school and/or future careers in the geosciences? What should an undergraduate geoscience curriculum cover? What are best practices for student learning and use of technology in the geosciences? What can we do to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities and increase the number of qualified K-12 geoscience teachers?\r\n\r\nThis summit will catalyze new approaches, techniques, and uses of technology to enhance student learning by bringing together participants with very different expertise and backgrounds. The ultimate outcome of the activities initiated by the summit conversations will be students from diverse backgrounds better prepared to address fundamental geoscience questions using modern technology, tools and techniques.  Geoscientists play a critically important role in addressing societal issues such as energy, water, natural hazards (e.g. earthquakes, volcanos, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods), mineral resources, climate, environment, and sustainability. It is expected that the post-summit activities will have a profound impact on the education of future geoscientists, increasing the quality and breadth of their education and preparation for future careers. An increase in their understanding of natural processes will help find solutions to society's problems.",
