 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous aquatic insect species inhabiting rivers feed on leaves shed from trees in the surrounding forest.  Experiments using alder trees showed that these stream organisms can adapt to feed optimally on individual alder trees growing along their specific river banks; i.e., they feed on locally derived alder leaves faster than on leaves from alder trees growing alongside different rivers.  Further studies suggest that aquatic organisms adapt to individual alder trees based on differences in the chemical composition of the leaves.  Terrestrial insects feeding on leaves often induces plants to produce chemical deterrents to defend against further feeding, which suggests the hypothesis that variation in the chemical defense system among individual trees influences feeding rate by aquatic organisms.  This project will test that hypothesis through chemical analyses to determine the leaf traits causing local adaptation, and by experimentally unraveling the roles of aquatic microbes and insects in driving this adaptation.  This research will increase our understanding of the role of biodiversity at the individual level in shaping ecosystem function, illustrate how the ecological interactions in one ecosystem can indirectly shape the structure of other ecosystems through fluxes across boundaries, and illuminate the mechanisms of resilience in river ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis research informs two economic pillars of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, forestry and fisheries, by advancing our understanding of how variation among trees may affect rivers that sustain the region's fisheries.  Results from this project will be disseminated to local forest and fisheries managers, including the Elwha and Makah Native American tribes, as well as to the general public.  Understanding the ecological effects of individual variation is essential to efforts to predict how genetic diversity, which is rapidly declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation, can alter the functioning of ecosystems.  This project will provide research experiences for undergraduates and supports the dissertation research of a doctoral student.",

Preserving species diversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem health. Extinction of a single species can have a domino effect of extinctions causing entire ecosystem collapse, and ultimately cause humans to lose resources required for our survival. While the field of community ecology has traditionally viewed within-species variation as noise in a dataset to be controlled with replication, experimental design and statistics, emerging evidence suggests diversity within species is also an essential component of ecosystem health and can result in broad ecosystem changes. We study forests and streams as a model system that integrates two economic pillars of the Pacific Northwest &ndash; forestry and fisheries.\n\nTrees in these forests naturally drop their leaves into streams, providing a vital energy source for aquatic microbial and invertebrate communities, which in turn is the energy source for fish.  We discovered that these aquatic consumers are locally adapted to the leaf resources entering streams from adjacent forests.  These consumers more rapidly decompose leaves from not only local versus non-local species of trees, but also from the specific individual trees within a single species, often discerning among trees only a few hundred meters apart.  We found that this adaptation pattern can largely be explained by how plants defend themselves.  Terrestrial insects can trigger a chemical defense response in trees by feeding on their leaves. The chemicals released as a result of this defense response alter the chemical composition of leaves, and these defense compounds have long-lasting effects that result in suppressed feeding among aquatic consumers. \n\nBy studying plant defense compounds using newer techniques in mass spectrometry, we found that geographically neighboring trees share similar chemistry.  Further, this chemistry variation among individual trees was by itself sufficient to drive the same local adaptation patterns in streams that we first documented with intact leaves.
