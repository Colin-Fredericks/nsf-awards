It provides infrastructure to support advanced research in program protection and exploitation and provides the necessary tools to support new opportunities for education including an undergraduate Cyber Assurance curriculum and hands-on learning support for K-12 STEM outreach.

Through the CRI, four lab facilities in the state-of-the-art Shelby Hall building on the USA campus have been outfitted with over 40 research-class workstations, equipment for live malware experiments, specialized hardware for reprogrammable hardware synthesis, instrumentation for cybersecurity data collection, software for a wide range of program analysis and security evaluation, and a fully developed testbed for training in cyber defense competitions and capture the flag events.</p>\n<p>In terms of curriculum, the infrastructure has provided support for over 140 students in ten offerings of seven courses with cybersecurity and computer science focus.&nbsp; It has enabled 30 student course projects in secure software engineering, new special topics courses that teach students how to protect software from malicious attack, and provides support for directed studies and senior project teams focusing on software and hardware assurance. In terms of training, the infrastructure has provided equipment and resources to directly support a new DayZero Cyber Competition Club student group on the campus which has participated in 6 competitions including the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC), the CSAW Capture the Flag event, and the NSA Codebreaker challenge. The club trains over 15 members in software security, ethical hacking, and network defense on a regular basis and has conducted outreach events during the Cyber Security Awareness Month.

In addition, the CRI directly funded one Master's student graduate assistant and the lab facilities and instrumentation provided computing resources for 15 other Master's and Doctoral students. The infrastructure has directly contributed to completion of 5 Master's theses and currently supports ongoing progress of 1 Undergraduate honor's thesis, 11 Master's theses, and 4 Doctoral dissertations.
