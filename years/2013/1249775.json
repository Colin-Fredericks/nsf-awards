 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Amanda Thomas has been granted an NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at Stanford University.  Her research efforts will primarily focus on better constraining source properties of recently discovered low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) in Parkfield, CA.  LFEs are the seismic manifestation of deep fault slip and are typically depleted in high-frequency energy relative to shallow earthquakes.  The goals of this project are to determine focal mechanism solutions for each low-frequency earthquake family, to isolate LFE source spectra and quantify spectral parameters such as corner frequency, and to explore the spatial variability of spectral morphology of both regular and low-frequency earthquakes in Parkfield.  \r\n\r\nEarthquake forecasts and ground motion predictions estimate the probability of a large earthquake, the intensity of shaking, and its potential impact on a region of interest.  These tools rely heavily on parameters such as magnitude, recurrence interval, and rupture area.  While deep slip could potentially influence each of these, its effect is excluded from rupture forecasts because it is neither well characterized nor well understood.  Incorporating the results gleaned from studies of slow-slip phenomena into earthquake forecasts and ground motion simulations may improve such models.  The proposed education plan involves two components: directing a graduate seminar on seismic sources and teaching an entry level field course on geologic hazards in California.  The goal of the graduate seminar will be to develop a comprehensive understanding of the earthquake source through discussion of classic and recent literature in the field.  The undergraduate field course will expose students to earth science and promote awareness of geologic hazards, such as rock falls, earthquakes, and volcanoes.  Students will use simple data collection and analysis techniques coupled with collective discussion and interpretation to determine how the tectonic evolution of California gave rise to such threats and to quantify their potential impact.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStrain energy within the Earth is released on faults that can either rupture abruptly - causing hazardous earthquakes - or slip slowly in largely aseismic events that can last hours to years.  These slow earthquakes are a recently discovered phenomenon and occur regularly on faults throughout the world. Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are small (approximately M1-2) repeating earthquakes that occur in association with deep, slow earthquakes.  Like typical earthquakes LFEs are thought to represent shear slip on crustal faults but when compared to shallow earthquakes of the same magnitude LFEs are depleted in high-frequency content and occur on the deep roots of faults where ductile deformation, as opposed to brittle failure, should be the preferred deformation mechanism.  The research supported by this award was designed to determine which physical proceeses are responsible for the differences between LFEs and traditional earthquakes.  The results of our analysis show that LFEs have a slip speed that is far smaller than that of shallow earthquakes.  The suppressed slip speed can explain fundamental differences in frequency content between LFEs and traditional earthquakes and also shows that differences in rheology are not required to produce both aseismic and seismic slip during slow slip events.  Additional work on the LFE source shows that LFEs also are not self similar earthquakes, meaning that the displacement to length ratio is not constant, as in traditional earthquakes, and depends on LFE magnitude.  Observations such as these can be used to constrain the rheology of the deep crust which is critical for developing accurate ground motion predictions for large earthquakes, such as the impending M9 Cascadia subduction zone event.\n\nThis award also included the training of two undergraduate interns interested in pursuing graduate studies in geophysics.  One intern developed an apparatus consisting of a spring-block system to demonstrate stick-slip behavior thought to be responsible for crustal earthquakes.  A second intern conducted a summer research project on seismicity at geothermal and injection sites around the USA.  This award also supported the development of a course for incoming college students to learn about geology, earthquakes, and volcanic hazards in the Pacific Northwest.  The course included weekly meetings to talk about how volcanoes work, a field trip to the Oregon Cacades to observe two active volcanoes, and debunking the portrayal of volcanoes in popular science fiction movies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amanda M Thomas"
