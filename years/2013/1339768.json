 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on creating and upgrading software infrastructure for a large community of scientists engaged in volcanology research and associated hazard analysis.  Specifically, the project will reengineer three widely used tools (TITAN2D - block and ash flows, TEPHRA and Puff - ash transport and dispersal) and develop support for workflows that use these tools to analyze risk from volcanic hazards. Reengineering will encompass modularization so researchers may easily experiment with different modeling approaches, incorporation of techniques to make the tools efficient on new computing architectures like GPUs and many-core chips. The workflows are intended to tackle the challenges of managing complex and often large data flows associated with these tools in validation processes and in probabilistic inference based on the outcomes of the modeling. The tools and workflows will be made available using the popular vhub.org platform. This project will help provide a standard well managed hardware/software platform and approaches to standardize the documentation associated with input data, source code, and output data. This will ensure that model calculations are reproducible.\r\n\r\nThe wider use of these high fidelity tools and their use in mitigating hazards is likely to have a significant effect on hazard analysis and management. The project will also engage in several major workshops and in training activities. Project personnel will also engage in the Earthcube initiative - popularizing computational methodologies, online access and dissemination mechanisms through the VHub platform.",

This project resulted in the development of new computer codes to simulate the potential impacts of volcanic eruptions. The purpose of these codes is to better understand specific hazards associated with volcanic eruptions to mitigate the risk to those that live nearby. The codes model the dispersion of volcanic ash, the frequency of volcanic eruptions, and the potential impacts of lava flows. The science behind these codes is improved as a result of the project in two important ways. First, the codes do a better job of simulating natural phenomena than has previously been possible.

As a result, we can glean much more information from the geologic record of past eruptions to learn more about what future volcanic activity might be like. Second, the codes are modular and faster than any previous codes developed to simulate these phenomena. That means that users can simulate a greater range of potential outcomes of volcanic activity. The codes are already in use to evaluate threats to nuclear power plants and communities near active volcanoes. Some specific examples of how the codes have been used already include: (1) forecasting the frequency of volcanic ash impacts over northern Europe, which can potentially result in billions of sdollars of economic loss, (2) forecasting lava flow inundation from flank eruptions on Mt. Fuji (Japan), (3) testing the vulnerability of a nuclear power plant site in Idaho to potential volcanic activity. Because the codes are modular in design, volcano scientists will be able to test new methods of describing volcanic activity without having to rewrite the entire code.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/23/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;B&nbsp;Connor</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339768/1339768_10280612_1521840747584_fuji-p2s--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339768/1339768_10280612_1521840747584_fuji-p2s--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simulation of Lava Flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339768/1339768_10280612_1521840747584_fuji-p2s--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simulation of Lava Flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of a lava flow simulated with the Modular Lava Flow Simulator for the Earth Sciences (MOLASSES) developed for this project.
