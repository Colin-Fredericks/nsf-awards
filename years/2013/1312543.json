 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project synthesizes theory, computation and experiments to create multiscale models of dense particulate flows, ranging from microstructural dynamics of nearly contacting particles to the macrorheological properties of dense suspensions. The theoretical core of the project includes both mechanistic models of nearly contacting groups of particles, and continuum modeling and analysis of the dynamics of dense suspensions. The research develops new Stokesian Dynamics algorithms to resolve the slow particle interactions in dense suspensions, and uses simulations of how particles collectively reconfigure on the micro-scale to accommodate applied external strains to construct a continuum model for suspension rheology. New theory is supported by experiments carried out in the Applied Mathematics Laboratory at UCLA to test predictive models of suspension rheology.\r\n\r\nParticle laden flows are important in many industrial applications including oil and gas extraction, coal processing, mining of minerals, and waste-water treatment.  Results from this basic research project can be used to develop quantitative models for such diverse applications as spiral separators in the mining industry, cell separation in inertial microfluidic devices and aggregation of microbes. The project supports both graduate student research and undergraduate research involving experiments and theory.",

We developed a new theory and model for gravitationally driven flow with different particle types such as glass and ceramic beads, which are readily available for laboratory experiments.  The theory involved the study of a new system of partial differential equations for the different species and the background fluid carrying the slurry.  We performed analysis of these equations to show that shocks &ndash; in which the concentration of one of the species changes suddenly from one location to another &ndash; can explain the dynamics of the laboratory experiments.  This work has direct implications for developing a predictive theory for spiral separators used in the mining industry. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marcus Roper"
