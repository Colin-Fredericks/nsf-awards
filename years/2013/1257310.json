 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will survey the armored scale insects of tropical rainforest sites on four continents.  They will build a reference collection of specimens and their DNA.  Using both DNA sequences and anatomical features, they will discover and describe new species, investigate their evolutionary history, and produce an online interactive key.\r\n\tMany armored scale insects are invasive pests, costing an estimated $2 billion per year in the US.  Many of these pests can feed on an extraordinarily large diversity of plants, and are probably native to areas with high plant diversity such as tropical rainforests.  However, the armored scale insect fauna of tropical rainforests is unknown.  In a pilot study, the investigators found that several of these worldwide pest species are common in a Panama rainforest canopy.  These may be some of the most abundant herbivores on earth.  This project will investigate them for the first time in their probable ancestral habitat, and will likely discover other species that are not yet invasive pests but that are likely to become invasive pests in the future.  At the same time the investigators will develop tools that will enable inspectors to identify these pests if and when they show up in plant quarantine.",

They are probably the most invasive group of insects in the world, with about one new species becoming established in the US every year. What makes them so invasive is that almost every plant has armored scale insects on it, but they are small and hard to see so usually they go unnoticed. Another thing that allows some armored scale insects to be invasive pests is that they can eat an enormous diversity of different kinds of plants -- an ability called \"extreme polyphagy\". This contrasts with most commonly known insects that feed on plants (e.g. moths, butterflies, and beetles) that feed on only a handful of plant species. Why are they so invasive? Why are they so polyphagous? Although we know a lot about armored scale insect pests in human-altered habitats, we know very little about armored scale insects in natural environments, where the traits that predispose them to being agricultural pests originated. We hypothesized that extreme polyphagy evolved in environments with very high plant diversity, such as tropical rainforests, and that it is correlated with large population size. In this project we sought to test these hypotheses by travelling to tropical rainforest study plots in 4 different regions (Panama, Australia, Malaysia, and Gabon) and collecting armored scale insects from identified trees and shrubs representing more than 700 plant species. Our goals were to identify them to species using both traditional anatomical characters and DNA; to record what host plants each species used; to estimate their relative populations sizes; and to illustrate and describe any new species we discovered. With this information we aimed to test the connection between extreme polyphagy and population size; to develop tools for molecular identification of armored scale insects; and to distinguish between pests, potential pests, and non-pests. We obtained over 3900 infestations of armored scale insects, from which we have prepared more than 4000 specimens (a specimen preparation involves extracting DNA from a scale insect and mounting its cuticle on a microscope slide for study and identification). 1250 of these were prepared as part of the research experiences of five undergraduate students at the University of San Diego. We found more than 200 species of armored scale insects, of which more than half are new to science and have not yet been described. We do find that extremely polyphagous pest species are abundant in tropical rainforests, especially in Panama and Australia, but we also find evidence of more specialized species that resemble polyphagous pests, especially in Malaysia. We have published or submitted several scientific papers on aspects of this work but have not yet completed all of our specimen preparation, analyses, or species descriptions, and we estimate that these specimen collections will provide grist for several more years of productive research. In addition, this research had a significant educational component, as the students who worked on this project all gained first-hand experience with primary research and two students wrote honors theses based on independent projects that they developed and executed as part of this funding. Additionally, the methods developed in this research have been modified to serve as the basis of a research project course at the University of San Diego, where students gain first-hand experience integrating field, morphological, and molecular genetic research in a hypothesis-testing framework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/11/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Geoffrey&nbsp;E&nbsp;Morse</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
