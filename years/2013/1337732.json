The research to be enabled includes a wide and eclectic variety of problems with direct impact on health and social issues. Some directions include understanding the impact of climate change on gene expression and ecosystems, bringing genetic analysis into medical clinics, identifying effective antibiotics, and exploring socio-genomics relations between stress, depression, and genetics among low-income African-American mothers.  \r\nCompGen provides an environment that enables managing and processing genomic information and developing new algorithms. The instrument brings disruptive computing architectures and algorithmic techniques to facilitate analysis of genomic data while providing high accuracy results, resilience to errors, and scalability with growing volumes of data. It enables addressing the challenges of scale and diversity in genomic data through the development of new algorithms, models, and statistical methods. The instrument development focuses on reduction of data volume, optimization of storage hierarchy, identification and implementation of computational primitives, data visualization, mathematical toolkit optimization, and performance and reliability assessment. These developments are expected to lead to new computational structures and hardware/software architectures that can be incorporated into hierarchical databases as well as heterogeneous processors for data analysis, compression, and optimization.  \r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\nIn addition to serving many areas, CompGen will serve as a tool for educating students and professionals in efficient ways to process and analyze genomic data and for handling big data in general. The instrument will serve multidisciplinary classes in which students gain hands-on research experience and introductory classes that expose students to applications and tools. Existing outreach and education programs will be utilized to expose the instrument. Plans include Open House events attracting thousands of visitors, Coursera courses, and minority outreach workshops. A mentoring tool, Mytri, will be used for networking among female students. Moreover, the CompGen design will be made available to others by fundamentally changing the methods by which big datasets are handled in genomics research. To this effect, an R&D consortium of hospitals, companies, and universities has been established to help identify needs, provide sources of data, act as early adopters, and ensure that new technologies are transferred smoothly into widespread use.",

Dr. Richard Weinshilboum of Mayo perhaps best summarized the impact when he addressed the CCBGM (an NSF I/UCRC spawned from the initial MRI Industry Consortium) in November 2019: \"The NSF is playing a critical role as a catalyst in eliminating both the psychological and the real barriers between the computational science and wet lab biomedical science.\"\n\n \n\nLocal funding has been allocated to ensure that the vision of the initial proposal survives well beyond the end of the MRI grant.  Provided cooperatively by the Vice-Chancellor for Research, the Institute for Genomic Biology, the Coordinated Science Lab and the College of Engineering, these funds are used to support core staff in high-performance genomic computing, to host periodic meetings as a forum for discussing opportunities and sharing results, to fund a diverse group of more than 30 graduate student fellows supervised jointly by biology and computing faculty, and to seed new projects at the interface of the disciplines.  CompGen Fellows have gone on to positions with other faculties, IBM, Mayo, and so forth.

Our faculty involved have also developed educational materials ranging from genomics-focused data science and probability courses for senior undergraduates through graduate seminars focused on genomic technologies.\n\n \n\nSince the inception of the MRI, UIUC has been successful in obtaining numerous additional grants and collaborative efforts in related areas, including a BD2K Center, a software tools and methods grant, and an R25 education and training grant.  Internal and external collaborations have also deepened as a result of the MRI.   Within the University, meaningful benchmarks for the MRI machine arose through joint efforts with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), led by its Innovative Systems Lab and by the Blue Waters project.  CompGen also continues to hold regular joint workshops with the UIUC Cancer Center. \n\n \n\nOur close connections with industrial partners enabled us to go beyond our original plans in developing the instrument.  For example, as an upgrade, we were able to leverage our close collaboration with IBM to acquire their latest Power9 CPU based systems as well as their Spectrum-Scale based SSD storage equipment.  These systems further improve performance through support for the latest NVLink and OpenCAPI technologies.  Using the IBM CAPI along with Xilinx FPGA technology led to development of accelerators for several common computational kernels commonly used in computational genomics.\n\n \n\nThe collaborative industry relationship envisioned and initiated by the MRI has been realized in the new Center for Computational Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine (CCBGM), developed with Mayo Clinic and U. Chicago and supported by the NSF I/UCRC program and industry partners.  This new center seeks to advance pressing societal issues, such as enabling patient- specific treatment of cancer and other diseases, understanding and modifying microbial communities related to human health and agriculture, and supporting humanity\u2019s growing need for food by improving the efficiency of plant and animal agriculture.  CCBGM has also begun to contribute significantly to knowledge in a wide range of disciplines centered around computational problems in genomics and related fields. Our work with Mayo has continued to grow both within CCBGM and outside of it.\n\n \n\nIn addition to numerous theses, papers, web sites, and educational materials, the grant produced several designs and tools now available for general use.
