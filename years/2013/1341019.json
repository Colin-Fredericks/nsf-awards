 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, Houston-Cyberinfrastructure (HoustonCI), establishes a flow separation and analysis system for the University of Houston campus network while enabling high bandwidth data transfers from domain science laboratories on the University of Houston and Rice University campuses. These laboratories all connect to the regional networks LEARN (Lonestar Education and Research Network, Texas-wide network with over 30 institution members), SETG (SouthEast Texas Gigapop, Houston-based fiber loop with University of Houston, Rice University, Texas Medical Center, and other institutional members in Houston area), GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation), and Internet2 100 Gbps software-defined network (SDN). In this respect, the project has two objectives: (i) leverage software-defined networking  (SDN) to separate flows for better monitoring of where high data transfer needs and network issues are; and (ii) pave the way towards connecting with 100 Gbps cyber-infrastructure of Internet2. The research and development effort is in the creation of a troubleshooting framework that utilizes OpenFlow protocol flow definitions.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be on campus network engineers having a deeper exposure to network utilization by science data transfers. On one hand, such a troubleshooting capability will better the network design and planning processes on campuses. On the other hand, the domain scientists will be able to communicate science data transfer needs with network engineers. SDN will enable effective allocation of bandwidth with savings in campus networking investments by institutions. The research methods and results will be tested and demonstrated by utilizing the GENI infrastructure as an experimentation testbed.",
