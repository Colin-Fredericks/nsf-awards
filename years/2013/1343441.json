 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support undergraduate students attending and participating in the Laser Science XXIX Conference, October 6-11, 2013 in Orlando, FL.  Specifically, the students present their research in the \"Symposium on Undergraduate Research\" on Monday Oct 7, 2013.  Previous years' programs are at http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm. The intellectual merit of this project is that the undergraduate students present and disseminate the results of the research, many from NSF-supported REU programs.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact is to provide the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting of this stature and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions since very often students in different universities are involved in similar projects. A third impact is to initiate networking among these students that will be vital to their future careers as professional scientists, and to encourage them to continue along such a career path.",

The Symposium has grown from ten presentations in 2001 to forty-two this year on projects done at about 30 universities or research institutes in the US and Europe.
