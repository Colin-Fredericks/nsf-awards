 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an efficient bioprocess for domestic production of fatty acids from renewable biomass sugars.   The translated advanced bioprocess has the following unique features: it is heterotrophic fermentation based and not land based, which provides exemplary high yield, and high efficiency. Furthermore, it is weather independent, environmentally friendly and will enable a low cost supply of fatty acids when compared to the fatty acids production from palm and coconut plants.  The project accomplishes this goal by rapidly developing the microbial strain and bioprocess resulting in scale-up in the near future.  The partnership engages Technology Holding to provide guidance in the process development and other aspects including future financing, commercialization trajectory and market strategy as they pertain to the potential to translate the advanced bioprocess technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The technology has potential to have a significant impact on a $50 B consumer products market in the next 7-10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the consumer products industry. The societal impact, long term, will be reduced dependence on foreign countries, high-value jobs creation by creating a new domestic industry, access to cheaper products and environmental sustainability.",
