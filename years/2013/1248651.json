 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innovation of this research is to investigate and design new techniques and algorithms which show the feasibility of the concept of a universal file system in which data tagging and synchronization are built in.  The proposed file system is universal in the sense that it will allow for uniform tagging and synchronization of all files and information types across all operating systems and devices. Novel techniques towards a proof of concept prototype of a tagging system will be studied and implemented. In this system, tags can be universally associated across all digital information types and devices. The system will also instantaneously update and synchronize tags in between all devices as changes are being made.  The proposed system will consist of two components: first, client applications in which tags can be assigned manually or automatically and shared with collaborators; second, server software running in the cloud which enables synchronization of tags across different devices and users.  The universal tagging system will allow for new methods of collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is to efficiently organize and retrieve large amount of digital information distributed across multiple devices.   As the amount of digital information is exploding, methods of organizing digital information through the traditional use of file systems and folders have become unmanageable. Inspired by taxonomies used by digital librarians, consumers and enterprises are starting to use tags to organize their digital assets. This can be seen by the use of tags in email systems, photo software, or by the use of hash tags in text messages. However, each of those applications maintains its own tags and does not allow for the use of those tags outside of their own application. This problem is even more acute as it is common to store the same information across multiple devices, raising the issue of data synchronization across devices. The techniques and algorithms investigated in this research redefines the notion of a file system allowing universal tagging and synchronization across all file types and all devices, enabling better organization and transparent synchronization of data among various devices. The technologies will help consumers and enterprises to better access and share digital information as well as provide a new platform for collaboration.",
