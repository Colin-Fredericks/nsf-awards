 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to determine the degree to which the thermal and mechanical properties of nanoscale polymer fiber specimens can attain theoretical limits.  Polymer materials are used in millions of consumer products even though their mechanical properties are relatively poor and their thermal conductivity is low.  This is because long molecular chains tend to be disordered.  However, the intrinsic stiffness, strength and thermal conductivity of polymers are high due to their carbon-carbon backbone.  Using an ultra-high draw ratio technique, it now is possible to fabricate polyethylene nanofibers with a high degree of order.  The approach in this work will be to employ a micromachined stepper motor to test ultra-drawn polymer mechanical properties.  For the thermal conductivity measurements, a recently-developed six wire platform will be used.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this work is that it will enable assessment of polymer nanofiber for many applications.  It is possible that properties near theoretical limits will be attained because the ultra-drawn fibers are highly ordered.  Simultaneous high stiffness, strength and thermal conductivity values will in turn stimulate broad research.  This will be in manufacturing techniques such as large scale nanofiber production, and in applications such as heat sinks, heat exchangers, body armor and composites.  With regard to education, the investigators will expand two courses at Carnegie Mellon University.  One will focus on mechanics and test methods of nanoscale specimens.  The second will focus on thermal properties and develop metamaterial approaches to control them.  Students in the investigators undergraduate course will be introduced to micromachined devices through a lecture and a portable \"Class on a Chip\" system.  Grade 6-9 students will learn to program a micromachined device through an icon-driven interface.  A Ph.D. student and two Master's Thesis students will gain expertise in both mechanical and thermal measurement techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe continued development of materials to achieve ever higher  properties is  critical in meeting societal economic and performance needs.   Polymer chains provide infinite degrees of freedom in varying material properties.  One  important feature is that they can be aligned along the  covalently bonded carbon-carbon chain axis, and will then be highly crystalline.  As such, their strength and thermal conductivity will be  limited mainly by crystalline defects rather than by other common polymer defects such as entanglements and voids.  In this project a new method to draw ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) polymers to create nanofibers with high crystallinity and low defect levels was developed.   A specific strength (strength/density) 30 times that of  the strongest metals was achieved.  The PE nanofiber strength is 40% higher than the highest previous polymer values.  At the same time, thermal conductivity on par  with metals was also measured.  In comparison, bulk polymers have specific strength and  thermal conductivity about 200 times lower. These lightweight polymer nanofibers with  high thermal-mechanical functionality could find general applications in aerospace and automotive systems, where a high strength-to-weight ratio is very desirable. They can be used in civil engineering structures as a light weight and conformable reinforcement, in medical (particularly wearable and implantable) devices, as well as in robotics.
