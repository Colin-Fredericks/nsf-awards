Given the economic and social incentives to migrate towards renewable energy sources there has been tremendous interest in the technology. However, at present it is not yet apparent what the most efficient design would be for real ocean conditions. A second open issue pertains to environmental impact. Such devices are able to extract a significant fraction of energy from the water column and can produce local modifications to the bed stress resulting in a morphodynamic adjustment in locations where the substrate is mobile. When sited in an inlet or constriction, a turbine array can influence the exchanges of water between an embayment and the adjacent ocean. An accurate quantification of environmental impact is critical for site planning and permitting.\r\n\r\nPresently, researchers are examining scientific issues related to tidal kinetic energy extraction using a variety of computational tools that range from commercial CFD codes for evaluating device performance to ocean models for evaluating impact and site selection. Taken independently, such approaches are forced to rely on simplifying assumptions that decrease the accuracy and utility of the computations. The device scale CFD models typically employ a uniform inflow velocity, ignoring realistic site-specific ocean conditions that influence device performance such as vertical shear, surface waves, free-stream turbulence, and eccentricity of the tidal ellipse. Large-scale hydrodynamic models typically employ subgrid-scale approaches to model energy extraction using simple parameterizations to represent the influence of the device on the flowfield.\r\n\r\nThis project will apply a multi-model approach to link the scales of interest. Device scale simulations will be performed using a RANS CFD code with an optimal shape design capability. The shape design procedure uses a highly efficient approach based on control theory for construction of the gradient. For the larger scales necessary for impact assessment and site evaluation, an unstructured grid ocean model will be employed. The models will be coupled using a two-way approach. The device scale simulations will provide momentum loss and changes in turbulent kinetic energy needed for accurate subgrid-scale parameterization of energy extrac- tion in the ocean model. The ocean model will provide realistic flow conditions for the device scale simulations. The coupled approach will be applied to both idealized and realistic domains and will be capable of improving turbine performance in realistic conditions while simultaneously considering the potential impacts to the environment.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop and test a process for optimizing and evaluating tidal kinetic energy extraction across the entire range of critical scales. In particular, the multi-model approach will enable (1) automatic device shape design for increased efficiency in realistic flow conditions, (2) assessments of impact on circulation and sediment transport using accurate parameterizations of turbine effects. An important outcome of this research will be the development and demonstration of a suite of tools to support the planning and permitting processes for tidal energy installations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project focused on developing techniques and computational tools for optimizing the extraction of energy from ocean tides using turbines.   This effort was a collaborative study and our component of the work focused on the larger scales associated with the ocean while our collaborators focused on the smaller scales associated with individual tidal turbines.  In the first part of our effort we developed an approach to estimate the yield of array of turbines in a realistic channel.   For this work we used the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM).  FVCOM is a publicly available set of codes which solve the governing equations of the ocean to provide predictions of ocean currents, temperature, and salinity.   We modified FVCOM to model the two key effects of the turbines on the flowfield: the removal of momentum and the alterations to turbulent mixing in the water column.   In the second part of our effort we developed an approach for optimizing the layout of an array of tidal turbines with the goal of maximizing power production.  The approach used includes the ability to include technical constraints such as depth of operation or exclusion constraints imposed by navigation or essential species habitat. Our optimization technique is based on the continuous genetic algorithm, a branch of methods which employ basic evolutionary mechanisms such as inheritance, crossover, and mutation to proceed systematically toward an optimal design.  This optimization algorithm is coupled to FVCOM in order to model the feedback of the devices on the flowfield.   This coupled optimization-ocean model has been applied to an assessment of a pilot scale (5 megawatt) proposed project in Muskeget Channel, Massachusetts.  The annual production of energy was estimated for arrays constructed from two separate technologies, a large turbine requiring deep water and a more novel design that can be sited in shallower water. \n\nTwo graduate students conducted their thesis research on the project and received M.S. degrees, one in Marine Science and the other in Mechanical Engineering.  These students gained critical experience in numerical analysis and high-performance computing. The software developed with support of the project is readily available to other researchers.  The array optimization package is freely available through the popular open source repository github. The momentum extraction module is included with distributions of FVCOM.   This module has been used by researchers working on the massive proposed tidal power project in the Bay of Fundy, Canada.  With support from feedback from other researchers using this tool we continue to make improvements to the methodology that is implemented in the module. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoffrey W Cowles"
