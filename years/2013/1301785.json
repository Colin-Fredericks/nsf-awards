 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate the Galois cohomology groups of function fields of curves over number fields. Let F be the function field of a curve over a number field. If p is a prime and F contains a primitive pth root of unity, a symbol in degree n Galois cohomology is simply a cup product of elements in the degree one cohomology modulo p. Voevodsky's theorem implies that every element in the degree n Galois cohomology modulo p is a sum of symbols. It is proposed to study boundedness of symbol length for F for each prime p. This study has consequences for bounding the u-invariant of F. The PI also proposes to study questions concerning the admissibility of finite groups over function fields of curves over p-adic fields.\r\n\r\nA  basic pursuit of geometers and number theorist is to find common solutions of polynomial equations. A homogeneous polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic form.  It is known that every quadratic form in at least five variables over a totally imaginary number field has non-trivial zero, thanks to the Hasse-Minkowski theorem. It is an open question whether every quadratic form in sufficiently many variables over the function field of a curve over a totally imaginary number field has a non-trivial zero. By a theorem of Voevodsky, quadratic forms are classified by Galois cohomology invariants over any field. We propose to study the existence of non-trivial zeros for quadratic forms in sufficiently many variables over function fields of curves over totally imaginary number fields, by studying boundedness questions for symbol lengths in Galois cohomology.",

If F contains a primitive l th root of unit, then it is proved that every element in the third Galois cohomology group of F with coefficients in the group of  l th roots of unity is a symbol\n\nThe Brauer-Manin  obstruction is the only obstruction to the existence of a zero-cycle of degree one on certain classes of surfaces over finite fields.\n\n2) Lois de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; sup&eacute;rieures et points rationnels (jointly with J.L.

We have introduced a new obstruction to the local-global principle for principal  homogeneous spaces under connected linear algebraic groups over F. Using this obstruction constructed examples to show that rationality condition for local global principles in the patching setting of Harbater-Hartmann-Krashen is necessary. \n3) On the u-invariant of function elds of curves over complete discretely valued field (with R. Parimala,  Adv. Math. 280 (2015), 729-742.)\n\nLet K be a complete discretely valued field  and  F the function field of a curve over K.  Suppose that characteristic  of F is zero and the charateristic of the residue field  k of K is p &gt; 0. We give a bound for the p-Bruaer dimension of F in terms of the p-rank of k.

Suppose that characteristic  p of the residue field k  of K is positive. We show that the index of a central simple algebrara  over F with p-torsion is bounded in terms of the p-rack k.  \n\n5) Colliot-Thelene Conjecture and finiteness of the u-invariant (jointly with MacLieblich and R. Parimala, Math Annalen Volume 360 (2014), 1&ndash;22 )\n\nLet K be a number field and F the function field of a curve over K. Assuming a conjecture of Colliot-Thelene concerning the existence of zero-cycles of degree one, it is proved the symbol lengths of Galois cohomology groups of F is finite and as a consequence it is concluded that the u-invariant of F is finite if K has no ordering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suresh Venapally"
