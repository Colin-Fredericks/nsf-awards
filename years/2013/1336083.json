Kibbey/Charalambos Papelis\r\nThe University of Oklahoma/New Mexico State University\r\n\r\nNatural and engineered processes can cause the water content of soils in the unsaturated zone to vary significantly over time. Dynamic decreases in water content caused by evaporation can cause local increases in the concentrations of contaminants and other porewater constituents, which can drive enhanced contaminant sorption and the formation of contaminant precipitates. Because sorption/desorption and precipitation/dissolution processes tend to be strongly rate-limited, dynamic water content changes can have a strong influence on the long-term mobility of inorganic and organic contaminants, with these processes either increasing or decreasing long-term mobility. To date, little quantitative information is available that would allow realistic modeling of dynamic sorption or phase change processes in unsaturated media, or prediction of their impact on contaminant mobility. The objective of this work is to quantify the link between dynamic changes in water content and composition and the corresponding phase changes of contaminants that take place, with emphasis on quantifying the ultimate connection between phase changes and subsurface mobility. This project will initially focus on six separate chemical contaminants of environmental concern, four organic compounds and two inorganic compounds, all selected to exhibit a wide range of chemical behaviors (adsorption, speciation, complexation, solid formation) likely to influence behavior under dynamic unsaturated conditions. Work will be focused around three tightly-coupled tasks and will include 1) dynamic unsaturated experiments; 2) batch analyses and spectroscopic-microscopic measurements; and 3) coupled dynamic geochemical/unsaturated transport modeling to interpret the results of the first two tasks and to synthesize and expand the results of experimental work to better understand and predict environmental implications of phase change on long term contaminant mobility. The results of the proposed work will provide the tools needed to enhance our understanding of contaminant phase changes during natural and engineered changes in water content, and will provide quantitative information needed for enhanced decision making processes for managing and remediating contamination in the unsaturated zone.\r\n\r\nThe water content of soils can vary substantially over time either because of natural processes, such as precipitation and evaporation, or because of human activities. This water content variability can have a dramatic effect on the mobility of hazardous inorganic substances, such as metals and radioactive compounds, as well as organic substances, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and hydrocarbons. This project will enhance our ability to predict the movement of organic and inorganic contaminants in the soil environment as a function of soil water content. Our improved understanding of the link between soil water content and contaminant mobility in the soil will enable the development of improved soil remediation techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was centered around understanding how evaporation in soil pores can influence the long term fate and transport of environmental contaminants.  Natural and engineered processes can cause the water content of soils near the ground surface to vary significantly over time. Decreases in water content caused by evaporation can cause increases in the concentrations of contaminants, driving adsorption to solid surfaces and the formation of solid contaminant precipitates. Because these processes can be slow, water content changes can potentially have a strong influence on the long-term mobility of contaminants.\n\nThe project looked at the behaviors of a range of contaminants, including a number of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care product components.  Flow-through experiments were conducted to explore how contaminant physical properties influenced the dynamics of their remobilization and transport following evaporation of porewater to dryness.  A model was developed specifically for the work, to quantify the effect of dissolution rate effects on remobilization.  Results indicated that compounds that adsorbed more strongly to porous media during saturated transport were also those whose remobilization following porewater evaporation was most strongly influenced by rate limited dissolution.  An interesting finding of the work was that, particularly for the most mobile compounds studied, concentrations initially leaving a porous medium during remobilization can be much higher than the concentrations initially present, as a result of the infiltrating water front dissolving the chemical as it sweeps through the initially dry porous medium.  This behavior could lead to unexpectedly high concentration spikes entering groundwater during infiltration of rainwater after periods of drought.\n\nResearch for the project also examined the effect of surfactants on the remobilization of triclosan following evaporation.  The reason to study the effect of surfactants is that surfactants &ndash; major components of soaps and detergents &ndash; generally accompany antibacterial agents such as triclosan in commercial antibacterial products.  Results found that surfactants significantly increased the dissolution rate for triclosan, and that the effect could be predicted based on calculations with a model developed for the work.  The implication of the result was that predictions of triclosan mobility based on experiments conducted with pure triclosan may underestimate the mobility.\n\nFinally, experiments were conducted to study the patterns of precipitation on single sand grains.  The experiments found that many compounds precipitate on ridges rather than in valleys, as a result of the hydraulic motion in water films that results from evaporation.  The results of this work may ultimately provide new insights into understanding how changing amounts of accessible interfacial area during dissolution impacts the rate of dissolution and release for environmental chemicals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tohren C Kibbey"
