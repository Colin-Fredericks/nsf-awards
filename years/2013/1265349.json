 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to accelerate the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics that delay aging and could be used in the treatment of age-related diseases. To this end, researchers are developing a process that allows them to quickly identify candidate anti-aging compounds based on their effects on cell division parameters. Researchers then evaluate the ability of these compounds to delay aging of single-celled and invertebrate model organisms. Other approaches to identify compounds that delay aging focus on modulation of gene products implicated in aging. The approach used through this work selects compounds for further study based on their effects on cell division. This process may be more unbiased and may allow for a much quicker evaluation of candidate therapeutics.  \r\n \r\nBuilding on previous research, this project, if successful, plans to develop technology and products to applications that could benefit society. Current approaches to treat age-related pathologies are frequently disease-specific. The approach used in this project is designed to modulate the aging process itself, potentially influencing the outcome of diseases for which age is a key risk factor.",
