 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel hyperosmotic nanoemulsions for the prevention and treatment of infected wounds. Wound infections, whether acute or chronic, affects millions of Americans and have significant monetary and physiologic impacts on patient quality of life. Current therapies that rely on antibiotics are becoming limited due to the frequency of antibiotic drug resistance. For example, the CDC estimates that drug resistance has increased 36% in the last twenty years. To reduce the reliance on broad spectrum antibiotics, this research aims to develop a new class (non-antibiotic) of topical therapeutics known as hyperosmotic nanoemulsions. The intellectual merit of the proposed technology is the novel mechanism of bactericidal action (for infection prevention/treatment) coupled to the concomitant acceleration in wound healing. This proposal is intended to define the optimal treatment dosage necessary to move the technology into human clinical testing. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the applicability of hyperosmotic nanoemulsions to become a standard first option in wound management protocol. Currently, market products either mitigate the infection or reduce healing times. However, hyperosmotic nanoemulsions are intended to treat both the underlying infection and actively promote the stages of wound healing. This dual-fold action is poised to disrupt the market of advanced wound dressings, which is estimated to be $1.2B and growing 10% annually. Other markets that may be addressed with the proposed technology include topical acne, antiviral and antifungal segments. The proposed platform technology may ultimately prove to be an alternative or supplement to traditional drugs and reshape both veterinary and human clinical practice.",
