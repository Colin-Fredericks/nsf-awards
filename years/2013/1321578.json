 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project brings together computational enzyme design with systems biology to create a fully integrated platform for novel pathway designs. The approach chosen will combine specific databases and a novel pathway synthesis tool. This computational tool will use the information present in the databases to automatically discover, or \"design\", novel pathways for fermenting natural renewable feedstock to virtually any chemical of human interest. In the Phase II Experimental Plan, the goal is to further advance the concept by developing a high-performance pathway prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism metabolism, and experimentally test the performance of the system. To our knowledge, the proposed research is the first attempt of combining computational enzyme design with computational pathway prospecting and modeling.\t \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to engineer biosystems and cell factories for industrial applications, especially in the field of bio-based chemicals and biofuels.  Most successes to date in the field of synthetic biology have involved recombining natural enzyme building blocks into novel pathways. However, recent developments in computational enzyme design make it possible to have designer enzymes to enhance nature's catalytic repertoire. Being able to have an automated, computer-aided design tool that leverages new capabilities to create novel metabolic pathways employing synthetic enzymes will bring us closer to truly synthetic biology.",

In particular, one of the long-standing aims of synthetic biology is to be able to rationally engineering gain-of-function in microbial organisms: program them like a computer to be able to produce novel chemicals not known to nature or synthetized by organic chemistry.\nBuilding on previous accomplishments of Arzeda to design computationally novel enzymes with the desired catalytic activity, this project is aimed at developing a comprehensive suite of both computational and molecular biology tool to automate the design of novel metabolic pathways for the production of potentially any chemical. In the Phase I, we have focused on the first step: designing a computational design tool, analogous to CAD tools used by aircraft manufacturer down to furniture makes, to assist in the rapid prospecting and design of novel metabolic routes for the production of a given chemical from a given set of metabolites.\nThe objective of the Phase I work were as (1) to develop a set of highly curated databases representing chemical reactions that can be catalyzed by either natural or designed enzymes, (2) to develop a pathway prospecting tool, that is able to tap into the database of (1) and propose realistic pathways connecting a query metabolite set with a query chemical to be produced, and (3) to test the performance of the software on a benchmark set consisting of multiple natural and engineering metabolic pathways.\nArzeda was successful in all aspects of this Phase I, and the major outcome of this Phase I grant is an operational software platform. These positive results and the software were presented in plenary sessions in a variety of scientific conferences, including Metabolic Engineering IX (Vancouver, BC), the Society for Industrial Microbiology Symposium on Fuels and Chemicals (Clearwater Beach, FL) and the Gordon Conference on Biocatalysis (Smithfield, RI). This resulted significant industrial interest by leading multinational companies in the field of chemicals, cosmetics and food ingredients. More generally, the tools developed in this program, especially with the completion of the Phase II work, will have a long-standing impact on our ability to produce chemicals from renewable feedstock grown in the US instead of petroleum overwhelmingly sourced from foreign countries. Being able to produce by fermentation, with novel pathways, small molecules hard to synthetize or extracted from endangered, natural resources is also rendered possible by our tools and will have an important impact on preserving the earth\u00c6s biodiversity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexandre Zanghellini"
