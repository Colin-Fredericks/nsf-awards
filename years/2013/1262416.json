Metabolomics is a rapidly developing field of\r\n?omics? research concerned with the high-throughput identification and quantitation of small molecule\r\nmetabolites in the metabolome.

However, a sizable fraction of these compounds\r\nare unknown and a new computational infrastructure is required for processing the complex mass\r\nspectral data and identifying and characterizing these metabolites. This project addresses this need by\r\ndeveloping a computational workflow that will create libraries of high-quality mass spectra for unknown\r\ncompounds from many samples.
