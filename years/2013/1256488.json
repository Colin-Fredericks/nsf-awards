 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major mode of communication among animals within a species is via chemicals collectively called pheromones. Pheromone communication can alter both development and behavior, but the exact response elicited is determined by both the internal state and the external environment of the animal. The overall goal of this project is to understand how animals integrate pheromone signals together with other cues to direct the appropriate response. The nematode C. elegans provides an excellent experimental system in which to study pheromone signaling. These animals communicate with each other using a complex mixture of chemicals, which regulate both the development of young animals, as well as behaviors of adult animals. The genetic pathways by which pheromone signals are sensed and interpreted in the context of other signals such as food availability to regulate development will be identified and characterized. In collaboration with physicists and engineers, assays will be designed to examine behavioral and nervous system responses to pheromones in different environmental contexts, and the underlying mechanisms of signal integration will be investigated. This work will lead to a greater understanding of how animals interact with each other and their environment, and how natural or artificial environmental disruptions impact animal survival and reproduction. \r\n\r\nThis work will enhance student learning and training and improve public awareness of chemical communication. In addition, it will promote interdisciplinary collaborations among biologists, chemists, physicists and engineers improving on technology development that can be used to understand how the sense of smell affects animal behavior. This is important for overall human wellbeing since the sense of smell is known to affect human stress, mental and physical performance, pain, sleep, and weight control.",
