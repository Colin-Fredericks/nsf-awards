 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicore platforms have the potential of revolutionizing the capabilities of embedded cyber-physical systems. Unfortunately, when such systems have safety-critical components, multicore platforms are rarely used. The reason is a lack of predictability associated with hardware components such as caches, memory controllers, etc., that are shared among cores. With current technology, very conservative estimates concerning the usage of these shared resources must be made, to certify that overuse violations do not occur at runtime. The resulting over-provisioning can be significant, easily negating the processing power of any additional cores. The goal of this project is to resolve this multicore \"predictability problem\" by developing allocation mechanisms that enable shared hardware resources to be controlled in a predictable way. The research agenda in this project includes fundamental research on relevant real-time resource allocation problems, prototyping efforts involving real-time operating systems and middleware, and experimental evaluations of improvements enabled by the developed mechanisms in timing analysis tools (which are used to determine task execution-time budgets).\r\n\r\nAddressing the \"predictability problem\" associated with multicore platforms would be a breakthrough result for safety-critical, cyber-physical systems in domains such as avionics and automobiles. When using multicore platforms to host highly-critical workloads in these domains, the current state of the art is to obviate the predictability problem by turning off all but one core. Unless a more intelligent solution can be found, such domains will not benefit from savings in size, weight, and power (SWaP) and gains in functionality that multicore platforms afford. Broader impacts include joint research with industry colleagues on supporting real-time workloads in unmanned air vehicles, the development of publicly-available open-source software that can be used by other institutions for research and teaching purposes, and the development of a new course on cyber-physical systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nReal-time systems are systems in which some computations have deadline \nconstraints.  For example, when the brake pedal of a car is depressed, \nthe car should begin to slow within a specified number of milliseconds.  \nThe computations that must be supported within a real-time system are \nusually called \"tasks.\"  (A task is essentially just a computer \nprogram.)  To save on hardware costs, it is often the case that many \ntasks with separate deadline requirements have to be supported on the \nsame hardware platform.  To ensure that each task meets its deadline \nrequirements, a real-time scheduler must be used within the operating \nsystem that is cognizant of task deadlines and schedules tasks accordingly.\n\nFrom the perspective of designing and realizing real-time systems, one \nof the most profound recent developments in the computing arena is the \nadvent of multicore computers.  Such computers actually consist of \nmultiple processors.  Thus, a multicore computer can execute many tasks \nin parallel, i.e., at the same time. Unfortunately, when tasks execute \nin parallel on a multicore computer, they may \"interfere\" with each \nother.  Such interference occurs when tasks executing on different \nprocessors access shared-hardware resources like caches and memory banks \nat the same time.  This kind of interference causes the execution times \nof tasks to increase.  This is because, when tasks interfere with each \nother, the cache and memory accesses of an individual task may take \nlonger to complete.\n\nThis project was directed at the design of scheduling and \nresource-allocation methods for real-time systems that enable \ninterference caused by shared-hardware resources on a multicore computer \nto be either eliminated or reduced.  By eliminating or reducing \ninterference, individual tasks can be guaranteed to complete execution \nwithin a shorter amount of time in the worst case.  Such worst-case \nreductions enable multicore computers to be more efficiently utilized \nwhen deadline requirements must be ensured.\n\nTwo shared-hardware resources were the major focus of the project: \non-chip shared caches and off-chip shared memory.  Additionally, the \ntask systems that were considered were largely motivated by requirements \nin avionics systems, where tasks of different criticalities must be \nsupported.  When multicore computers are used in the avionics industry \ntoday, the common practice is to disable all but one core if any tasks \nof high criticality exist, in order to eliminate the possibility of any \ninterference.  Experiments conducted in this project showed that, in \ncomparison to this common practice, the proposed methods for dealing \nwith interference enabled up to an eight-fold increase in the amount of \nprocessing that could be supported on a multicore computer with four cores.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, the investigators presented talks on this\nwork at numerous institutions, conferences, workshops, etc.\nAdditionally, the results of this project formed the basis of the\ndissertations of three graduate students at UNC and two Ph.D. students\n(one defended, one ongoing) plus 3 M.S. students (M.S. thesis\ndefended) at NC State.  The results from this project have also\nimpacted how the topic of multicore real-time computing is taught at\nthe investigators' institutions.  The investigators also made\npresentations concerning the results of this project to colleagues in\nthe avionics industry and established contacts to other industries,\nsuch as power, automotive, and semiconductors.  As a result of these\ncontacts and presentations, future interactions with some of these\ncolleagues have been planned that will involve the application of the\nmethods developed in this project in actual avionics and other\nindustrial systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank Mueller"
