 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to carry out its responsibilities as the United States National Member Organization (NMO) of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). These responsibilities take two forms: participating in governance of the Institute through participation in the IIASA Council and direct interaction with the organization; and facilitating and encouraging U.S. interest in IIASA's activities. The Board on International Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the U.S. Committee for IIASA, chaired by Professor Don Saari of the University of California, Irvine.  IIASA was established in 1972 as a multilateral, non-governmental research institution devoted to interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research.  At IIASA, multidisciplinary, international teams of researchers conduct research on issues related to environmental, technological, and economic aspects of global change, including energy and technology, population, and natural resources. The Institute thus serves as a neutral forum for sustained investigation and discussion of global and international issues. It is located in Laxenburg, Austria, near Vienna.  The intellectual merit of the proposal consists of the work by the U.S. NMO, in collaboration with interested U.S. researchers and Government agencies, to formulate U.S. views regarding IIASA's research, budget, and administration. This helps to insure the integrity of the Institute and guides the IIASA research program in ways that will maintain its quality and its relevance to U.S. research and policy concerns. The NMO works to broaden the impact of the Institute and its work by serving as a liaison to the U.S. science, technology, and policy communities, with the goal of increasing participation in and awareness of IIASA by Americans in academia, government, business, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This includes recruiting for and funding IIASA's Young Scientists Summer Program for advanced graduate students; helping to find suitable candidates for IIASA's job vacancies; serving as the hub of a national network of interested scholars and policymakers; and helping IIASA to find opportunities to participate in national policy debates.  The chairman of the U.S. Committee represents the U.S. NMO at IIASA's Council meetings. The Council is composed of representatives from the 16 NMO's; each NMO country pays an annual membership contribution. The U.S. Council member works with the Director of IIASA, the IIASA Council Program Committee, and the IIASA Science Advisory Committee to guide and strengthen the IIASA research program. The U.S. national committee carries out an annual review of IIASA's research progress, soliciting comments from academic, government, and other experts in the U.S. scientific community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) serves as the U.S. member of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), located outside Vienna, Austria.  The NAS? Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) houses the U.S. National Member Organization (NMO) for IIASA.  Specific goals in this grant were to assist in the governance of IIASA, and influence its research agenda; engage U.S. scientists and professional organizations in IIASA programs; and identify the IIASA-related needs of U.S. scientists, professional groups, and government agencies, and connect them to IIASA programs and opportunities.\n\nScientific Merit\n\nThe IIASA Council meets semi-annually, and all member countries have a representative.  The U.S. representatives, first Don Saari (University of California, Irvine) and then Michael Clegg (University of California, Irvine), both served as IIASA Council Chair.  The U.S. representative to the IIASA Council also serves as Chair of the U.S. NMO.  This allows regular information flow between the IIASA and the NMO.\n\nDuring this grant period, the IIASA Research Plan, 2016-2020 was developed and approved.  The U.S. NMO made a number of specific recommendations that were included in it. \n\nAn external review of IIASA was conducted in 2016-2017.  Because a number of U.S. NMO members have long-term, in-depth knowledge of IIASA, the committee provided considerable input to the review team. \n\nA joint meeting on March 27, 2014 with the NRC?s Polar Research Board (PRB) and a number of government representatives to discuss the development and application of scenarios of Arctic change.  As a result, IIASA was able to provide input to key individuals staffing the U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council from April 2015 to May 2017. \n\nThe U.S. NMO has promoted closer collaboration between IIASA and the U.S.-based Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS).  Don Saari arranged for Pavel Kabat, the Director General/CEO of IIASA, to give the keynote address at the INFORMS meeting in October 2013. \n\nShortly thereafter, Steve Robinson (University of Wisconsin-Madison), a U.S. NMO member and a former president of INFORMS, proposed a Systems Analysis Conference.  Dr. Robinson and other INFORMS leaders worked with IIASA staff to organize the conference held at IIASA in November 2015.  They also involved the Sante Fe Institute, and the two U.S. organizations served as two of the three cosponsors of the event.  During the conference, IIASA issued a call for proposals for small exploratory and innovative projects involving IIASA research teams and external, non-IIASA researchers.  The call yielded 28 project proposals, and eight were selected for funding. \n\nIn February 2016, U.S. NMO held a series of events highlighting IIASA?s relevance and value to the United States.  One of these events, a symposium, International Scientific Cooperation for Global Sustainability: Three Topics, addressed how to measure progress toward the United Nation?s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the use of biological carbon sequestration in meeting climate goals, and the challenges of a rapidly changing Arctic.  \n\nThe U.S. NMO also worked with IIASA to plan sessions and events at the 2018 AAAS meeting.  These featured IIASA?s research and its connections to the U.S. science community and addressed migration, the importance of international research organizations in science and diplomacy, and science in the SDGs. Pavel Kabat also gave a keynote address. The goal of these sessions was to make the U.S. scientific community more aware of IIASA?s research and tools.\n\nTwo exchange visits between the Russian and U.S. NMOs took place.  The first, in California in April 2013, explored new classes of mathematical problems in geology, and techniques that could help; evolutionary game theory; and new themes in systems analysis.  The second meeting, in October 2013 in Russia, led to the establishment of research connections between Michigan Technological University and the Russian School of Mines in St. Petersburg. \n\nIn 2014, Mexico became a member of IIASA.  IIASA needs active and engaged members, and to assist the Mexican NMO and explore common areas of interest and concern, the U.S. committee held a joint meeting of the U.S. and Mexican NMOs in February 2015.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nIIASA is dedicated to training the next generation of systems analysis researchers, and each summer hosts about 50 advanced graduate students from around the world in its Young Scientists Summer Program (YSSP).  Around twelve each year come from the United States.  BISO and the U.S. NMO work closely with IIASA to promote this program to U.S. graduate students. \n\nThree former YSSPers attended the U.S. NMO?s 2016 meeting.  They asked for more opportunities for continued interactions between the former YSSPers, both from the U.S. and worldwide.  This led to the organization of a special YSSP conference at IIASA in June 2017 for YSSP alumni from 1977-2017.  U.S. NMO members helped organize this meeting. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine E Bailey"
