This capability is a key EarthCube\r\nmission mentioned in reports of several EarthCube domain workshops and roadmaps. We envision\r\na comprehensive system linking geoscience resources, users, publications, usage information,\r\nand cyberinfrastructure (CI) components. It will supplement information included in existing\r\ndata discovery catalogs by integrating feedback from users on their experience with resources,\r\nby providing characterization of resources in an interoperability assessment framework, and\r\nby supporting registration of mappings between information models and vocabularies to assist\r\ndata integration. To assess interoperability among components an open source validation mechanism\r\nwill be implemented. The system will enable community input and access by geoscientists via\r\nonline user interfaces, and will provide documented web service APIs so that inventory information\r\ncan be easily browsed, analyzed, and integrated within the emerging EarthCube CI. The project\r\nteam will collaborate with related EarthCube efforts, including Building Blocks, RCNs, domain\r\nworkshop and the Test Enterprise Governance. The PIs will work with researchers from selected geoscience domains\r\n(stratigraphy, hydrology, critical zone science) to validate and demonstrate advanced features\r\nof CINERGI in specific research context.\r\n\r\nCINERGI is a direct response to the communitys need for easy discovery, assessment, and utilization\r\nof CI resources, expressed by many EarthCube stakeholders. It is a fundamental building block\r\nof an Earth Science CI and will serve geoscientists across all domains to efficiently and\r\nin more informed manner use existing and emerging resources for productive and transformative\r\nresearch. It will also help CI experts and computer scientists to align new developments better\r\nwith existing resources such as vocabularies, ontologies, data exchange protocols, or metadata\r\nschemas.",
