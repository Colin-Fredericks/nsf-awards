 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Mark Grinstaff from Boston University (BU) will acquire a micro-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (micro-MALDI-TOF). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) electrochemistry of diheme cytochrome c peroxidases; (b) bacteriophobic coatings for inhibition of pathogenic biofilms; (c) synthesis and reactivity of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) belts; (d) improvement of nanoparticle functionalization strategies; and (e) studies of inhibitors and activators of protein-protein interactions.\r\n\r\nMass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. A critical gap exists in the current mass spectrometric capabilities on the BU Charles River Campus because there is no instrument of the type needed to support chemical research in the life processes, chemistry and nanotechnology. The new instrument on the Charles River Campus would directly and immediately impact and enhance the projects of more than 40 graduate, 10 undergraduate, and 10 post-doctoral researchers. The new instrument would be available to other scientists and educators at BU, as well as outside institutions such as Emmanuel College, with whom BU has partnered in advancing education and research.",
