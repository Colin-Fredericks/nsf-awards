 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of knowing the different sources of atmospheric nitrate to the polar ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, along with their transport paths, is of intrinsic interest to the atmospheric chemistry of polar NOx species. In turn, surface photolysis of snowpack nitrate renders these ice sheets as strongly oxidizing surfaces during sunlight.  Attempts to derive past conditions or variability of atmospheric NOx (= NO + NO2 +?) species from ice core records will need to take photodenitrification and source transfer function effects into account.  \r\n\r\nThe approach willcontinue to use a inverse chemical transfer model (adjoint GEOS-Chem) to test the sensitivity of nitrate deposition to the Antarctic continent from various possible sources. The following questions are posed: 1) what are the important sources of nitrate to Antarctia (and Greenland) in the present and in the pre-industrial Holocene? 2) How does the recycling of reactive nitrogen at the atmosphere-snow interface redistribute nitrate across large polar ice sheets? and  3) are their implications for nitrate preservation in ice cores and their interpretation?\r\n\r\nGoals being pursued in this modeling study include the reconstruction of past (polar) atmospheric composition and a better contemporary understanding of the variability of atmospheric reactive nitrogen compounds as may be discerned from measurements of nitrate concentrations retained in snow, firn and possibly ice cores in polar regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBy simulating snow photochemistry in a global model for the first time, we can examine the spatial patterns of redistribution of nitrate across snow covered regions.  This will enable us and our community to put these processes into context with other major processes governing the tropospheric nitrogen cycle.  We can also separately examine the impacts of nitrate photochemistry on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in polar-regions, which will help inform the relative magnitude of role of other snow photolytic processes.  Our snowpack actinic flux parameterization will be useful for calculating other snow photochemical reactions that influence species such as mercury in polar regions.\n\nWe have also for the first time used a global model to examine the sources of total nitrate in Antarctica.  Total nitrate is an oxidation product of nitrogenoxides  in the atmosphere associated with important environmental issues such as aeroso concentrations and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.  Using models to interpret experimental measurements of nitrate in the Antarctic snowpack helps us better understand the climate record contained within the chemistry of Antractic ice-core samples, and the role that natural versus human driven sources of nitrate may have had on atmopsheric chemistry. \n\nOne of the key challenges confronting policy makers is planning for the consequences of future climate change.  Snow photochemical reactions can have large impacts on the oxidative capacity in polar-regions, and potentially in seasonally snow covered regions of the mid-latitudes.  This has implications for the chemical composition of the atmosphere, with potential direct and indirect implications for concentrations of air pollutants.  Snow covered regions are quite sensitive to changes in climate, and changing snow cover may influence not just the albedo of the Earth\u00c6s surface, but also have implications for the chemical composition of the overlying atmosphere. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daven K Henze"
