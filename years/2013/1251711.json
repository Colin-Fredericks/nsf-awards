 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals often avoid information that may be negative or unpleasant.  For example, they may avoid getting tested for a disease or avoid obtaining information related to their disease risk despite the fact that early knowledge can often increase the efficacy of treatment.  What leads individuals to avoid information, and are there factors that can reduce this resistance?  Much of the research on information avoidance has been conducted in the context of health, examining how individuals manage potentially negative health-related information.  Building on these theoretical and empirical findings, this research project will extend into the environmental domain and examine the psychology of \"environmental information avoidance,\" or people's failure to seek out or even actively avoid information about climate change and other environmental threats.  Individuals may engage in environmental information avoidance (a) to minimize unpleasant emotions, such as dread, worry, or hopelessness; (b) to avoid feelings of personal responsibility and guilt that might compel them to take undesired environmental actions (or refrain from desired actions); or (c) to avoid pressure to abandon or revise cherished personal beliefs that environmental information might call into question.  In addition, people may avoid information about environmental threats as part of a strategic strategy designed to persuade themselves that such threats are in fact not worrisome.  Eleven studies will experimentally test factors that contribute to information avoidance as well as those that decrease this effect.\r\n\r\nThis research project responds to recent calls for behavioral scientists to address the \"human\" side of climate change.  Its results are expected to be useful for advancing basic psychological theory.  It may also assist in the development of theoretically grounded, evidence-based approaches to better understand why different people react in markedly different ways to information about possible threats in environmental and other domains.  Better knowledge regarding how individuals seek and respond to information about the environment may help in the formulation of educational plans and policies.  Because human choice and behavior play an important role in environmental problems, a consideration of human psychology can be an important part of the solution.  Because this project will be conducted at a predominantly undergraduate institution, it will provide opportunities to involve many undergraduate students meaningfully in psychological research, preparing them for graduate study in psychology and other behavioral sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award (1251711; RUI: Information Avoidance and the Environment) facilitated research on \"environmental information avoidance,\" people\u2019s reluctance to seek out (and, in some cases, actively avoid) information about threats to the natural environment, including their own role in those threats.  My students and I conducted numerous experiments designed to navigate the psychology of environmental information avoidance.  As anticipated, this research has demonstrated the applicability of research on health-related information avoidance to the domain of the natural environment.  Specifically, our experiments have shown that people avoid information about threats to the natural environment (1) because such information sometimes entails personal obligations (including self-imposed obligations) to act in certain ways that limit individuals\u2019 sense of autonomy, (2) because such information sometimes challenges individuals\u2019 cherished beliefs and ideologies, and (3) because such information sometimes creates unwanted emotional experiences, including worry, dread, and guilt. \n\nIn addition, my students and I have also demonstrated that people tend to avoid information about threats to the natural environment when such information risks causing them to experience the unpleasant feelings associated with hypocrisy.  Specifically, although individuals can be relatively willing to learn about threats to the natural environment when those threats can be blamed on an outside entity, such as international corporations, they tend to avoid such information when it (a) implicates their own culpability, especially when (b) they have recently engaged in pro-environmental advocacy.  In other words, people avoid information about their own role in environmental threats when such information requires the fact that they themselves don\u2019t always \"practice\" what they \"preach.\"  We term this tendency \"environmental hypocrisy avoidance.\"  Ironically, to the extent that pro-environmental advocacy is a necessary element in environmental hypocrisy avoidance, individuals who are most committed to environmental causes may be among those most prone to environmental hypocrisy avoidance because they are especially likely to engage in pro-environmental advocacy.\n\nAll of this research is ongoing and publication of numerous findings awaits the results of preregistered replication studies.  In the meantime, this funding has allowed many undergraduate students to participate in the research process and learn firsthand about how research is done.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth K Savitsky"
