 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Oberlin College to form two regional networks in support of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE). Last September, the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in the undergraduate life science education community.  Fellows from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities were selected. All Fellows met in October, 2012 and organized into four working groups for developing approaches to help departments implement recommendations made in the Vision and Change report. Such improvements in how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions should increase student learning of core concepts, should increase retention rates for students in the sciences, and should prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.  \r\n\r\nAlthough individual faculty have been very active in instituting reforms in their own courses, it is usually harder to transform an entire department. This proposal plans to address that challenge by continuing to develop regional networks of institutions so they can support and advise one another as each implements change. Tools and resources have been developed by the Leadership Fellows that will be field-tested by the different types of participating institutions in the Midwest/Great Plains and New England. For example, PULSE Rubrics for departmental self-assessment and visits by trained Ambassadors are available to assist departments in adopting evidence-based strategies to increase student engagement and enrich the learning experience for all students. The networks will also pilot a systems-based evaluation scheme designed to identify leverage points for systemic reform via tests of hypotheses on ingredients of successful reform strategies. The resulting insights and the scheme itself will inform and benefit other efforts to effect systemic change in higher education. Results from these regional activities and the evaluation will be shared with the life sciences community, primarily via the www.pulsecommunity.org website and by continued partnerships with other national organizations groups advocating for change in undergraduate life science education.\r\n\r\nThis project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe heart of this project is a vision of the United States as the leading country in scientific innovation, meeting challenges in the life sciences ranging from ensuring a sustainable food supply to reducing vulnerability to bio-terrorist attacks and medical epidemics.  Stoking this innovation will be undergraduate science programs that deepen students? conceptual understanding, spark wonder and appreciation for science, develop scientific competencies, and meet the nation?s need for a scientifically literate citizenry and technically skilled workforce.  To advance toward this vision, the project established two educational networks, one across the Great Plains and Midwest and one in Western New England.  Both focused on spurring the organizational, department-level change needed for heightening alignment of undergraduate life sciences programs with inclusive, evidence-based practices and the nation?s blueprint for enhancing undergraduate biology education, Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action.  Both networks, too, were endeavors of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE), an initiative launched in 2012 by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and the National Institute for General Medical Sciences (NIGMS/NIH) as an effort to stimulate life science departments to undertake the type of transformative changes recommended in the Vision and Change report.\n\n \n\nThe project equipped teams from biology departments in higher education within the Midwest, Great Plains, and Western New England with strategies and leadership skills helpful for guiding departments through difficult discussions and heightening alignment of institutional behaviors and practices with those linked by evidence to inclusivity and enhanced students' outcomes.  The Great Plains and Midwest Network grew to include 46 institutional members: 10 community colleges (Associates), 6 baccalaureate colleges (Bachelors), 17 regional comprehensive institutions (Masters), and 13 doctoral/research universities.  The Western New England Network grew to 23 members: 11 community colleges, 5 baccalaureate colleges, 6 regional comprehensive institutions, and 1 doctoral/research university.\n\n \n\nAssessment data documented advances made by Network members in implementing inclusive practices and behaviors.  Data revealed five roles played by the Networks and their workshops in spurring transformation: (i) they provided the dedicated time and structure for institutional teams to produce a concrete plan for transformation; (ii) they made possible a learning from and a \"giving and taking\" with other institutional teams facing similar challenges; (iii) they enabled important connections to be made among institutions and people; (iv) they provided inspiration, encouragement, and a way to maintain momentum; and (v) they catalyzed benchmarking and goal-setting.\n\n \n\nTwo online resources were developed, one on assessment and one on creative problem solving and facilitative leadership skills; both reside in the PULSE Community webpages (Online Workshop).  A research manuscript describing the Networks' workshops and assessment data on their efficacy is being composed for submission to an education research journal.\n\n \n\nThe Networks are dedicated to bringing effective, innovative teaching and learning experiences to students through implementation of the restructured approach to biology education described in the Vision and Change report.  That the Networks -- and the larger PULSE effort -- target transformation of departmental and institutional practices and behaviors distinguishes the Networks and PULSE from projects aiming to change practices classroom by classroom, instructor by instructor.  Thus, at an organizational level, the Networks directly work toward the societally relevant outcome of boosting retention and learning of students from all backgrounds&mdash;racial, ethnic, geographic, gender, socioeconomic&mdash;in undergraduate biology programs.  In so doing, the Networks increase the number of persons equipped with the scientific and technical skills supportive of a vibrant national ecosystem for innovation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Taylor Allen"
