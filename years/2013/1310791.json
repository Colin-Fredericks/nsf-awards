 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Peter Charles Albert Johnson of Virginia Commonwealth University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Geothermal, Reservoir Engineering and Environmental Fluids group in the Department of Engineering Science at The University of in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is \"Inverse Computer Modeling of Geothermal Reservoirs.\" The host scientist is Professor Mike O'Sullivan.\r\n\r\nModels of geothermal reservoirs that are used by a geothermal power plant are essential for understanding a reservoir's properties. Determining these properties through inverse methods is vital for managing power plants, and by using a calibrated numerical model of heat and mass flow within a given geothermal reservoir, reservoir properties can be determined. This research investigates uses of software such as PEST (Parameter ESTimation) and iTOUGH2 (Inverse Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat 2) to dramatically improve the accuracy of the reservoir models.  This has the potential to facilitate the implementation of geothermal power generation in geologically suitable locations across the United States, which can provide continuous base-load electrical power in a sustainable, economical, and carbon reducing manner, especially when compared to electricity generated from fossil-fuel sources. This renewable domestic energy resource will not only lower greenhouse emissions and aide the United States quest for energy independence, but will also reduce the negative impacts of mining for other natural resources such as coal and uranium.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  The results of this work will be disseminated to the scientific community through presentations at conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.  The Fellow will work with his U.S. advisor to present the important aspects of geothermal power to visiting middle school and high school students through summer enrichment programs hosted at VCU and to their teachers through programs like GreenSTEM@VCU.",
