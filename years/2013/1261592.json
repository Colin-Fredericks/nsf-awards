 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative program of research, education and training based on the Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI) Workshop and the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling (GSMM) Camp.  These annual meetings, held during successive weeks in June, attract graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty from universities, and applied mathematicians, scientists and engineers from industry.  This award funds the MPI and GSSM for the summer of 2013, 2014, and 2015.  The MPI Workshop will be held in 2013 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA; in 2014 at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ; and in 2015 at the University of Delaware in Newark, DE.   The GSSM Camp will be held each year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  The focus of the MPI Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry.  These problems span a wide range of areas of applications, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others.  Recent problems have included, for example, mathematical models for electromagnetic wave interactions with nanostructures, mathematical problems related to drawing of glass sheets, medical ultrasonic imaging, and automatic defect recognition in industrial inspection applications.  The work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students.  The scientific objective of the activity generated by the Workshop and its intellectual merit is the study of mathematical problems of significant interest for industrial applications.  The GSMM Camp is held during the week prior to the Workshop, and graduate students attending the Camp also attend the Workshop.  The main objective of the Camp is graduate student education and training.  At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems are carefully chosen to promote a rich set of problem-solving skills, both analytical and numerical, and to provide a warm-up for the challenging problems considered at the Workshop.  The two meetings complement each other and form a comprehensive program of interdisciplinary research, education and training that is unique amongst universities in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe project is an ongoing effort organized by the principal investigators at RPI, WPI, NJIT and UD.  The MPI Workshop has run annually for the past 27 years with the principal aim of promoting research and education in applied mathematics and of developing links between mathematicians at universities and scientists and engineers from industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.  For the past 9 years, the research and educational activities of the Workshop have been enhanced by the introduction of the GSMM Camp.  In addition to these established meetings, the project involves a number of new activities associated with the Workshop and Camp designed to further advance the research and educational objectives of the collaborative program.  These activities include the introduction of a graduate student fellowship program, support for early-career mathematicians to attend the meetings, and the development of a graduate student exchange program in cooperation with the Oxford Center for Collaborative Applied Mathematics.  Overall, the Workshop and Camp, and its associated activities, have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research and educational activities of participating faculty.  The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and has an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    In recent years, professional and governmental societies have become increasingly aware of the importance of providing mathematicians with exposure to and training in industrial mathematics.  Not only does the industrial area provide an additional pool of professional opportunities for students, but also having highly-trained mathematicians working to advance industrial knowledge is in the best interests of the nation.  To that end, this project funded the joint program of the education-focused Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp (Camp) and the research-focused Mathematical Problems in Industry Workshop (MPI). \n    During the course of the project, hundreds of graduate students attended the Camp.  While there, they worked in teams with the guidance of invited faculty mentors on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems reflected a wide range of application areas:\n\nAtomic force microscopy\nBridge and suspension design\nClimate modeling\nCredit risk\nCutting with water\nData assimilation\nExtraction from sugarcane\nFuel cells\nIn vivo drug delivery\nMicroscopic organisms and structures\nPorous media filtration\nProperties of plant cells\nSleep structure\n\n\nThe problems are carefully chosen to promote a rich set of analytical and numerical problem-solving skills.  The interactive nature of the group's efforts also helps to foster `superskills', such as teamwork and presentation skills.\n\n    Campers then travel to MPI, where they join vertically-integrated teams of faculty, postdocs, and students to work on open-ended, research-level problems presented by industrial scientists in need of immediate solutions.  Over the course of the grant, hundreds more faculty and postdocs participated in MPI, working on a wide range of problems, as listed below:\n\nW. L. Gore (6 years): Porous media filters, SO2 modules\nCorning (4 years): Oxide ceramics, fused silica, elastic shells and beams\nClypd (3 years): TV advertising markets\nRevon (3 years): Data-based prediction/treatment of asthma, COPD\nPall (2 years): Filtration media\nBloom Energy: Fuel cells\nBoeing: Actuating platform systems \nCertara: Treatment of age-related macular degeneration\nCoVar Applied Technologies: Remote sensing\nIterex: Data-based prediction of chronic illness\nJet Propulsion Laboratory: Coolant systems on space vehicles\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: Atomic force microscopy\nOMAX: Abrasive-fluid jets\nStandard &amp; Poor?s: Credit risk models\nToronto General Hospital: Modeling heart disease\nUnderArmour: Optimizing footwear performance\n\n\nThe Camp and the MPI workshop complement each other and form a comprehensive program of interdisciplinary research, education and training that is unique among US institutions.\n\nThe training that the students receive has substantial intellectual merit.  Beyond learning new skills at the Camp and MPI, the students also discover how to synthesize their existing skills to real-world industrial problems.  Perceiving such interdisciplinary connections will serve the students well, no matter their choice of career.  Problem reports from all camps are posted online, which can serve as an invaluable educational resource for those searching for ways to illustrate how mathematics can be applied to industrial problems.\n\nThe open-ended nature of the MPI problems poses a significant intellectual challenge to team members at all levels.  The depth of analysis required has often formed the basis for further publishable research, and technical reports from all workshop problems are posted online.  The results obtained at the MPI workshop have helped the companies involved to improve their production processes, causing positive effects that ripple throughout the larger economy.\n\nBoth the Camp and MPI are proud of their record of inclusion of women and underrepresented groups, both as participants and mentors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Edwards"
