 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rudimentary programming skills are essential to developing fundamental proficiency in computer\r\nscience. However, learning programming techniques can be challenging and frustrating for many\r\nstudents. Without interventions to curb these frustrations, introductory computer science courses will\r\nsuffer from attrition and poor retention rates will follow. Drill-and-practice tools are emerging to help\r\nstudents develop basic programming techniques and improve their confidence. However, there are\r\ncurrently no programming practice systems that actively and adaptively assist students when they\r\nrequire help on exercises. Likewise, the potential for peer learning is currently untapped without\r\neffectively leveraging online, social collaboration in practice tools.\r\n\r\nThe novel approach to organically refine learning materials also offers broader implications for using\r\nautomatic assessment in social eLearning environments. We will study students? behaviors with the\r\nsystem and objectively measure their outcomes. Consequently, our research will offer results associated\r\nwith a framework for supporting social and adaptive drill-and-practice. Overall, we expect to improve\r\nstudent performance and retention in computer science while contributing to the evolution of instructional\r\ntechnology.",
