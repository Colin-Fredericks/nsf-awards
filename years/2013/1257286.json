 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals produce alarm calls in response to danger.  Recent research suggests that these important calls contain a previously-unsuspected amount of information about the specific type of danger (e.g. predator on the ground, hawk perched, flying hawk, threat level).  In addition, it now appears that many different species of birds and mammals participate in complex communication networks that function as \"distant early warning\" systems about shared threats. This research project will focus on how distant early warning systems of animals work.  The project will develop arrays of extremely sensitive microphones so that the acoustic landscapes of natural habitats can be monitored.  The researchers will introduce live hawks of different types and extremely realistic robotic predators into the experimental habitats.  This research will generate important information about natural distant early warning systems:  How fast and how far do alarm calls spread in natural landscapes?  How is information about threat type and threat level encoded in the alarm calls?  Do all species of birds and mammals participate equally in these communication networks?  In addition to novel information on how natural distant early warning systems work, this innovative project will generate new analytical tools for dealing with complex data about how information spreads in space and time.  Resources generated during the project will be made freely available through the Macaulay Library (the world's largest repository of natural sounds) at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology (http://macaulaylibrary.org). This project will also include a large component of cross-training and mentoring of students in many STEM fields.  In addition, the project will dovetail into the well-developed existing infrastructure for public education through Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology Outreach program, The University of Montana's SpectrUM (an interactive science center), The Montana Natural History Center, and several other activities.  Together these activities will reach many thousands of people per year.",

But how do species communicate vital information about a predatory threat, and how is that information interpreted? One hypothesis for a prey assessing risk of a predator is based on the allometric hypothesis, where predators that are more closely matched in size to their prey will be the greatest threat to those prey. In other words, small raptors can be more dangerous to small prey species than to larger prey species and vice versa. We were interested in understanding what information does a differently-sized species receive, and how is that information interpreted. Is a prey-bird&rsquo;s response appropriate for their differently-perceived threat? (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>To test how birds encode information about predators in their alarm calls, we used robotic raptors to elicit high- and low- threat alarm calls from Black-Capped Chickadees (<em>Poecile atricapillus</em>), Blue Jays (<em>Cyanocitta cristata</em>), and Steller&rsquo;s Jays (<em>Cyanocitta stelleri</em>) (Figure 2). The robotic raptors represented large- and small-bodied predators, with Northern Goshawk and Northern Pygmy owl in the western community and Great-Horned owl and Eastern Screech owl in the eastern community. We recorded the acoustic response and then measured the number of alarm response calls and the number of elements within each call for each species (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Each species of chickadee and jays responds, but they respond differently in call rate and call structure for different threat levels. There were no differences in the number of chickadee calls or number of D-notes in the calls in response to small or large predators, but chickadees gave more chickadee calls in response to northern goshawk than to great-horned owl models (Figure 4). The eastern chickadee population give more D-only calls than the western population (Figure 5). Both species of jays responded with more calls to the larger raptors and very little to the smaller raptors (Figure 6); both jays had more call elements in their calls in response to the larger predator than to the smaller predator.</p>\n<p>We concluded that our results do not support the allometric risk hypothesis: the predator size does not explain the response of the chickadees and jays. Likely, there is additional information that birds are responding to, such as the predator&rsquo;s hunting strategy, subtle behavioral cues not replicated by a robot, and avian community composition. Additionally, the difference in call structures between eastern chickadees and western chickadees suggest that there may be regional differences that we have not accounted for in our study. Birds are not simply responding to how big a predator is. There are likely multiple factors that play a role in a prey bird&rsquo;s response to a predator, and most likely it&rsquo;s a multi-modal system of information that prey birds evaluate in their response.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To test how birds decode the alarm calls of other birdss, we used microphone arrays to localize sounds.&nbsp; We played back high threat and low threat alarm calls and recorded the acoustic responses in the experimental area.&nbsp; We were unable to complete our analyses, but we have made great strides in advancing the technology by which to create dynamic maps of alarm call communication networks. The field of animal communication will certainly benefit from these technical advances. In the future, we will use such techniques to reveal the spatial and temporal dynamics of how and when prey species respond to different predators and contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n<div></div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Clark</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257286/1257286_10258353_1501868941592_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1257286/1257286_10258353_1501868941592_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
