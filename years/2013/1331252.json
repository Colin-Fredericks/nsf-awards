 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Overview\r\n\r\nThis award is to support a three-day conference on the history of the organization Science for the People (SftP), which was active during the 1970s and 1980s, and its relevance for the interface of science and society today. The conference will bring together veteran members of the organization and other scientists, STS scholars, and students. The conference will include keynote speakers offering SftP and STS perspectives, and panels on the historical and contemporary significance of SftP to issues that the organization addressed in the past and continue to face society today.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe conference will contribute to three areas of growing importance within STS. First, it will support the effort to replace the simplistic understanding of \"science communication\" promoted by mainstream \"public understanding of science\" circles with a more sophisticated analysis that accounts for political, economic, and social power structures. Second, it will provide additional resources for the study of science and political engagement. Third, it will offer a venue for the further exploration of what some STS scholars have termed \"activist-oriented STS,\" an area that has witnessed a number of rigorous and influential contributions recently. A major lasting contribution will be the compilation of written historical narratives by former members of SftP with analysis by STS graduate students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe conference will benefit scientists and students. Scientists will gain exposure to SftP history and STS perspectives, and so they will acquire a better understanding of the social, political, economic, and cultural contexts of the problems they seek to address through their scientific work. Students will encounter in SftP participants successful examples of people who have put their science education to work in ways consistent with their social and political goals. The conference website is already serving to bring members of these groups into productive conversation. After the conference, the website will provide the public with accessible scholarly analysis of the history of SftP, historical materials produced by SftP in text-searchable pdf format, a summary of the conference?s major themes, panel descriptions, and video recordings of the panels.",
