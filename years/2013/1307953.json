The focus will be on understanding global properties of interesting classes of minimal surfaces, e.g., compactness properties. This will be done by studying the geometric structure of elements of the class.  This approach is motivated by far-reaching work of Colding and Minicozzi who characterized the structure of embedded minimal disks.  Their work has been the basis for much recent progress in the field.  The PI will attack these questions primarily by using methods originating in the theory of integrable systems - especially the geometric theory of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Specifically, the PI will develop preliminary work which suggests that many spaces of minimal surfaces possess dynamics which are modeled on the KdV equation. The connection between minimal surfaces and the KdV equation is best understood using language and ideas coming from projective geometry. As such, one over-arching goal of the project is to formalize these observations in the language of projective geometry and to understand the interaction between the dynamics and the geometry of the minimal surfaces.  A near-term goal is to apply the techniques developed to spaces of free-boundary minimal surfaces. These are particularly amenable to the methods and so act as good model spaces. Motivated by work of Meeks, Perez and Ros on properly embedded minimal surfaces of genus-zero, a longer-term goal is to blend this perspective with more established methods in order to answer questions about embedded minimal surfaces of finite genus. Chief among these is the question, raised by Colding and Minicozzi, whether a embedded minimal surface of finite genus which is complete is necessarily properly embedded.\r\n\r\nA minimal surface mathematically models the shape of a soap film spanning a fixed wire frame. This is because, roughly speaking, the \"energy\" of such a film is given by its surface area and so stable configurations are those with least area - i.e., minimal surfaces. As such, the theory of minimal surfaces directly connects to problems arising in physics, chemistry, biology and materials science.  More broadly, minimal surfaces are an important model for many geometric variational problems - that is problems where one seeks to find and study the properties of geometric objects which are optimal in some sense.  In addition to being a fundamental principle in the physical sciences, such variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics.  A specific goal of the project is to understand the relationship between minimal surfaces and the KdV equation - an equation important in fluid dynamics.  In contrast to minimal surfaces, which are static, the KdV equation models a dynamic physical phenomena, namely the motion of certain one-dimensional water waves. The KdV equation possesses many remarkable mathematical properties and is important in other areas of physics, notably in string theory.  The relationship between the KdV equation and the minimal surface equation is poorly understood and any insight the project may shed on this connection should have broad importance both in mathematics and in physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project considered several geometric problems concerning questions about the shapes of surfaces in space. The results are mathematical, but many address questions that first arose from the study of the natural world.  The primary concern of the project was the study of minimal surfaces and of related geometric flows. \n\nMinimal surfaces are surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, as such, can be thought of as mathematical models of soap films.  They have been investigated since at least the seventeenth century, with famous mathematicians such as  Lagrange, Euler and Riemann making important contributions to their theory.  Nevertheless, they remain central objects of study and recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing questions about their properties, with contributions from many mathematicians.\n\nMinimal surfaces have a a dynamic counterpart, called the mean curvature flow (MCF), in which a surface moves in a manner which decreases its surface area as quickly as possible.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear heat equation  which is formally similar to the famous Ricci flow used by Pereleman to solve the Poincare conjecture.  In addition to the the intrinsic mathematical beauty of the MCF, it has important connections to material sciences and to image processing.  Closely linked with the MCF is the recently introduced concept of entropy of a surface.  This quantity measures the complexity of the surface and decreases under the MCF.  \n\nDuring the course of this project, the PI obtained a number of significant results on limiting behavior of families of minimal surfaces, on properties of singularities of the MCF and a new geometric inequality for closed surfaces.  The most significant result was the verification of a conjecture of Colding, Ilmanen, Minicozzi and White that the round two-sphere has the least entropy amongst all closed surfaces.  In addition to solving an important conjecture, this result is significant as there are very few inequalities that hold for all surfaces.  Furthermore, those inequalities that do exist, such as the isoperimetric inequality, have proved to be of fundamental mathematical importance. This result will appear in Inventiones Mathematicae.  \n\n Finally, while supported by this grant, the PI supervised a Ph.D.  student and organized several seminars.\n    \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacob Bernstein"
