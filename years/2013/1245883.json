 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flood modeling and management are crucial areas in sustainable infrastructure planning and disaster mitigation.  Thus is it critical that civil engineering students become familiar with advanced flood visualization and decision-making tools so that they may adequately design sustainable infrastructure for the future.  In this project, Purdue University Calumet is developing laboratory modules using three-dimensional (3-D) simulation models to allow students to interactively explore different flood management scenarios based on real-world data.  The modules are implemented in undergraduate water resources engineering courses in partnership with the University of the District of Columbia, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Kentucky.  Through the 3-D laboratory modules, students are using the simulated flooding scenarios to visualize the field implications and to evaluate flood mitigation options.  The laboratory modules are being evaluated on their effectiveness in aiding students' attainment of specific content-based learning objectives and impact on students' learning process.\r\n\r\nThis project is significant because it incorporates an immersive virtual 3-D environment for students, as well as practitioners and decision makers, to interactively explore flood scenarios and to identify appropriate flood management plans.  This approach integrates traditional flood modeling tools and innovative geospatial approaches, combined with advanced 3-D computational, animation, and visualization techniques to enhance student learning.  Through workshops, presentations, and publications, the modules are being shared with faculty at other institutions, community groups responsible for flood management, and the scientific community more broadly.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough the funding provided by this grant, an interactive 3D application of a specific river system (Little Calumet River System, located in Indiana) created in Unity 3D platform was fine-tuned and developed as a lab module in the Center for Innovation and Visualization Center at Purdue University Northwest.  The 3D lab modules allowed fly-overs into the system to examine different nodes and also enabled the users to investigate model results.  Students can use the keyboard and mouse to move around and fly through the environment to examine details at specific cross sections of interest.  In addition to inundation levels displayed through a time history of hydrographs, visual displays and learning features were included within the module such as street signs for orientation, time controls to examine the flood at different intervals, 3D models of hydraulic controls such as levees, display of a hydrographs for river cross-sections, water flow data, and intuitive interface for examining flooding effects and finding peak values.  Together, these features of the module serve to connect the flood phenomena and its unsteady flow nature to the principles of open channel flow and flood management.\n\nThe 3D lab module was implemented in civil engineering courses at four institutions: Florida Atlantic University (FAU), Purdue University Northwest (PNW) (formerly Purdue University Calumet), University of the District of Columbia (UDC), and University of Kentucky (UK).  A research study was conducted to examine the impact of the interactive 3D lab module on student learning and perceptions of the learning experience.  It was hypothesized that use of the 3D module would benefit student learning, particularly in relation to concepts requiring higher order thinking skills.\n\nA total of 353 undergraduate students enrolled in hydrology/hydraulics courses at three of the institutions (FAU, PNW, UDC) or a fluid mechanics course at the fourth institution (UK) participated in this research project.  Student learning and perceptions of the learning experience were assessed in sections of the courses that did not use the 3D module and compared to those of students in sections of the courses that did use the 3D module. \n\nResults of the study indicated that students in the hydrology/hydraulics courses who used the 3D module demonstrated greater learning gains than students who did not use the 3D module.  More specifically, students who used the 3D module in these courses performed better on questions requiring application of knowledge.  While similar overall learning gains were not demonstrated when the 3D module was implemented in the fluid mechanics course, students who used the module in the fluid mechanics course did perform significantly better on comprehension level questions than their peers who did not use the 3D module.  These initial findings provide some support for the learning benefits possible with integration of 3D simulations into civil engineering courses, especially related to comprehension and application level outcomes.\n\nStudents who use the 3D module had overall favorable perceptions of the related instruction and reported that they enjoyed learning about floodplain analysis more than students who did not use the 3D module.  Consistent with the demonstrated learning gains, the majority of students who used the 3D module reported that use of the module enhanced their learning and helped them to link new knowledge with previous knowledge.  The majority indicated that they would like the opportunity to use 3D technology to learn about other topics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chandramouli Viswanathan"
