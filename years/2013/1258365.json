 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will characterize the large spatial and temporal variability in the terrestrial fluxes of methyl halides and C2-C4 alkenes into the atmosphere. Field studies will be conducted to quantify ecosystem net fluxes from high emitting peatland pasture (Sherman Island) and temperate forest (Manitou Forest) ecosystems. The hypothesis that methyl halide and light alkene emissions from terrestrial ecosystems are predominantly biogenic and are strongly coupled to each other through the production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) will be investigated. The results of the study will be incorporated into a regional and global emissions model that takes into account biological, physical and chemical driving factors of terrestrial biogenic emissions to the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nMethyl halides impact stratospheric ozone depletion, and light alkenes contribute to tropospheric ozone production. The biogenic emissions of these compounds, from sources such as plants, are a major contributor to organic aerosols that also affect air quality and climate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project tested our hypotheses regarding the production and temporal variability of methyl halides and C2-C4 alkenes from terrestrial ecosystems.   These compounds have major biogenic sources and are important for stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, respectively.  Experiments and field campaigns measured terrestrial emissions of these compounds on several spatial and temporal scales, using a combination of approaches: A) surface flux chamber and branch chamber measurements; B) relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) methods to quantify ecosystem scale net fluxes; and C) incorporation into a model of terrestrial emissions based on an improved understanding of the biological, physical and chemical drivers for these compounds.   The initial instrumental development stage was followed by three extended field deployments (in the Rocky Mountains, at a coastal site, and at an agricultural greenhouse/field) and a modeling component. \n\nKey findings include:  1) emission rates of light alkenes were 40-80% larger than modeled estimates for coniferous forests, and these emissions have broad temporal patterns mirrored by sunlight, temperature and water vapor fluxes; 2) emission rates of methyl halides from a brackish tidal marsh strongly followed the temperature and halophyte growth cycle, with episodic spikes during heat waves; and 3) emissions of methyl halides over the entire growth cycle of agricultural rapeseed crop are lower than previously believed.

It involved a partnership between University of California at Berkeley, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the NOAA Chemical Sciences Division in Colorado.  12 conference presentations and at least 5 peer-reviewed publications resulted from this research.  The research will be expanded more broadly through the incorporation in the biogenic gas emissions models.  Outreach efforts included co-teaching a Communicating Climate Science course, hands-on science demonstrations at Cal Day (the UC Berkeley open house), and public school presentations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Rhew"
