 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive catalog of nearby young stellar objects fully accessible to the astronomical community.  At present, data regarding the approximately 10,000 - 30,000 young stellar objects within ~800pc of the Sun are scattered throughout various archives and the published literature.  These include stars in young clusters, associations, and molecular clouds, with photometric/spectroscopic data in one or more of the following wavelengths:  x-ray, optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-millimeter/millimeter.  In addition, derived quantities such as stellar parameters, angular momentum indicators, activity measures, circumstellar disk diagnostics, etc. are also available through various resources. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide targeted and flexible access to basic data products, as well as higher level data products that are relevant to young stars through a relational database populated with data from all known or suspected members of the population.  The database will also have broad educational value useful to a wide spectrum of users from teachers in the classroom to experienced scientific researchers.",
