 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on integrating M-ary distributed detection and \r\ncommunications, and makes a significant impact on the theory and \r\npractice of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and cognitive radio networks \r\n(CRNs). In particular, the following four problems are tackled.\r\n\r\n(1) M-ary distributed detection: The PI develops fusion rules and local \r\ndecision rules for M-ary distributed detection systems with different \r\nwireless channel models, and studies how the erroneous channels \r\nfundamentally limit the performance of these systems. Furthermore, two \r\ncomposite M-ary distributed detection problems that have applications in \r\nWSNs and CRNs are investigated: joint detection and localization of \r\nmultiple acoustic sources and spectrum sensing in a multi-channel \r\nsystem. (2) Sequential methods for wireless distributed detection \r\nsystems: Striving to gain a profound understanding of the tradeoffs \r\nbetween static and sequential distributed detection in wireless \r\nnetworks, the PI designs two sequential distributed detection systems \r\nwith i) sequential tests only at the sensors and ii) sequential test \r\nonly at the fusion center, and studies how the detection reliability and \r\ndelay of static and sequential detection systems are affected by the \r\nadopted wireless channel model. (3) Impact of imperfect channel state \r\ninformation on the performance of wireless distributed detection \r\nsystems: The PI studies the effects of channel estimation errors on the \r\ndesigns of static and sequential distributed detection systems and \r\ninvestigates how these errors further limit the system detection \r\nperformance. (4) Cooperation in wireless distributed detection systems: \r\nFor both static and sequential distributed detection systems cooperative \r\nschemes are developed, based on local information passing among \r\nneighboring nodes, and conditions under which cooperation provides gain, \r\nin terms of both detection reliability and delay, are explored and the \r\nrelationships between the cooperative gain and different channel models \r\nare sought.",
