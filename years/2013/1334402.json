 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on mechanical micromachining by providing a new framework for accurate prediction of three-dimensional dynamic response at the tool tip. The research objective is to gain fundamental understanding on tool-tip dynamics by combining experimentally-determined spindle dynamics, accurate models of rotating micro-tool dynamics, and the non-ideal motions arising from the spindle and tool-attachment errors.  The specific research approach involves (1) the use of specialized dynamic testing methods for experimental modeling of spindle dynamics, (2) the use of three-dimensional linear elasticity techniques to model dynamics of rotating micro-tools, and (3) the use of laser interferometry to measure error motions of ultra-high-speed spindles. Subsequently, the models for spindle and tool dynamics and error motions are integrated to obtain tool-tip dynamics. The research will also involve experimental validation of the combined tool-tip dynamics predictions for different micro-tools and under different operating conditions. The educational objectives include enhancing the existing manufacturing curricula, and attracting students to manufacturing through pre-college outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe research will offer a comprehensive modeling capability for predicting dynamic behavior at the tool tip when using ultra-high-speed spindles, and will thereby facilitate fabrication of parts with precise micro-scale features in a predictable and efficient fashion from metals, polymers, and composites. Such parts are in high demand from many industries, such as medical and energy-conversion devices. Although micromachining technology has come a long way in the last few years, a wide-range industrial adoption has not yet been realized. One of the main reasons is the lack of thorough understanding on process characteristics, specifically process mechanics and dynamics. This project will provide an effective approach for characterization and predictable utilization of micromachining processes. The industrial relevance of the project will be ensured through our collaboration with two leading spindle companies, which will enable rapid transfer of research findings to industry, and thus, will positively impact advanced manufacturing efforts in the United States.",
