 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Interactions between Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry\"  conference will be held at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, October 20-21, 2012, as a special edition of the Route 81 conference series that has rotated annually among Cornell University, Queen's University, and Syracuse University for over two decades. This conference will bring together leading experts, young researchers, recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry from across the United States and Canada and from around the world. The topics of focus are secant varieties, properties of fat points, and homological invariants.\r\n\r\nThe conference will highlight many aspects of the strong interplay that exists between Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra in the focus areas mentioned above, enabling participants to gain a better understanding of current research and recent advances on these topics. By providing travel and lodging support for US-based participants, this grant will promote the career development of graduate students and early career researchers from the US by bringing them into contact both with peers and with leading experts from the US, Canada and abroad, in an exciting atmosphere of intellectual engagement designed to stimulate the exchange of ideas and to foster research collaborations among the participants. Further details and contact information for the conference organizers can be obtained from the conference web site at http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~ggsmith/Route81/index.html",
