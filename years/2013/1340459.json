Successful design solutions must be practical in the cultural context in which\r\nthey will be used. While all engineering students are not able to participate in a substantial\r\ncultural immersion experience, a clear understanding of how these skills develop, the\r\nchallenges students face, and how design ethnography affects later stages of design will\r\nfacilitate the development and integration of these techniques into engineering design courses\r\nas well as the development of validated metrics to evaluate proficiency in design ethnography.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this research is to provide undergraduate engineering students with\r\npedagogy, curricula, and experiences that teach them ethnographic and co-creation skills. The\r\nresult will be design solutions that better address user needs for emerging global technological\r\nchallenges. The ability of engineers to conduct ethnographic studies and use the data to make\r\neffective design decisions will facilitate the development of innovative, practical, and\r\nimplementable solutions that address this century?s global challenges.",
