Our objective is the extension of clean and efficient low temperature combustion (LTC) technology to operate over the full load and speed range required of an engine.  Two main two technology paths are explored: 1) partial fuel stratification (PFS) in LTC compression ignition engines, and 2) microwave assisted spark plugs (\u00b5WASP) combined with PFS in spark-ignited engines.  This program has significant collaboration with the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories,  the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Ricardo Inc. ( for automotive testing ), and the Clean Combustion Research Center of KAUST.\r\n\r\nOn a fundamental level, this program will provide detailed understanding of the chemical kinetics that cause pressure-sensitive intermediate temperature heat release and equivalence ratio sensitivity in gasoline, phenomena that enable high load boosted LTC with PFS. For the \u00ecWASP technology, this program will provide understanding of the interactions between the spark discharge, the microwave field and the stratified mixture in the flame kernel formation process.  Additionally, the fundamental physics behind flame propagation through a stratified charge will be studied to obtain a comprehensive description of the PFS ignition process.  These scientific insights will be applied, through fundamentally based phenomenological models, to engines for improving engine efficiency and lowering emissions.",
