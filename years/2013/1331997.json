Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\r\nThe Physical Internet (PI) is envisioned as a transformative, open, global, intermodal logistics system that utilizes standard, modular, reusable containers, real-time identification, and routing through shared logistics facilities. In the proposed research, the PIs focus on two aspects of operations: (1) algorithms for container-level processes so as to build loads in the PI and handle these loads at intermodal interfaces; and (2) algorithms for system-level processes so as to route, schedule and coordinate loads that flow through the PI. CELDi is in a unique position to advance the PI for a sustainable logistics future. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of freight transportation systems. Direct benefits to member organizations include access to the algorithms and operational insights developed as part of this research. Other direct benefits are likely to result as data from member organizations are used to test the algorithms through insights into their data and potential operational improvements. Member organizations will have early access to the results of the research. Indirect benefits include enhancing the reputation and attractiveness of CELDi as an organization, which is likely to lead to better retention and recruitment of CELDi members.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe \"Physical Internet\" is envisioned as a transformative, open, global, intermodal logistics system that utilizes real-time control to route standard, modular, reusable containers through shared logistics facilities.  Prior research has established the substantial potential gains in logistics system cost and efficiency that would result from implementation of the Physical Internet.  The primary focus of this project was addressing operational issues associated with implementation of the Physical Internet concept.  Much of the existing research related to the Physical Internet is predicated on the assumption that collaboration is widespread, coordination is effective, and a shared network is available for timely, cost effective, and sustainable freight flow.  In the U.S., unfortunately, evidence suggests that collaboration efforts are more likely to fail than succeed.  On the other hand, collaboration efforts tend to be more widespread and effective in Europe so there is evidence that this idea can be implemented in the right environment.  As such, the team conjectured that collaboration in freight transportation in the U.S. would evolve from the \"bottom-up\" - that is, initiated and driven by market forces and this is a cornerstone assumption of the research. \n\nThis project primarily explored the following key questions related to a future collaborative freight transportation system: \n\nWhat is the current state of practice for collaboration in freight transportation?\nHow much centralized control is necessary to effectively implement this type of system?\nHow should loads be distributed across intermodal and collaborative freight distribution networks?\nWhat are effective designs and operating practices for the Physical Internet intermodal hubs?\nHow should the Physical Internet modular containers be combined in order to form loads to meet volume and weight constraints simultaneously?\n\n\nTo add the perspective of driving our research toward implementable solutions, we established a team of Thought Leaders from the following organizations: Air Liquide, Boeing, CHEP, ES3, Environmental Defense Fund, Geisinger Health System, J.B. Hunt, Kurt Salmon, Millwood, MHI, Navis, P&amp;G, and SC Johnson. \n\nThis research has produced the following significant results:\n\nThe team conducted an extensive literature survey to ascertain the current state of research with respect to collaboration in freight transportation, with an emphasis on horizontal collaboration.  The team also conducted informal and unstructured surveys with our Thought Leaders and other industry representative to determine the current state of practice for horizontal collaboration.\nCollaborative warehousing (i.e., collaboration at the intermodal interfaces) is emerging as an increasingly important component of a system that implements concepts of the Physical Internet.  The accompanying decentralized control will add significant operational burdens on these facilities.  Models were developed to quantify the \"price of anarchy\" in a collaborative warehouse with decentralized operational control.  Centralized and decentralized models of a multi-supplier setting were used to bound the ratio of the cost of decentralized to centralized operation and explore how system parameters impact this ratio.\nA time extended mathematical model that captures freight flow through distribution networks was developed to capture temporal network demands (e.g. deadlines) in addition to traditional freight flow characteristics.  The team solved small instances of the problems using commercial mixed-integer solvers and developed effective heuristic approaches for larger instances.  The model and solution approaches were used to evaluate the benefits of collaboration among transportation service providers.  \nThe relationships between key intermodal hub design elements and operational characteristics were experimentally explored Among the important results was the observation that efficiency is improved as storage space is added up to a certain level but above this level performance actually decreases.\nAlgorithms for packing m-boxes with size and arrival uncertainty have been developed.  Worst-case utilization efficiencies of 80+% are attainable.\n\n\nThis research has advanced our understanding of topics that could ultimately make a broader impact on society by leading to significantly more efficient, sustainable, and effective logistics networks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip M Kaminsky"
