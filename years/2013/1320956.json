 "awd_abstract_narration": "When humans \"recognize\" things one of answers can always be \"unknown\" or \"that's new.\"  Existing vision and machine learning research has made great progress but have done so in a closed set paradigm - which explicitly minimizes risk/errors over what is known.  As a computer vision system is moved toward real problems, it must face up to an open world. This project develops technologies for a new fundamental theory of \"open vision\" and corresponding set of tools that are explicitly designed to address open set recognition. At the heart of this research are three key concepts: 1) extending classical learning theory to include the risks of labeling open/unknown spaces, and then building classifiers that balance empirical risk, smoothness and open space risk; 2) meta-recognition - bringing a statistically-grounded probabilistic interpretation to classifiers, improving their ability to produce \"confidence\" in their answers; 3) operational adaptation - developing new approaches to address, at operation/run time, missing data or new data incorporating both open set and meta-recognition technologies. The work is also developing new approaches for open set evaluation, addressing problems in face recognition and visual object recognition as well as adapting classical machine learning datasets.\r\n\r\nThe open vision paradigm is embodied in open source tools that provide  performance at or significantly advancing the state of the art  while providing greater protection form unknown unknowns.   Since most science is exploring the unknown, providing easy to use open source learning/recognition tools design for both known and unknown data, the project have broad impact to many different applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTraditional machine learning, both statistical and deep network-based, assume all inputs would fall into one of the training classes.  In real systems, it is almost always possible for something unexpected to show up.  While traditional systems would choose one of the known classes, an open-set recognition system would be able to label the unknown inputs as unknown.  For example, one would probably want an autonomous car to stop when an unknown object was in front of it.  Unfortunately, one cannot train a system with all possible unknown objects; there will always be unknown unknowns not seed during training. \n\n\nThe Intellectual merit of the OpenVision project was formalizing the concept of open set recognition problems where the system must learn to label as unknown inputs that were not seen in training and should have bounded error for the space of unknown objects.  The effort develop new approaches to machine learning and vision systems that formally bound the potential error from unknown inputs, developing extensions for traditional SVM-based and deep-network approaches to the problem.   It was the first research to show how deep networks could formally have bounded error in \"rejecting\" unknown inputs.  The OpenVision effort pioneered the use of statistical extreme value theory in vision, and our novel extreme value machine used it to develop a new way of looking at \"margins\" in machine learning, see the associated figure.  In that figure, we show 2D features for examples from four classes and the associated extreme value response.
