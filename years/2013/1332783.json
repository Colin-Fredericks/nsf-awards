Dr. Nocera and his students will investigate the development of catalysts for the photochemical activation of small molecules, including water and hydrogen halides, useful in the generation of solar fuels. The focus of the research is on the expansion of the reactivity of metal complexes to include multi-electron transfer processes for the activation of small molecules relevant to solar fuel production.  A combination of synthetic, spectroscopic characterization, and photocatalytic cycle development studies will be pursued.  The fundamental understanding resulting from this research will enable the development of solar based renewable energy schemes.  Students will be trained in the fundamental science and the public issues relevant to these renewable energy questions.  Outreach to the public forms a large part of the work of this research group.",
