 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research study examines the extent and ways in which the first three Cohorts of MSP Partnership projects have sustained the accomplishments made during their respective grant periods. The study addresses two interrelated research questions: 1) What strategies did the initial cohorts of MSPs use to sustain and nurture their outcomes beyond their NSF award? and 2) What were the mediators that either facilitated or hindered projects' efforts to sustain these outcomes? Guided by a logic model that lays out a proposed theory of sustainability, the study uses a mixed method approach to investigate factors influencing those changes at both school district and Institution of Higher Education (IHE) levels. The study is conducted in two phases: Phase 1 involves document review, discussions with current and former NSF project officers, and interviews with PIs and Co-PIs to provide a broad brush examination of project sustainability. Phase 2 includes case studies in a sample of projects to provide a fuller assessment of facilitators and hindrances.  The specific approach for each case study will depend on the type of practice being sustained and the partners and participants involved in the practice.",

To address this challenge, multiple agencies and organizations have invested heavily in innovative strategies to improve instructional practices, teacher education and professional development, classroom curricula, and educational policies across all grade levels and disciplinary subjects. While these investments frequently support the development, implementation, refinement, expansion, and dissemination of these strategies, they often do not address issues associated with sustainability. Furthermore, the factors that mediate the sustainability of successful educational initiatives are complex and not well understood.\n\nThe research supported by this grant aimed to shed light on this complex picture of sustainability by using the experiences of the National Science Foundation?s (NSF) Math and Science Partnership (MSP) Program. The program awards competitive grants to teams of institutions of higher education (IHEs), local K&ndash;12 school systems, and other supporting partners with a stake in educational excellence. The collaborative work developed as a result of the partnerships across these organizations is designed to enhance the performance of K&ndash;12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our research also examined factors that facilitated and hindered the sustainability of partnerships and components across 27 early cohort MSP projects (with a more intense focus on 9 MSP projects that participated in case studies). The results provide important insights into the conditions surrounding the sustainability of STEM education reform efforts. Key findings are summarized below.\n\nEvidence of component sustainability was present across many early cohort MSP case study projects. We considered an activity associated with a given component as having been sustained if it was continued as originally designed and/or implemented with some minor modifications to (1) content (e.g., there was a change in content focus, audience, or recipient type or activity reach); (2) partners responsible for designing, developing, or delivering the activity; (3) project audience or recipient; and/or (4) project scope (i.e., expanded or reduced). Using these criteria, we found that most of the activities that case study projects had in place at the K&ndash;12 level at the end of their MSP grant were sustained at the time of our site visits\n\nRobust partnerships, while essential to the original implementation of the reform activity, were typically not in place after NSF grant funding had ended. By nature of the program requirements, all MSPs included some form of partnership between IHEs and local school districts. If we take as our working definition that a partnership is judged as \"sustained\" if at least one IHE and one district continue a relationship, seven of the nine cases met this criteria. However, if we raise the bar and set the standard as some critical mass of ongoing collaboration, many of the case study sites fell short (primarily because of the diminished role of IHEs in these projects). As such, the dynamic interaction of partners in identifying and solving problems often did not persist once grant funding ended. This finding reveals that, however important STEM faculty were in designing and delivering original MSP content, the sustained version of their efforts was often informed and implemented without their continued input.\n\nContext plays a significant role in sustainability. A primary takeaway of our research is that local context makes a difference; a range of conditions, both within and beyond the control of the partners, affected what remained at the K&ndash;12 level at the time of our site visits. Further, our work suggests that both existing conditions in the sites (e.g., mediators in our logic model) and the actions taken to sustain the MSPs need to be considered in understanding why the MSPs have left different footprints 5-10 years after their grant funding ended.\n\nPerceived benefits and turnover were especially influential mediators. Two mediators emerged as being especially important&mdash;perceptions of benefit and turnover. On the one hand, the perception of benefits is a very strong driver of sustainability. If the work was viewed positively by the participants, and they perceived benefits for their students and themselves, then ways of sustaining the work were more likely to be found. On the other hand, turnover&mdash;both at the grass-tops and grassroots&mdash;was a powerful hindrance to sustainability.\n\nAdapting activities and securing resources were necessary actions to take for sustainability. In a number of cases, the adaptation or modification of activities was driven by the fact that the original MSP model was too resource intensive to maintain without additional funding from external sources.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joy Frechtling"
