 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jianhua Ren of the University of the Pacific and her graduate and undergraduate research students are investigating the conformational effects on the gas-phase acidities of important biopolymers.  Specifically, Prof. Ren and her group will: (1)  Construct quantitative correlations between the gas-phase acidities and the conformations of a large number of peptides, including peptides containing unnatural amino acids; (2) investigate the effects on the gas-phase acidities of peptides containing D-amino acids; and (3) examine the helix conformational effects on the gas-phase acidities of peptoid polymers.  Prof. Ren and her researchers will carry out these studies using a variety of mass-spectrometry methods.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the work by Professor Ren and her group is to develop better models for understanding the acid-base properties of proteins.  The acid-base properties of proteins have a profound impact on the reactivity of proteins (enzymes), and the overall acidity of peptide groups in a protein are influenced by a myriad of subtle electrostatic effects.  Dr. Ren is trying to unravel the relative contributions of these subtle effects.   Along the way, Prof. Ren will train a very large number of undergraduate and graduate (MS) student researchers in the important area of biological mass spectrometry, after which they will enter the technological and medical workforce.",
