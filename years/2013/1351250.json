The WRF is a widely used meteorological mesoscale model that has been used to simulate a large variety of meteorological phenomena.  In collaboration with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) of the Department of the Interior, NCAR scientist will be modified to accurately simulate the atmosphere, especially boundary layer processes over the ocean and in coastal areas.  The scientist will utilize data and results from completed BOEM studies to help improve model physics and for model validation.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research will result in an improved version of the WRF that will be of benefit to the research community.  It alos will provide the BOEM with a valable tool for understainding the atmosphere and air quality in the marine and coastal environment.",
