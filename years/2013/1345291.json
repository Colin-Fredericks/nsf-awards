 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are critically important in maintaining a healthy pipeline of domestic graduate students in computer science and related fields. These early research experiences are often formative for their participants, giving them both an understanding of the research enterprise and the confidence required to consider a research career. In addition, REUs provide valuable skills and long-term mentoring relationships that are likely to contribute to personal satisfaction and success in graduate school.  The current demand for REU opportunities exceeds the supply.  The goal of this proposal is to increase the supply of REU opportunities by offering encouragement, resources, and support to research-active faculty members. This award will fund four short workshops on undergraduate research at major research conferences over the next two years.  The conferences will be chosen to represent a broad cross section of areas covered by the CISE Directorate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the development and implementation of workshops on best practices in engaging undergraduates in computer science research.  The project was motivated by the observation that there are a number of factors that serve to discourage undergraduate research.  These include a very busy professoriate due to rapidly increasing enrollments in computer science, reduced interest in research by undergraduates due to the high availability of software development internships, among others.  As a result, the pipeline of domestic students going on to graduate school is fragile and creates a risk for our national competitiveness in computing research.\n\nWe developed and offered workshops for current and future computer science faculty members on effective methods for engaging undergraduates in research.  These workshops were held at seven major computing research conferences.  The presenters were the PIs and colleagues on the Computing Research Association's Education Committee (CRA-E).  Participants at these workshops were senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty members. \n\nThe workshops described a number of best practices such as techniques for identifying research problems appropriate for undergraduates, recruiting and selecting undergraduate research students, setting appropriate expectations, mentoring, logistics of developing an undergraduate research program, co-curricular programs, and others.  In addition, each workshop was designed to facilitate discussion among the participants and to help build communities of research mentors who could continue to support one another.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ran Libeskind-Hadas"
