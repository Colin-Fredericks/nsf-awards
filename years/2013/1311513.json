 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid evolutionary radiations allow tremendous insights into speciation and biogeographic history.  However, reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in such radiations has often been challenging owing largely to short periods of time between lineage-splitting events.  Preliminary simulations show that using DNA sequence data from hundreds of gene regions helps improve estimates of genealogical relationships between species in rapid radiations.  This study aims to resolve relationships within the bird family Zosteropidae, a group characterized by the fastest speciation rate known among land vertebrates.  Investigators will use next generation sequencing technology to collect DNA sequence data from hundreds of genomic regions to illuminate evolutionary relationships among members of the family.\r\nResolution of genealogic relationships within Zosteropidae is vital to opening novel research avenues in historical biogeography across several archipelagos in the Old World.  More broadly, this research can provide methodological insights into paths toward resolving relationships in other rapid evolutionary radiations.  This study provides an excellent training opportunity for undergraduate students supported by KU?s Office of Diversity in Science Training.  Through this project the investigators will help prepare undergraduates from underrepresented groups for careers in science through mentoring in collecting and analyzing data, as well as in presenting and publishing research.",
