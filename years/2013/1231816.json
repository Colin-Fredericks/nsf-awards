 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approach:  The research objective is to develop a novel energy harvesting method for self-powered devices. If one could develop sensing circuits that required no power, then the amount of wiring which leads directly to maintenance and production costs could be greatly reduced. It is proposed to develop energy harvesters to create sensor networks that could constantly report on the health of a variety of critical structures. The proposed approach will develop methods of power harvesting from fluid flow using aeroelastic systems and smart power electronic circuits.  Using piezoelectric structures, these devices will be capable of converting flow-induced vibrations into storable electrical energy. Nonlinear switching circuits will be developed to enhance the efficiency of transducer electromechanical power extraction.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This work also represents fundamental research into a heretofore untapped source of energy for self-powered systems, i.e., the movement of fluid  air and water. The results of this work will give engineers the analytical tools to determine how to harvest power from fluid flows. This could aid in the development of condition-based systems of maintenance for future and existing infrastructures.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: This project will disseminate information for K-12 students by creating teaching modules in cooperation with local middle and high school teachers. These modules will be made available to schools on the web to demonstrate the idea of energy harvesting from the environment. Local teachers will be invited to a workshop at Cornell with their students to help create lessons and experiments for use in K-12 classrooms.",

This was achieved by using a combination of cubes and cylinders (roughness elements) mounted to the floor of the wind tunnel upstream of the building being tested. Measurements of the mean wind speed enhancement and turbulence characteristics were made at three locations along the roof top of the building being tested: at the leading edge, a middle location, and trailing end of the roof top. Comparisons were made to a base case, a rectangular building model. All facade modifications (sloped, elliptical and rose shaped configurations) caused an increase in the mean wind speed directly above the roof in addition to a decrease in the turbulence intensities at the middle location and trailing end, demonstrating building facade modifications can be used to increase the availability of wind energy at building roof tops.

A novel torque transducer calibration was developed that increased the accuracy of our model turbine power generation measurements by a factor of five or more driving the uncertainty in our measurements down to about 2%. A single turbine experiment that compared a turbine in steady optimal operation compared to unsteady suboptimal operation demonstrated accelerated turbine wake decay, a sign of enhanced vertical mixing of wind energy from above down into the wake, an indicator of potential improved turbine array performance.
