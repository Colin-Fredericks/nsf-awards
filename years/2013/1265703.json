 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a project entitled \"Metal-Catalyzed Diradical Reactivity: From Fundamental Thermal- and Photo-Chemistry to Novel Nanomaterials,\" the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program supports Professor Jeffrey M. Zaleski at Indiana University to probe the geometric and electronic factors that control metal-catalyzed and photochemical diradical generation by the Bergman cyclization. Three primary structure types are investigated: 1) combined sigma/pi complexes where activation is geometrically controlled through the sigma bonds and electronically via the pi-system.  Structures in this theme examination of catalytic Bergman vs. Myers-Saito cyclization pathways that are important to radical-mediated chemical transformations; 2) construction of large chromophoric assemblies that use thermal and photochemical Bergman cyclizations to fuse ring systems catalytically to form optically responsive molecules; and 3) incorporation of these reactive ligand sets into large nanoassemblies that can be activated to form all carbon frameworks by template vaporization.  These three architectural classes carry both a fundamental research question to be addressed as well as a potential broader impact from the final architectures and reactions.  Thermal reaction pathways are evaluated using standard synthetic methodology such as NMR, crystallography, and spectroscopic characterization of reaction intermediates.  Optical properties of chromophoric products are examined using nanosecond and ultrafast lifetime and transient absorption methods, while characterization of nanoarchitectures is conducted mainly using electron microscopy.\r\n\r\nThis research impacts chemical catalysis methodology for constructing new molecules using metal/radical mediated reactions, which is a fundamental need in the chemical community.  The chromophore assembly component of the work builds new constructs that can be used as chemical sensors, or for light harvesting in solar energy conversion.  The nanomaterial aspect of the project generates reactions on nanoscale surfaces to create new, higher-order assemblies that have potential applications in molecular electronics and ultralight pure carbon electronic arrays.  From an educational perspective, the research helps to train students in a combined fundamental science/application approach to chemistry that spans synthesis and high-tech measurements.  Students at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral, including those from underrepresented minorities programs at IU, benefit from exposure to a range of research challenges and diversities of solution.  Some of the work is outreached to local schools to entice young minds to pursue degrees in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe chemical properties and transformation of molecules is at the heart of everything from fuels to detergents to pharmaceuticals and even fabrics and plastics.  Understanding specific behavior of these compounds and how they are made is fundamental to developing new ways to make novel chemical species with unique properties.  One of the approaches is to use reactive subunits of molecules and catalysts with unique structures to control reactions to generate desired outcomes.  It is especially valuable to control highly energetic reactions to give specific products, or transform waste molecules into useful new species.  This overall process requires intelligent design of chemical reactions so the desired outcome can be achieved without side reactions.  Toward these goals, our project has developed several new constructs that either poise a highly reactive molecule at just the appropriate structure to control its chemical outcome, or built very tiny sites where waste molecules such as carbon dioxide can react and be turned into other compounds to be used as fuels.  Both of these processes and outcomes are at the cutting edge of the field of chemical preparations and transformations.  Our overarching impact will be measured by the ability to build new chemical constructs with well-defined and controlled reactivity for chemical recycling to maintain a clean planet as well as unusual pharmaceutical candidates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey M Zaleski"
