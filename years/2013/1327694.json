Thin film photovoltaics have demonstrated high\r\nlight-to electricity conversion efficiencies and are leading candidates to provide lower-cost\r\nenergy due to potential advantages in manufacturing and materials costs. The topic has great\r\nimportance for the materials research community to further its contribution to the increased\r\nurgency in the US and globally for developing alternative energy sources. The specific goals\r\nof the symposium are to present and disseminate significant recent advances in the understanding\r\nof these materials and devices and to help develop a diverse and active community including\r\nestablished researchers and young scientists to further technical progress in the future.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe symposium brings together a wide range of experts in research on thin-film photovoltaics\r\nincluding twelve internationally recognized invited speakers along with students and other\r\nyoung scientists. There will be sessions on many different aspects of the technology and\r\na range of different materials needed for production. Synergies between different materials,\r\nprocessing approaches, and characterization methods will be highlighted. This range of technical\r\npresentations along with a symposium organization designed to foster open discussion will\r\nhelp further scientific progress.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe objectives of the symposium target two different impacts. First, the technical content\r\nwill further the potential of thin-film photovoltaics to contribute to US and global energy\r\nand environmental needs. Second, an emphasis on developing a broad, collaborative research\r\ncommunity with a specific focus on the educational development of students and early career\r\nresearchers and their incorporation into this community will help develop the next generation\r\nof scientists needed to meet our research needs.",
