 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is one of the primary communication media for users who are visually impaired. However, the vulnerability of this underserved population of Internet users to various forms of cyber-attacks has deteriorated the effective use of online services offered for general Internet users. The screen reader tools often overwhelm users with visual disability by providing large amounts of text, which may lead those users to ignore that information. An ignored security warning may harm users and make them vulnerable to various forms of cyber-threats. This project translates security cues and warnings into various forms of tones and sounds through sonification. It takes a security cue or warning message and composes the most effective pitch/sound to represent the security warning and conveys the security information to the users who are visually impaired through sounds instead of text verbalized by screen readers. The sonified security warnings undergo extensive usability testing in order to assess the effectiveness of the sonified security cues. The broader impact of this sonification project includes providing a sonification-based technology to alert Internet users who are visually impaired and assist them to make an informed decision when encountering security warnings and to ensure that those security warnings are not overlooked. The sonification-based technology for transforming security warnings to sounds can be integrated to any popular Internet Web browser.",

The study showed that users who are visually impaired use the Internet for various purposes such as fun, checking emails, chatting, social networking, playing online games, online education, shopping, and banking. The majority of the participants (80%) reported feeling &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; or &ldquo;very concerned&rdquo; about cyber security threats. Most participants were concerned about someone stealing private information (70%) or gaining access to financial information (65%), as well as personal information being made public (65%). Fewer participants expressed concerns about the possibility of a computing device getting infected with a virus or malware (35%). Furthermore, it was observed that participants who were more knowledgeable and skilled regarding cybersecurity tended to be more concerned about it and to use the Internet less than those who were less knowledgeable about cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>To accomplish the second goal, a sonification framework was designed. A general approach for designing a user-centric sonification scheme for cyber threats includes identification of: 1) security threats and cues to sonify, 2) the message that must be delivered to the users through sonification, 3) the abstraction level and representation form of the sonification, and 4) the type of sounds (i.e., artificial or natural) to use.&nbsp; &nbsp;The developed framework was utilized to create three candidate sonifications, which were based on natural sounds, for each of three cyber threats.</p>\n<p>1. Phishing: An attacker&rsquo;s attempt to trick users into giving the attacker their private information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sonifications: i) casting a fishing rod, ii) breaking glass, and iii) opening a rusty door.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Malvertising: An attacker&rsquo;s attempt to entice users to download files that contain programs that cause havoc on the user&rsquo;s computer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sonifications: i) dropping a bomb, ii) sounding a siren alarm, and iii) pouring water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Form-Filling: A user enters sensitive information into an improper field in an online form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sonifications: i) typing on a keyboard, ii) boiling water, and ii) playing a slot machine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;To accomplish the third goal, the research team developed three Web applications and scenarios, each of which contained a security threat along with the sounds representing the threat. Usability testing occurred in two phases. During Phase 1, the effectiveness, pleasantness, urgency, and conspicuity of each sonification was tested. During Phase 2, the usability of each sonification was tested under realistic conditions. Usability testing was conducted with Internet users who were and were not visually impaired to examine the universality of the sonifications. In general, usability testing showed that sonification of security warnings is highly effective in informing Internet users. The results suggested that it is possible to develop sonified cyber-security threat indicators that users intuitively understand. More specifically, both groups of users (those with and without visual impairments) agreed on the urgency level of the sounds. The groups agreed that breaking glass, sounding a siren, and playing a slot machine convey the most urgency.&nbsp; The groups also agreed on the pleasantness levels of the sonifications. The groups also agreed on ratings of the best sounds created for phishing and form-filling as casting a fishing reel and typing on a keyboard, respectively. The two user groups rated different sounds as the best sounds to represent malware downloading. The users who were visually impaired rated dropping a bomb as the best representative sound for malware downloading; whereas, the participants without visual impairment rated sounding a siren as the best.</p>\n<p>There are some slight variations between the two groups of participants with respect to correctly identifiable sonifications. For instance, 80% of the participants without visual impairment were able to correctly identify casting a fishing reel' as a phishing attack; whereas, only 46% of participants with visual impairment were able to correctly identify this sonification for phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>To accomplish the fourth goal, the research team developed KeepSafe, which is a Google Chrome extension that provides a sonification sandbox. KeepSafe sonifies threats related to malware downloading, various forms of phishing, and form filling. It uses various known heuristics to identify a Website as malicious such as i) the absence of SSL certificates, ii) the number of dots used in a given URL, and ii) the length of the URL.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347521/1347521_10274407_1461680852836_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347521/1347521_10274407_1461680852836_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sonification of Security Attacks/Cues\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347521/1347521_10274407_1461680852836_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sonification of Security Attacks/Cues\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Popular cyber threats targeting users who are visually impaired.
