 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network to offer 7 workshops for faculty at HBCUs. The series includes proposal development workshops for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty at these minority-serving institutions that have never received HBCU-UP support.  Workshops in the series focuses on enhancing the ability of STEM and/or Education faculty at current HBCU-UP grantee institutions to prepare competitive Broadening Participation Research (BPR) and Research Initiation Awards (RIA) proposals to NSF's HBCU-UP program. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project convenes STEM junior faculty from grantee institutions to discuss effective mentoring and training of STEM undergraduates as research assistants.  These workshops are designed to help ensure that students who graduate from HBCU institutions with degrees in STEM disciplines are well-prepared to successfully pursue STEM graduate study or to transition into the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe workshops will involve a minimum of 250 different STEM faculty from HBCUs and provide a strong foundation for institutions to pursue and successfully receive increased support for STEM and STEM education activities on their respective campuses. Strengthening STEM disciplinary offerings at minority-serving institutions represented in the workshop series increases the number and quality of preparation of STEM graduates from these institutions. This, in turn, positions HBCUs to enhance and expand their contribution to the quality and productivity of the Nation?s STEM workforce.",
