These problems all require developing completely new techniques for frame design.  \r\n(1) Fusion frames have a host of applications in distributed processing, wireless sensor networks, and other areas.  The investigator and his students construct fusion frames designed specifically for applications.  \r\n(2) It is now known that the 1959 Kadison-Singer Problem is equivalent to fundamental unsolved problems in a dozen areas of research in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and engineering.  The recent surprising positive solution to the problem raises a number of fundamental questions about the implementation of this result to all these areas of research.  Advances here affect a dozen important research areas in a fundamental way.  \r\n(3) The investigator and his students derive new classes of Grassmannian frames.  These frames have broad application to communication theory, graph theory, and quantum physics -- especially quantum information theory, quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography, and foundational issues in quantum mechanics.  \r\n(4) The investigator attacks the famous Paulsen Problem in frame theory, which has important implications for operator theory and other areas of pure mathematics. \r\n\r\n     The investigator constructs and designs fusion frames for a host of applications to problems in engineering.  One emphasis is on designing wireless sensor networks.  which are an emerging technology with the potential to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons in transport.  Another application is to distributed processing where data systems are too large for central processing.  This overload of data now appears in engineering, physics, astronomy, medicine, biology, and industrial applications that demand real-time processing on as ever-increasing amounts of data.  Frames also have application to a number of important problems in pure mathematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Hilbert space frames have traditionally been used in signal/image\nprocessing.  However, today frame theory is an exciting, dynamic subject with applications to pure mathematics, applied mathematics, engineering, medicine, computer science, quantum information theory, and more; with new applications arising every year.  Problems in frame design arising in applications often present fundamental,\ncompletely new challenges never before encountered in mathematics. \n\n \n\nThe idea of this proposal was to develop applications of Hilbert space frame theory.  In this direction, a new area of research was introduced:  weaving frames, which has application to sensor networks which might randomly sample a signal from different devices. \n\n \n\nIn certain areas of engineering, the phase of a signal can be lost during the processing of a signal.  This occurs in speech recognition, quantum state tomorgraph, x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and much more.  Phase retrieval is an area of research which produces algorithms for recovering this lost phase.  During the term of this grant, an extensive study of phase retrieval was carried out answering a long list of open problems in this field.\n\n \n\nQuantum detection is fundamental to quantum information theory.  In this project, a complete solution of the frame quantum detection problem is given including the quantum injectivity problem and the quantum range analysis problem.  The project solved both the real and complex cases and both the finite and infinite dimensional cases.\n\n \n\nAnother new idea was introduced:  Associating vectors in C^n with rank 2 projections in R^{2n}.  This was a major breakthrough in frame theory and immediately solved 4 longstanding open problems in the field and is being further developed to answer many more problems in the field.\n\n \n\nThere was also an extensive study of biangular and equiangular tight frames.  These frames have application to quantum information theory (quantum computing), coding theory (communications) and compressed sensing (remote sensing). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThree RAs were supported and received extensive training on how to become productive and successful mathematical researchers one day.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter G Casazza"
