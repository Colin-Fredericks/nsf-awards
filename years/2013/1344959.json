The aim of the program is to provide an introduction to this area of research and its most recent developments, to review and disseminate recent progress and to stimulate the emergence of new ideas and directions of research. Some of the activities are aimed specifically at researchers at the beginning of their career and at people who have no prior specific knowledge of this area of research. Other activities are aimed at specialists. Most of the activities will focus on recent developments and new directions of research.  The program's website is available at http://www.ihp.fr/en/ceb/geowalks.",

Weekly seminars were organized including a student seminars. The following mathematicians presented series of lectures:\n \nSteve Lalley, Emmanuel Breuillard, Jean-Francois Quint, Volodymyr Nekrashevych, Yves Benoist, Nikolai Vavilov and Paul Schupp.\n \nThe trimester attracted over 400 participants. The project partially supported 8 US based advanced researchers, 2 US based postdocs and 11 US based students. Supported participants included 8 women and students from all over the United States.  Many US based participants were supported by other means including their individual research Grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laurent Saloff-Coste"
