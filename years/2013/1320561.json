 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project include the design of networked mobile robotic sensor nodes, which are\r\ninspired by insects within the family gerridae, that can monitor water quality in lakes and rivers, and jump\r\nrepeatedly to enhance communication capability to overcome the effect of water on radio signal propagation.\r\nThis work will also develop energy efficient algorithms that carefully select sensor nodes to jump to gain the\r\nbenefit of longer distance communication while managing the energy required to jump. The robotic sensor\r\ncan harvest solar energy in a outdoor environment to maintain long term performance. New methods for\r\nsensor localization as the sensor floats within a lake or river will be developed as well as efficient algorithms to collect sensor data and deliver it to the cyber infrastructure that could be used for hydrology modeling and prediction.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research effort should significantly enhance the capability of networked mobile sensor\r\nsystems for water quality monitoring in response to water pollution or other environmental conditions. These\r\nconcerns can be from oil spills, issues of bacterial levels, or even detection of levels of radiation from nuclear power plant disasters. This research should provide a cost-effective approach for water quality monitoring that can protect health and emergency management such as advising people to vacate areas of environmental damage. Furthermore, new sensor technology should be developed that provides enhanced opportunities for business and job opportunities to industries and society and provides students with a platform to learn and understand all levels of sensor development and operation.",

This design aimed to achieve autonomous jumping from water surface. Once this is accomplished, repetitive jumping can be realized by designing a self-righting mechanism to recover from the posture when the robot falls on the water surface. The second approach is based on the principle of buckling for elastic parts. Specifically, a superelastic wire made from shape memory alloy is hosted in a rectangular part, which will float on water surface. By applying a downward force on the wire, it will snap to the other side to push against the water and jump up. The downward force can be generated from a shape memory alloy coiled actuator.

More specifically, the traffic notification packets are only responsible for notifying nodes on active routes of incoming data packets. The size of a traffic notification packet is minimized and a traffic notification packet is transmitted in a &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; mode to achieve fast traffic notification. In data transmission scheduling phase, a concise representation of channel access schedule is proposed along with a low overhead schedule exchange mechanism. The schedule exchange ensures that time slots are distributed only among nodes that are on active routes and thus the channel utilization is improved in a different way from the slot stealing, providing similar high throughput and low delay with much lower power consumption.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results of this research effort have impact for broad areas of science and society.&nbsp; It proposed a new method for providing a cost-effective approach and a new sensor technology for water quality monitoring that can protect health and enable the better use of public policy when advising people to vacate areas of environmental damage.&nbsp; The project provided students with a platform to learn and understand all levels of sensor development and operation.
