 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoscience information is defined on both discrete and continuous spatial domains. Discrete\r\nspatial domains include point locations of observations at measurement sites and GIS coverages\r\nof point, line and area features used for observation and data interpretation. Continuous\r\nspatial domains are used in geophysical fluid sciences such as for the atmosphere, oceans,\r\nand land subsurface to describe arrays of measured or modeled variables defined on a mesh\r\nof uniformly spaced points. Data defined on either discrete or continuous spatial domains\r\nmay also vary discretely or continuously in time, ranging from one-time samples, to samples\r\nat random points of time, to samples at regularly spaced intervals of time. This project\r\nbuilds upon previous work called \"Crossing the Digital Divide\" focused on integrated discovery\r\nof common information themes including precipitation in discrete data from the CUAHSI hydrologic\r\ninformation system and continuous data from the Unidata THREDDS data server. This project\r\nwill advance that work by investigating in the first year creating new technologies for publishing\r\nand discovery of information through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)\r\nCommon Infrastructure, the definition of a Common Information Model for discrete and continuous\r\ndata, development of shard software tools for using this Common Information Model, and extension\r\nof the concepts to similar information in the Polar, Ocean and Solid Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis work builds on existing NSF data infrastructures and extends them in a reasonable way between two domains, Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, which are closely related intellectually, but have very different data environments. Some\r\nfurther extension into the Polar, Ocean and Solid Earth Sciences is also attainable. The project include the engagement of an international spectrum of collaborators\r\nthrough the Global Earth Observing System of Systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the final phase of this project, the results were applied to a new National Water Model of the United States, which now continually forecasts flow on 2.7 million stream reaches of the continental United States.  Associated with that effort is an Innovators Program at the National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, at which 34 graduate students from 22 universities spent 7 weeks in June-July 2016 conducting research projects to advance the National Water Model.   This project supported 6 of those students.  The National Water Model starts with a forecast of weather and precipitation, transforms these into forecasts of catchment runoff, takes that water and routes it downstream through the nation's stream network, and produces discharge forecasts throughout the continental US.  This is an unprecedented linkage of atmospheric science and hydrology for the United States and elsewhere in the world.   The National Water Model uses the netCDF format to distribute its results from the centralized archive maintained at the NOAA Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputer System, and in order to function correctly, it needs to draw on observations data from flow adn water level networks across the nation.  The WaterML language is the standard by which that information will be ingested.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Maidment"
