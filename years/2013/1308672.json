 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Walter Fast from University of Texas at Austin, and Dr. Dali Liu from Loyola University Chicago, to study enzymes capable of degrading N-acyl-homoserine lactones used in the quorum-sensing (QS) pathways of many Gram-negative bacteria.  Two enzymes, one that uses a metal ion mediated mechanism (AiiA) and a second that uses covalent catalysis (PvdQ), will be investigated to determine how they recognize and process various QS signals.  These enzymes will also be used to probe the QS and quorum-quenching in mixed microbial cultures.  The results of this research will increase the precision of biochemical tools useful in quorum sensing research, will provide catalysts for potential anti-biofouling and anti-infective applications in agri-and aqua-culture, and will advance the understanding of social interactions between diverse bacterial species.\r\n\r\nAlthough bacteria are considered single-celled life, they display coordinated behaviors that are closely linked to how many individual bacteria are present in a given place.  This type of group behavior is called \"quorum-sensing\" because some behaviors do not manifest until a quorum of bacteria is present.  The goal of the proposal is to study proteins that can interfere with cell-to-cell signaling.  This work will generate new catalysts with potential applications as industrial biofouling agents and as anti-infective agents in agri- and aqua-culture.  The research will provide an environment for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in specialized techniques used in the study of protein structure and function.  The project will also be integrated into an outreach program designed to increase the interest and participation in science of K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division of the Biological Sciences (BIO) Directorate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"No man is an island,\" but, what about a bacterium?  Many bacteria behave differently in groups than as individuals, and can coordinate group behavior.  Often such coordination occurs at the detriment of human or animal hosts, when found in pathogenic bacteria, or promotes biofouling through the coordinated production of biofilms.  This project had two broad aims, the first being the study of catalysts that can block communication between bacteria by acting as a sort of molecular radio jamming device, and the second being the training of new scientists for the workforce and reaching out to K-12 students to encourage the curiosity of young scientists.  As an outcome of our efforts, we determined the molecular structures of approximately a dozen different combinations of chemicals similar to those used in bacterial communication and variants of the proteins capable of degrading these signals.

In the completion of this project, we helped to train 5 graduate students, 12 undergraduate students, and two high school students, with almost all continuing to progress in scientific fields.  We also developed an annual public outreach event entitled \"A 3D tour of drugs\" for K-12 students, many from groups underrepresented in scientific fields, and emphasized the basic science that underlies the development of new medicines.  Taken together, the outcomes of this project provide a strong scientific foundation for developing catalysis to probe, manipulate, and block interbacterial communication pathways with possible medical and industrial applications, and also contribute to the strength and diversity of the future scientific workforce.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Walter L Fast"
