Partnering on this project are three institutions: (1) Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE-IAE) since 2003, with a multidisciplinary team of faculty representing expertise in critical infrastructure, computing, engineering, technology, and security; (2) Corning Community College (CCC); and (3) Greater Southern Tier Board of Cooperative Educational Services (GST BOCES), a program for high school students serving 21 schools in New York's Southern Tier counties. \r\n\r\nThe project has four major goals. First, the project develops and embeds a set of flexible CIP course modules, such as labs or teaching components, in existing high school and courses without requiring major course or program modifications. Second, faculty expertise in CIP is developed through cross-disciplinary collaborations within and between the partnering institutions. Third, the developed curricular materials are disseminated through presentations, tutorials, panels and workshops. Finally, project effectiveness is comprehensively assessed using both external and internal evaluators.",
