 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to study a service provider facing an arrival stream of delay-sensitive, strategic customers. The \"type\" of a customer consists of her valuation for service and her delay sensitivity (waiting cost). While the distribution of customer types may be known, or partially known, an individual's customer type is not known. The research approach is to study a continuum of customer valuations (rather than a finite number), enabling the analysis of infinitely many price/delay combinations.  The deliverables of this research will include a revenue-maximizing incentive-compatible menu of prices, where a customer pays a higher price to receive higher queuing priority, and hence lower delay. Additionally the research will deliver modeling and analysis tools and revenue and welfare comparisons under different customer types.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will solve a timely problem: how to allocate and price service priority to customers, where the customers are heterogeneous in their valuations (available funds)and in their delay sensitivities and are willing to lie about these.  The award will produce simple closed-form optimal price menus that charge different prices for different priority levels, so as to optimize profit for the service provider.  The research is made possible by a combination of two very different research areas: incentive-compatible pricing and queuing theory and contributes to a long-term ongoing international collaboration in pricing and queuing between Carnegie Mellon and the TUE/EURANDOM Institute in the Netherlands. The mathematics developed will also help train graduate and undergraduate students as well as Math Olympiad K-12 students in the Western PA ARML team and will contribute to the SWAN program on optimal adoption placement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of our project is to maximize profit by exploiting\nthe fact that disparate users have different delay sensitivities and\nalso different abilities to pay for reducing their delay.  We exploit\nthis by offering different users the ability to pay to receive\npriority in a queue, thereby reducing their delay in the queue.\nOur results are extremely general.  They affect the internet, banks,\nhealthcare, airports and any other situation where people can pay to\nachieve lower delay.\n\nThe first thrust of our project deals with the situation where people\nwith higher valuations (more money) are also more delay sensitive.\nOur idea for maximizing profit under this setting is to offer users a\nmenu of priority/price options.  We find that we can increase profit\nby almost 20% by offering high valuation users higher priorities via\nour optimal priority/price menu.  We also conduct a numerical study\nto understand effect of increasing the number of price options on the\nmenu.  We find that even a small number of menu options goes a long\nway towards maximizing profit.  Finally we consider the case where a\ncustomer's value (money) is not proportional to their delay cost.  It\nturns out that this case is far more difficult, and we are unable to\ndetermine a profit-maximizing menu of options for customers.\n\nIn a second thrust of our work, we are motivated by the case where the\nservice provider is a health-care provider trying to decide how to\nprioritize his/her patients.  We again consider the problem where\npeople with higher valuations (more money) are also more delay\nsensitive, and will pay for less waiting time.  However we assume that\nall customers value \"face-time\" with the doctor, although they dislike\nwaiting time.  Specifically, we assume that the service provider (the\ndoctor) can control his/her speed.  If a service provider chooses to\nserve a customer quickly, that is viewed as degrading the quality of\nservice for that customer because the provider is spending less\n\"face-time\" with the customer.  Our results on this problem are very\ncounter-intuitive.  We find that it is best to serve the\nless-valuable customers first, but serve them quickly.  The more\nvaluable customers should be served later, but be granted much longer\nservice times.  Even in the case where there is only a single customer\nclass, under the profit maximizing policy, not all customers should be\ntreated the same.  Some customers should randomly be given faster\n(low-quality) service with high priority, while others should be given\nslower (high-quality) service with low priority.  There are many\nimplications for this result in healthcare and other discretionary\nservice settings.\n\nIn a third thrust of our project, we consider how dispatching policies\nfor multi-server systems are affected by the fact that customers can\nhave different valuations (money).  We produce the first analysis of\ndispatching policies in multi-server systems where customers have\ndifferent values.  We find that policies based on the c-mu rule are\nactually much worse that expected, and we develop a new suite of\npolicies that route jobs so as to isolate high-value customers from\nothers.  We also evaluate dispatching policies which allow\nhigher-value customers to replicate themselves onto multiple queues.\n\nA fourth thrust of our project deals with the reverse case where the\nservers, rather than the customers, behave strategically.  Here we\nfind that optimal staffing decisions are greatly impacted by the\npresence of strategic behavior.  In fact, the number of servers needed\nfor optimal capacity provisioning is an order of magnitude higher\nwhen servers are strategic than is needed when servers are not\nstrategic.\n\nThis project has several Broader Impact outcomes. The PI, Mor\nHarchol-Balter, runs the Western PA ARML team, which trains 20 high\nschool students for the Math Olympiad.  Funding for the ARML team is\nprovided through Jump Trading.  The PI and her students are also\ninvolved in Women@SCS events.  These include: CMU Tech nights to\nteach technology to middle school girls, Road Shows to attract high\nschool students to computer science, and Women@SCS Creative Technology Nights, to talk to high school girls about research in computer\nscience.  Co-PI Mustafa Akan is heavily involved in the SWAN program,\nPennsylvania's Statewide Adoption and Permanency Network, where he\napplies research from the grant to help pace children.\n\nThe project contributed to the training of several PhD students and\nundergraduates.  PhD student Sherwin Doroudi was partially funded on\nthis grant.  He graduated last year and accepted a tenure-track\nfaculty position in the ISYE department at University of Minnesota.\nPhD students Kristy Gardner and Timothy Zhu also received a small\namount of funding on this grant.  Kristy and Timothy graduated this\nyear.  Kristy accepted a tenure-track faculty position in the Computer\nScience department at Amherst College, while Timothy accepted a\ntenure-track faculty position in the Computer Science department at\nPenn State University.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mor Harchol-Balter"
