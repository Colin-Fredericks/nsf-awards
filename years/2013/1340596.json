Social innovation is not just one process. There are at least three processes for moving knowledge derived from research and academia into practice (a key feature of social innovation): transfer, translate, and transform.\n\nTransfer describes moving knowledge, ideas, and inventions across boundaries that share a common language and perhaps regularly share knowledge with one another. An example of this type of knowledge transfer occurs when professional schools in academic institutions host conferences or workshops for practitioners. Often innovation can move from academia to practitioners in this context. \n\nTranslate describes moving this knowledge across semantic boundaries that require interpretation of this knowledge along the way.

This is a very important activity for the so called \"wicked\" problems that challenge society. Facilitating these activities in classrooms, training institutes and other practice-based activities would lead to more creative solutions to social problems. In Session #2 of the workshop, Drs. Kickul and Lyons noted the significant challenge in providing useful training/courses across disciplines but when these efforts are successful the outcomes can be creative and innovative. It is also important to facilitate the interactions between the \"inventors\" of useful ideas, theories, and insights with the \"innovators\" that can apply this knowledge in the co..."
