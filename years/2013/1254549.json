 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to harness Smart Grid data (Big Data) to enable more resilient and efficient electricity. Three research sub-projects contribute to this goal. Project 1 combines a new ?Random Chemistry? computational algorithm with complex networks methods to find patterns of vulnerability in power systems, and uses the results to reduce cascading failure blackout risk. Project 2 transforms smart grid data into actionable information about the health of a power grid by looking at statistical properties (structured noise) in data from grid sensors. Projects 1 and 2 seeks to make power grids more resilient to fluctuations from renewable generation or weather events. Project 3 uses crowdsourcing to identify trends affecting residential energy consumption through a web-based energy efficiency social network. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis project integrates research ideas from diverse scientific disciplines, including complex systems, graph theory, data science, computational intelligence and crowdsourcing. Projects 1 and 2 use abstract complex systems approaches, while retaining critical information about the physics of power systems. By using data from real power systems the project will contribute to the emerging field of data science. The third project combines computational intelligence with crowdsourcing in a way that could open new ways to improve energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project tests new educational approaches, including a unique LEGO-based grid simulator, and integrates smart grid data into new courses. New curriculum and a hands on ?smart grid road show? will be leveraged to attract students from diverse educational and demographic backgrounds to study electric energy.",

In this method we run many cascading failure simulations and then use the data from those simulations to build a graph representation of the interdependencies among the transmission lines in a power network. The resulting system can find a small number of critical transmission lines (e.g., 5-10) that could be improved leading to an 80% reduction in blackout risk.

The project also supported a collaboration with Vermont?s transmission utility (VELCO), which led to a new project in which VELCO and the University of Vermont are working to develop a new software platform through which VELCO is studying the transmission system reliability changes that emerge as variable wind and solar generation grow rapidly in the US Northeast.</p>\n<p>This project also led to the development of a number of important and innovative educational outcomes.
