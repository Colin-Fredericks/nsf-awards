 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design skills and knowledge are critical to all fields of engineering as engineers design innovative solutions to meet the needs of today and tomorrow. Developing students? design understanding and abilities is thus a critical enterprise for the field of engineering education. However, a key ingredient in the design learning process is the feedback that students receive on both their design products and design processes. This engineering education research project builds on the investigators? prior experiences with characterizing and improving the feedback that instructors (as well as students themselves) provide on engineering students? mathematical modeling work. In this project, the investigators examine the differences that exist in the feedback provided by expert design educators compared to newer design educators compared to students (in peer review) to (1) characterize the form and substance of the feedback that expert design educators provide to promote learning and (2) develop materials to help students as well as less-experienced instructors learn how to provide better feedback. These materials will first be used to help local (i.e. Purdue) students and instructors to provide better feedback, and after assessing the effectiveness of the materials, the investigators will share the materials widely through publications and workshops to provide opportunities for other educators to improve their design feedback skills.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this research will have impact across design education and enhance the ability of faculty to create experiences that meet the attributes being called for by engineering accreditation boards, the National Academy of Engineering, and industry leaders in today's global economy. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.",
