 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective\r\nSweat for medical diagnostics has been largely overlooked in comparison to blood, urine, breath, and saliva.  Research now reveals that numerous water-soluble biomarkers for health monitoring or diagnosis can be found in sweat at comparable concentrations as in blood. Therefore, medical science is potentially on the verge of a transformative shift in fundamental approaches for non-invasive physiological sensing.  Of particular impact would be wearable biomarker sensors providing a fast readout of concentration(s).  However, this will require new electrical sensing technology, as current sweat biomarker biosensing is capable of only inorganic ion sensing (hydration, infant cystic fibrosis).  Moving toward molecular biosensing in sweat will require sensing of biomarker concentrations in the 1-10 pM range.  Preliminary studies of electrical sensing in biofluids suggest that sensing down to pM levels is possible.  However, neither sensing in the actual complex sweat sample matrix nor sub-pM sensing have been demonstrated.  Demonstrating sub-pM electrical sensing of biomarkers in sweat would provide breakthrough evidence on the viability of wearable sweat bio-sensing products.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe overall objective for this EAGER proposal is to demonstrate sub-pM electrical impedance spectroscopy detection, in real sweat, of at least 3 biomarkers of significant medical diagnostics.  Impedance spectroscopy is chosen because it is highly tunable to the various biorecognition elements that are immobilized on the sensing electrode surface, and it provides multifaceted detection including resistance, capacitance, charge transfer, and voltage responsive shape-change as biomarkers are captured by the biorecognition elements.  The proposed biomarker focus will be on those which exist in sweat in at least the 1-10 pM concentration range: (1) pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines;  and (2) neurotransmitters.   Specific aims leading to sub-pM sensitivity include: (1) frequency matching of interdigitated electrodes to the biomarker / biorecognition element response; (2) discovery of the optimal and highly homogeneous surface-orientation of the biorecognition elements for maximum impedance response; (3) deep investigation of charge-transfer, shape-change, ion-screening, and other factors as a function of finer stimuli such as waveform shape, potential magnitude, electrolyte solution pH, and ionic strength.  Success with these aims will then stimulate a surge of interest in sweat biosensing and enable pursuit of a broad array of commercial products.\r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIt is expected that the Success of the proposed work will lead to lower total health care costs by advancing personalized medicine and preventative care.  Broad social impacts include heat-stress management in athletics and firefighters, augmenting alertness in pilots and truckers, soldier PTSD prevention, and health baselining for advanced theranostics.  Dissemination plan includes organizing a self-sustaining annual international workshop on the Sensing of Biomarkers in Sweat.  This EAGER will enhance infrastructure in research and education for sweat sensing.  Integrated education plan includes support of an undergraduate research co-op at the university, who will then later intern at PI's partner federal labs.",

A number of challenges, however, have historically kept sweat from its place in the pantheon of clinical samples. These challenges include very low sample volumes (nanoliter to microliter), unknown concentration due to evaporation, filtration and dilution of large analytes, mixing of old and new sweat, and the potential for contamination from the skin surface.

However, this recent progress has also been limited to high concentration analytes (micromolar to millimolar) sampled at high sweat rates (&gt;1 nanoliter/min/gland, e.g. athletics). \nThis NSF EAGER proposal has directly addressed the question of accessing and sensing analytes such as large molecules and proteins, which appear in sweat at much lower concentrations of nanomolar to femtomolar.  Two major outcomes have been achieved.  First, we have developed and published the first microfluidic model of the eccrine sweat gland, which provides a first-ever basis for predicting analyte concentrations in sweat.  This model confirms that many analytes in sweat such as proteins, will appear in the picomolar to femtomolar range concentrations, and highlights the continued need to develop simple preconcentration techniques and sensors that are compatible with concentrated sweat.  The second major outcome, is that we have demonstrated limits of detection for proteins such as IL-6 down to 0.8 femtomolar concentrations using simple electrochemical aptamer based sensors.  These sensors can work continuously in biofluid for 24 hours or more, and are therefore strongly compatible with continuous sensing and preconcentration strategies.\nUltimately, the purpose of NSF EAGER work is to spur follow-on investment in science and technology.  This particular EAGER grant has led to &gt;$600k in additional federal funding for sweat sensing science and technology at the University of Cincinnati, and several million dollars in private investment for commercialization.  Specific to the aptamer-based electrochemical sensors, a significant portion of these follow-on investments is purposed to address sensing of low concentration analytes in sweat.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason C Heikenfeld"
