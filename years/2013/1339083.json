The committee will be informed by commissioned papers and by a 2-day public workshop that explores the current evidence. \r\n\r\nThe report will be written for policy-makers, funders, non-profit and private industry representatives, and other representatives from civic society. The primary goal of the report will be to help these audiences better understand and more strategically support investments in out-of-school STEM education, and to encourage partnerships that promote the linking of out-of-school STEM learning to school-based learning.\r\n\r\nThis study complements the NRC work done to produce the Successful K-12 STEM Education report and builds from prior NRC studies, especially Learning Science in Informal Environments, Surrounded by Science and Education for Work and Life: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century.",
