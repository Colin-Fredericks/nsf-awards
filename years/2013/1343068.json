The NAACL HLT conference is the ACL's major conference held annually in North America. This project subsidizes travel, conference registration, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop, which takes place during the main conference held on June 10-12 in Atlanta and in a one-day workshop on June 13th. The workshop accepts papers in two categories: thesis proposals and general research papers.  The thesis/research proposal can have only one author who must be a student.  The research papers can have multiple authors, with the first author being a student. The workshop is organized and run by students.\r\n\r\nThe Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the research community. It allows the students in the field to take an important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their dissertation committee, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and reviewing for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing community.",

The grant also funded a lunch for all participants at the NAACL 2013 student research workshop and an end-of-workshop panel discussion on promising future directions for NLP research.  The workshop offered a unique opportunity for students to present their work at the top venue for natural language processing research in North America and to discuss their work with distinguished scholars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric K Ringger"
