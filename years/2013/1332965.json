 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to investigate the effect of porosity and to develop constitutive models accounting for this effect in two different types of kinematically constrained material systems. Examples of the first type include low-symmetry metals, such as magnesium and zirconium alloys, which are nominally incompressible polycrystalline aggregates, but which can undergo significant volumetric strains when porosity is present. Examples of the second type include magnetic shape-memory alloys, such as nickel-manganese-gallium systems, which have been found to exhibit \"giant\" field-induced strains in costly single crystals, but only minimal magnetostriction in cheaper polycrystals. In this case, the presence of porosity can help relax the internal kinematic constraints in the polycrystal due to the strong orientational character of the magnetostriction in the grains that tend to block each other?s strains. The main challenge is to properly account for the dilatational and relaxational effects of the porosity in constitutive models for the response of these materials under general loading conditions. This will be accomplished by means of a recently developed \"iterated\" nonlinear homogenization technique, which makes use of suitably chosen \"linear comparison\" media to generate highly accurate and efficient estimates for the coupled, nonlinear response of porous single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of these materials.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include improved understanding and advanced modeling of the mechanical properties of high-performance metal alloys for energy-efficient applications in the automotive, aerospace and nuclear industries, as well as of the magneto-elastic response of magnetic shape-memory alloys for applications such as actuators, sensors and energy-harvesting devices. The research is also expected to lead to improved characterization of net-shape metal-forming operations, as well as of ductile failure in polycrystalline materials via void growth and coalescence. In addition, the results will be of interest for modeling of geomaterials, such as ice, halite and olivine.  The work may also be relevant for the development of other active material systems, such as certain types of polycrystalline ferroelectrics.",

In this project, we have developed a general class of robust consitutive models for porous viscoplastic single crystals and polycrystals.

The principal outcomes are: 1) For high-anisotropy (low-symmetry, e.g. HCP) porous single crystals, the porosity and other microstructural variables have a strong effect on the shape and size of the yield potential, leading to complex hardening effects, including distortional hardening. 2) Even for low-anisotropy (high-symmetry, e.g. FCC) porous single crystals, the evolution of porosity and total creep strain is strongly dependent on the loading orientation relative to the crystal axes, consistent with recent full-field numerical simulations from the literature. 3) For porous polycrystals, it was found that---even when the initial texture is isotropic---the macroscopic response was highly sensitive to the loading conditions, and could be correlated with the evolution of the various microstructures variables. To a first approximation, it was found that porosity controls the response at high triaxialities, while texture evolution controls a low triaxialities. On the other hand, it was also found that the evolution of texture did not have a big effect on the evolution of the porosity, so that, to a good approximation, the pure hardening (softening) effect of the texture evolution at low triaxialities prevails over the corresponding relatively modest effects of porosity evolution. 4) Surprisingly, while the effect of texture evolution at low triaxialities was much stronger for high-anisotropy porous polycrystals, its effect was significant even for low-anisotropy porous polycrystals As a consequence, models based on isotropic (von Mises) plasticity can lead to incorrect predictions for the overall hardening/softening of the porous polycrystals. This may help explain some of the inconsistencies between theoretical predictions for the dependence of overall ductility on triaxiality and Lode angle based on isotropic-matrix porous models and corresponding experimental results. 5) The overall conclusion is that the evolution of the microstructure (porosity, void shape and orientation, as well as texture) all conspire to determine the macroscopic response of porous materials, with different microstructures variables having different effects and having the potential to become the dominant mechanism under different loading conditions.
