 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: This research project investigates iridium modified silicon surfaces at (001) and (111) orientations using surface science tools such as  scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The project contains two major research components. The first component focuses on iridium silicide nanowires formed on Si(001) surface. The physical and electronic properties of these nanowires are investigated. The second research component is on the electronic properties of the root-7 by root-7 phase observed on Ir/Si(111) surface. The research is carried out at the University of North Dakota, in collaboration with other scientists nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: Investigation of the initial stages of thin-film growth on various semiconductor surfaces is important because of the technological relevance of these interfaces and the novel physics that these interfaces exhibit. This research project focuses on iridium-silicon interface, which has not been investigated extensively. In addition to the fundamental understanding gained during the course of the project, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the art of research. The students involved in this project learn technologically relevant topics such as nanoelectronics, low-dimensional physics, and semiconductors. In addition, the project includes outreach activities that are designed to attract participants from local/tribal high-school students.",
