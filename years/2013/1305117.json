 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Peter M. Iovine of the University of San Diego will develop new chemistries to functionalize starch-based polymeric materials and to incorporate them into more complex macromolecular architectures.  Starch is a versatile polymeric materials platform due to its abundance, biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural diversity, and molecular recognition behavior.  The research objectives include studying and optimizing chain end-modifying reactions that lead to the installation of click synthons, developing a new class of natural-synthetic hybrid polymer featuring amylose or amylopectin side chains, and synthesizing and studying amylose-based self-assembled polymers.  The broader impacts focus primarily on the high quality mentoring of undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers.  Beyond these core outcomes, the project impacts include curriculum development, community outreach activities, and the support of interdisciplinary research in the undergraduate environment.\r\n\r\nPolymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  Polymers can be classified as either naturally occurring or synthetic, meaning they have been synthesized using raw materials that can be traced back to petrochemicals.  This research explores the preparation of hybrid polymers, consisting of a combination of both natural and synthetic polymers.  More specifically, this research focuses on studying and utilizing starch, an abundant and cheap raw material, as the natural component of the hybrid polymers.  Such fundamental knowledge about starch chemistry could lead to new technologies for biomedical materials, personal care products, and packaging materials, amongst many possible uses.",
