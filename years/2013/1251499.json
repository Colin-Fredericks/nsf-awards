 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an effort to advance Continental Scientific Drilling in the USA, DOSECC is organising a\r\nseries of topical workshops. The workshop proposed here has two objectives, firstly to advance\r\nscientific studies of active high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems, and secondly to foster collaboration\r\nbetween academic scientists, government agencies, and industry. Such collaboration is highly\r\ndesirable because the scientific study of active hydrothermal systems requires drilling and\r\nsampling boreholes whose costs far exceed budgets normally available to academic scientists,\r\nwhereas the geothermal industry commonly drills wells that access them.\r\n\r\nThe Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) represents an excellent example of such a collaboration.\r\nFrom the outset academic scientists have been deeply involved in that project. The IDDP is\r\ninvestigating the economic feasibility of producing electricity from supercritical geothermal\r\nreservoirs. To test this concept an industry consortium planned to drilled a deep well in\r\nthe volcanic caldera of Krafla. However drilling had to be terminated at 2.1 km depth when\r\n900C rhyolite magma flowed into the well. Today the well is highly productive, estimated to\r\nbe capable of generating >35 MWe of dry superheated steam at a well-head temperature of ~440C.\r\nThere is a significant undeveloped potential for developing high-enthalpy geothermal systems\r\nin the western USA, Hawaii and Alaska. Although drilling into these deep unconventional geothermal\r\nreservoirs is more expensive, the higher productivity per well should offset this.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to compile and distribute a report that addresses industry's interest, abilities,\r\nresearch needs, and potential for collaborative projects that drill high-enthalpy systems.\r\nThis will be based on the results of a broadly distributed questionnaire, and a three day\r\nworkshop with participation by industry, government and university scientists. Hopefully this\r\nwill help create a national program that enhances the scientific, technological and institutional\r\nbasis for the development of new and more economic sources of alternative energy.",
