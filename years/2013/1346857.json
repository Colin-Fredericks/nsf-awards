 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Schoolyard Book Series was established in 2004 to engage elementary school students and their families in learning about the earth's ecosystems, both locally and internationally, through narratives that reflect the dynamic research being conducted at the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Sites. This project extends the book series in several important ways. First, funding will support publication of three new books, one from each of the Hubbard Brook Forest, Plum Island Ecosystem, and the Jornada Experimental Range projects. Second, existing books will be translated into different languages in order to extend their impacts. Third, electronic versions of the books will be developed along with additional instructional materials. By engaging a Series Editor, the project will ensure direct engagement with the education and trade book markets. Familiarity with content delivery trends and new publishing ideas will keep the Series Editor informed and able to be nimble with developing future books. Taken together, these activities will provide a solid foundation for advancement of the educational and outreach goals of the LTER network.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the project lies primarily in its broader impacts. It will significantly extend the impact of the LTER Schoolyard Book Series by broader sharing of place-based knowledge about ecosystems with elementary school students. The proposed translation of existing books into other languages provides the opportunity to reach a wide diversity of under-served audiences both within the US and around the world. Many local partnerships will be formed to distribute and use these books and to provide professional development to teachers who adopt the books. The series has great potential to help teachers meet Common Core English Language Arts Standards while simultaneously educating students about the natural world and about the profession of scientific research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIllustrated children\u2019s books offer an excellent tool for science education, perhaps especially in the field of long-term ecological research.  They offer an opportunity to present the results of scientific research in a compelling narrative format that is easy for children to understand.  Illustrations help to bring the story to life, and can often help with explaining scientific ideas than can be quite complex.  Unfamiliar study sites, such as the Arctic Tundra of Alaska, can be made real by vivid illustrations.  In their hard copy format, illustrated children\u2019s books are something tangible that can be handed out for reading sessions in schools, used at outreach events, or purchased by grandparents.  In an electronic format, illustrated children\u2019s books can be enhanced with audio and video, offering an opportunity, for example, for actual animal noises to be heard. \n\n \n\nThe Schoolyard LTER book series is the result of a coordinated science and education effort across the LTER Network.  During the period of this grant, seven new books have been added to the Schoolyard LTER book series, bringing the total now in the series to sixteen.  This means that just over half of current LTER sites now have a book.  The most recent book, Counting on Caribou associated with the Arctic LTER is currently being printed and will be released in May 2020 (it is already available for pre-order on Amazon).  These books have been written and developed to serve the education and outreach needs of individual sites and efforts have been made to align with national education standards.  The grant has also paid for sites to purchase a number of copies of the books (usually around 200), so that they can use them in their education and outreach efforts.\n\n \n\nMore than just adding to the number of titles, the current grant has seen a sustained effort to promote the series as a whole. While many of our efforts to encourage the next generation of scientists are necessarily site specific and local, the Schoolyard LTER book series represents an important attempt to mirror the collaborative and comparative scientific work of the LTER network.  A child who enjoys one title in the series can be encouraged to read a book from another site.  The stories tend to have a similar format and the illustrations create a similar style.  Engaging with different books in the series might raise interesting cross site comparisons: what, for example, are some of the differences between a marine ecosystem and a terrestrial ecosystem?  How can the lives of caribou in Alaska be compared to the lives of bison in Kansas?  By really focusing on promoting the series as a whole, we hope that it becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\n \n\nIn addition to focusing on the network aspect of the Schoolyard LTER book series, this grant has allowed us to do more to promote diversity in science education and outreach.  The characters in our stories are racially diverse and include both males and females.  This allows more of our readers to see themselves represented in the books, potentially making them feel more connected to the stories and more likely to pursue careers in science.  We have also taken a the opportunity to translate a number of our books into foreign langugages, to make them more accessible to a wider audience.   In these way, the Schoolyard LTER book series is contributing to wider efforts to diversify the work of the LTER Network. \n\n \n\nThis grant has helped to create a strong foundation for the future education and outreach efforts of the LTER Network.  Like the sites in the LTER Network, the books are deeply rooted in specific ecosystems, but working together they can help to tell a much wider story about environmental diversity and change over time. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian Howkins"
