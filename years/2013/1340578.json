Some comparative cost analysis will be performed. The project will be performed at OSU with undergraduates (both white students and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups).\r\n\r\nShould this research be successful, it will create a new and more informative way to assess students? knowledge -- one that takes into account all the knowledge he/she brings to bear on the study of STEM education. This could provide instructors, and the students themselves, with more helpful and powerful information to improve teaching methods and learning approaches, respectively. \r\n",
