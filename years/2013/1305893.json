 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: Interfacial contact layers (ICLs) have been shown to improve organic solar cell performance and stability. However, how different ICL materials function with different active layer materials is not well understood, and the commonly used ICL materials today suffer from several limitations and drawbacks. This project focuses on solution synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles for interfacial contact layers in organic solar cells and on experimental and simulation studies of their role in affecting charge separation, transport, and collection. The synthesis component of the project aims to understand and improve the physical and electronic properties of the metal-oxide nanoparticles for specific active layer components in solution to avoid the need of aggressive post processing. In addition to materials characterization, the nanoparticles' effectiveness as ICL materials on the photon-to-electron conversion process is studied through device testing and frequency-domain spectroscopies, which probe the charge recombination and transport dynamics. To understand the experimental results, realistic Monte Carlo device modeling is employed to pinpoint the dominant charge carrier loss mechanism(s). Additionally, currently available drift-diffusion transport model assumes uniform generation, which is only applicable for weak absorbers. In this project, two open-source simulation codes are integrated to model drift-diffusion transport in multi-layer solar cells. The knowledge gained from this interdisciplinary research is expected to improve our understanding of photogenerated carrier dynamics in organic systems.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: The project addresses the needs of energy harvesting and other organic electronic technologies, including new materials, novel synthesis approaches, and a combination of characterization techniques and state-of-art modeling to improve our knowledge in energy harvesting process. The computer programs developed in this project are to be available to the public. In addition to graduate student education, the project enables hands-on participation of the Dallas-area high-school and undergraduate students, providing opportunities for US youngsters to approach Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The principal investigators also participate in outreach activities to K-12 students, in recruitment and retention of women and under-represented minority students, and in serving the broader scientific communities through various professional societies.",

In the first area, we synthesize p-type copper-based delafossites for hole transport layers in addition to the common binary oxides. Our research supported by this NSF grant has produced 27 refereed journal papers, 29 invited talks, and ~ 30 contributed talks and posters by students at international conferences. 4 students obtained their PhD degrees between 2015 and 2019 have been fully or partially involved in research activities in this project. This grant results in infrastructure at UT Dallas for solution synthesis of oxide nanocrystals, complete fabrication and testing facilities for organic solar cells, light biased external quantum efficiency spectroscopy, light modulated impedance spectroscopy, ambient characterization capabilities of electronic structures, transfer matrix method and drift diffusion modeling to understand photogeneration, transport, and recombination of carriers inside OSCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong>&nbsp;Scientifically, we gained understanding of the structure-property relation in organic semiconductors, specifically in charge transport and recombination, as well as chemical and electronic interactions with substrates. We also developed contact layer materials that can be used in other solar cell systems, e.g. organic-inorganic perovskite, and other optoelectronic devices, e.g. light emitting diodes. On the educational aspect, four graduate students (Jian Wang, Diego Barrera, Liang Xu, and Trey Daunis) supported on this grant have received their PhD degrees; Jian Wang has been awarded Washington Research Foundation Innovation Fellowships in Clean Energy. In addition, fifteen (15) undergraduates and eight (8) high school students have participated in research activities in Hsu?s lab from 2013 to 2019. Some of the high school students use their results from the summer for Science fair or Siemen?s competition. Five (5) of them have produced critical results and earned co-authorship on our publications. In addition, Hsu gave talks at middle school Career Day, on research conduct to NSF REU students yearly, and Materials Science discipline and solar energy harvesting to undergraduates, and organized a workshop on various careers for high school students. Brandon Adkison, a Biochemistry undergraduate, published his research results in the Exley, the UTD?s undergraduate research journal, and presented a poster in the 2015 Materials Advantage Poster Competition at Texas A&amp;M University. James Trey, an Electrical Engineering undergraduate, presented his results at the American Physical Society meeting in March 2019. For almost all of them, this is their first exposure to research and provides a valuable experience as they develop their interest and goals for their academic and career pursuits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Julia&nbsp;Hsu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305893/1305893_10277063_1572725842687_ZnObandgap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305893/1305893_10277063_1572725842687_ZnObandgap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Controlling ZnO Nanoparticle Size and Bandgap through Synthesis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1305893/1305893_10277063_1572725842687_ZnObandgap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Controlling ZnO Nanoparticle Size and Bandgap through Synthesis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Left) Transmission electron microscopy images of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized with different water concentrations.
