Based on research introducing the application-aware and decoupled-execution paradigm concept, the project addresses the big gap between research prototypes and the engineering solution. Impact on future applications, algorithms, and instruments design is expected since the instrument could open up new research areas in supporting data-intensive sciences and possibly reshape HPC instruments adopted in National Computing Facilities and some institutions. In addition to the conventional HPC compute nodes, DISCI has a set of specially designed data nodes. The data nodes offer in-situ data processing to reduce data movement and data-access delay and dynamic provisioning as 'fat' compute nodes when necessary, while the functionality of compute nodes remains the same as in conventional instrumentation. These data nodes work with compute nodes in concert and together they provide an optimum system performance for data-intensive HPC. Based on a hardware-software co-development principle, the instrument consists of two components: the DISCI system architecture and the DISCI runtime software. The system architecture builds an HPC instrument with a data-centric view. The runtime software extends the MPI (Message Passing Interface) and MPI-IO library to support data nodes and their associated in-situ processing. The instrument will enable and foster research activities in the areas of chemical dynamics simulation, simulations of turbulent flows, atmospheric data assimilation and weather forecasting, computational biology, and computer systems that PIs and senior personnel conduct. \r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\nThis development project will enable academic departments, cross-disciplinary units, organizations, and multi-organization collaborations to integrate their development, education, and outreach efforts. \r\nTo attract underrepresented students into the DISCI development, the institution will coordinate with institutional projects at respective organizations. The experience gained will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses and summer orientation trainings to get students involved in the development. The education plan concentrates on supporting data-intensive HPC and training a broadly inclusive and globally competitive science workforce. The project is expected to provide the pathway to future national HPC instruments to support data-intensive sciences. Furthermore, it could have a direct impact on building exascale HPC instruments.",

The new development is to integrate dedicated data-processing nodes (or data nodes in short) into HPC instruments in addition to compute nodes. The functionality of compute nodes remains the same as in conventional HPC instruments. Data nodes, however, are tightly connected with storage or compute nodes to offer near-data processing for minimizing data movement and data-access latency. The outcomes of this project are three-fold. First, this project created a new computing infrastructure that supported a variety of data-intensive scientific and HPC system level research. Meantime, the development of DISCI changes the existing HPC design and builds a data-centric HPC instrument. The instrument and experience resulted from the development of DISCI will have an impact on HPC infrastructures that are widely deployed in national leadership computing facilities and on a variety of scientific disciplines that use high performance computing simulations for discovery and innovation. Second, this project has led to many research results and several software releases. The DISCI infrastructure has enabled over thirty high-quality research publications and enabled software creations like Goblin-Core64 as an open-source system architecture particularly designed for data-intensive high-performance computing, the development of Hybrid Memory Cube simulator to facilitate research of building 3D-stacked memory to dramatically improve compute-to-bandwidth relationship in HPC systems for data-intensive problems, and the development of a data center simulator with the vendor Dell Inc. to support experimenting and testing new methods in managing, automating, and controlling large-scale computing infrastructures. Third, this project has trained many students and provided an excellent venue for outreach and community building efforts. This project has direct impact on around fifteen graduate and undergraduate students who are involved in this project and has indirect impact on even more students who learn high-performance computing, computer systems, and computer science in general. This project has stimulated numerous community building efforts including the creation of the International Workshop on Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems (DISCS) and the International Workshop on Data-center Automation, Analytics, and Control (DAAC). These efforts have motivated community&rsquo;s attention and collective efforts in addressing challenges of data-driven sciences and provisioning advanced computing infrastructures for the needs. All these efforts carried out through this project have an impact in training and developing the future workforce, as well as in contributing new knowledge and technology development for the society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yong&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043829472_disci-02--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043829472_disci-02--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043829472_disci-02--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yong Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yong&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043853208_disci-04--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043853208_disci-04--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043853208_disci-04--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yong Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yong&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Instrument (DISCI)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043935795_IMG_6736--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043935795_IMG_6736--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Touring for Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043935795_IMG_6736--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Touring for Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Touring for Students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yong Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yong&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Touring for Students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043969154_2014-05-3015.57.09--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043969154_2014-05-3015.57.09--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Touring for Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338078/1338078_10273347_1550043969154_2014-05-3015.57.09--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Touring for Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Touring for Students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yong Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yong&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Touring for Students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
