 "awd_abstract_narration": "Divergent mate recognition traits can play a pivotal role in speciation by curtailing gene flow between newly formed species through the evolution of like-mating within differentiated populations. Changes in communication between males and females predict a genetic correlation between male mating signals and female preferences.  Testing hypotheses about the male and female genetic components of the intraspecific communication system will advance knowledge of how these associations arise.  Using next-generation sequencing approaches, genetic lines that contain differentiated genes involved the origin of species will be mapped in the genome and their gene products will sequenced.  The approach taken is to 1) to test the co-localization of song and preference genes, 2) translate the results into a nucleotide genome map to generate candidate genes underlying behavioral change, and 3) build a data set of expressed genes that associates with different behaviors.  A targeted genome assembly and gene annotation will also be undertaken. Data will be stored and available based upon type of data.  WAV files will be stored on DYRAD (www.dyrad.com), while sequence data will be deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. \r\n\r\nThe project will have multiple broader impacts.  Many of the fascinating behaviors that illustrate principles in behavioral ecology and evolution come from \"non-model\" organisms whereas the genetic insights into behavior often come from \"model\" genetic organisms.  The integration of natural behavioral variation (male signal and female preference) with advanced genomic approaches provides a bridge between model-genetic study and natural behavioral systems.  Insights promise one of the best empirical and conceptual bridges to explain diversification.  From the education and outreach perspective, the project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and efforts to reach out to the public will continue via contributions to public science centers and museum events centered on insects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInnate behavior is often complex, involving the interactions between organisms.  The genetic basis of innate behavior is a frontier of knowledge and we are just beginning to identify genes that alter complex, innate behavior of organisms.  Acoustic communication between males and females during courtship (e.g bird, frog or cricket song) is an example of this interactive behavior, and is vitally important to pairing males and females for reproduction and thus species persistence.  In addition, innate communication behaviors between the sexes evolve rapidly, and is likely a contributing factor as to why new species arise.   Our research used a gene mapping approach to identify candidate genes that cause differences in acoustic communication behavior in a group of Hawaiian cricket species characterized by rapid speciation.  We used a genomics approach to create maps of four regions of the genome where male song genes and female acoustic preference genes reside. \n\n \n\nIntellectual merit:  Developing approaches and testing hypotheses about the origins of species in a diversity of organisms is vital to understanding natural conditions in which the diversity of species thrive, which is likewise vital to understanding our negative impact on those species.  Our research has shown the striking result that genes causing changes in acoustic communication behavior are localized in the same regions of the genome.  The implications for this finding include insights into how functional behavior is maintained during periods of rapid behavioral change and the origin of new species, and the powerful role that acoustic communication plays in species maintenance.  We have identified a number of candidate genes that will enable more focused approaches to test the causal role of those genes in behavior.  During the course of this work, we have made discoveries of genes that are involved in the behavior of other organisms including behavioral disease in humans.  An integral part of this research has included the development of extensive genomic resources including an assembled genome sequence for the fastest speciating invertebrate, and a unique transcriptome, both resources that are now being used by other researchers to make progress in their work.  \n\n \n\nBroader impacts: The integration of the mechanistic behavioral sciences (neurobiology, psychology) with the study of animal behavior, natural selection, evolution and genomics is underdeveloped despite being crucial to understanding our impact on biodiversity and our ability to manage that impact.  Our research provides unique training for students and post doctoral scholars by integrating these different areas of research.  Conducing this research has contributed to the unique training of four postdocs, three graduate students, and nine undergraduate students (of which five were women and four were from underrepresented groups).  One woman recently obtained a faculty position.  One person of color was recently accepted to Law School.  The participants represent diverse cultures primarily from the U.S. as well and internationally. Professional students among these participants have attended international conferences and obtained extremely valuable scientific skills associated with the goals of the project.  We have published our work in professional journals and outreach venues such as Scientific American.  We have presented our findings at professional conferences and venues for the general public.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kerry L Shaw"
