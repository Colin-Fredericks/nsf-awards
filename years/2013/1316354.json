 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Laramie Paige Jameson of Texas Christian University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan.  The project title is \"Ionic Liquids in Micelles: Controlling the Conformation of Small Molecules.\" The host scientist is Professor Noriho Kamiya. \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the advance of an underdeveloped, yet potentially useful paradigm regarding the ability of ionic liquids to control chemical, physical and structural properties of small molecules by simply placing them structurally similar, yet distinct (in regard to physical properties) solvents. Recent work suggests that adjusting the aggregation state of ionic liquids can modulate the conformational equilibrium of small molecules. The aggregation state of ionic liquids appears to depend on the structure of the cationic and anionic counterparts. This project tests the hypothesis that the aggregation state of ionic liquids can be altered by the incorporation of ionic liquids into a confined environment (such as reverse micelles). Thus, the research evaluates the ability of ionic liquids in reverse micelles to modulate the conformation of small molecules and compares it to the neat ionic liquids. It is anticipated that the results of the proposed research might be applicable for the design of electronic devices, sensors, nanoreactors, as well as novel membranes and drug delivery systems. Overall, this research is likely to have impacts on the fields of ionic liquids and spectroscopy, as well as synthetic and materials chemistry, and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goals to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the EAPSI experience will allow the Fellow to become a more effective mentor to foreign visiting scientists during postdoctoral years and in future positions as a Professor.",
