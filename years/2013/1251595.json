The course concerned, Project-Based Learning  Advanced Placement Environmental Science (PBL-APES), was co-designed with a suburban school district.  The investigators propose in this (2.5 year, medium empirical) project to study the migration of PBL-APES to two diverse, poverty-impacted urban districts. A design-based implementation research approach will be employed to develop and test specific supports for productive disciplinary engagement that address the wide range of student literacy and domain knowledge that the investigators and others have observed in urban settings.",
