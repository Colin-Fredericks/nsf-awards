 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the\r\nChemistry Division, Prof. Theodore L. Einstein of University of Maryland and Prof. Ludwig Bartels of\r\nthe University of California, Riverside, and their students will use a combination of scanning tunneling\r\nmicroscopy and methods of statistical mechanics, especially Monte Carlo simulations and lattice-gas\r\nmodeling, to understand the formation of large regular self-organized networks of acene-related\r\nmolecules on substrates with prominent metallic surface states and the role of the resulting nanoscale\r\npores in providing boundaries that modify the arrangements and reactions of small adsorbates like CO\r\ntherein. With international collaborators we will test theories of modification (from large surfaces) key\r\nreaction rates because of altered entropy of mixing in the confined pores and will study the relation of the\r\nsuperstructure to the surface state on the close-packed face of the copper substrate and investigate the\r\ncorrections to a simple picture of dot-induced pore formation. We will also take advantage of research in\r\ntwo dimensional (2D) materials dominated by electronic states with many similarities to metallic surface\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide state of the art modeling and/or laboratory experiences for graduate and\r\nundergraduate students who will be learning the techniques of scanning probe microscopy and\r\ncomplementary Monte Carlo simulations and calculations of correlation functions, as well as ab initio\r\nelectronic structure calculations to help parameterize the statistical mechanical studies. The project\r\nconsists of an exploration of the formation of regular porous superstructures by organic molecules on\r\nsubstrates with slowly decaying 2D electronic states. The validation of the novel explanation of pore\r\nstabilization by 2D quantum-dot-like states will be pursued. The impact of such states on the distribution\r\nof small adsorbates (especially carbon monoxide) within the pore will be scrutinized. Calculations of\r\nassociated parameters will require use of the latest advances in incorporating van der Waals interactions\r\ninto density functional theory computations. Through leadership by a theorist experienced in statistical\r\nphysics, this project will foster systematic perspective, deeper understanding and faster testing of results\r\nfor phase and pattern formation and predictions promising alternative substrates and adsorbates. The\r\nproposed work is expected to have impact on industrial methodologies and society at large by providing\r\naccess to large arrays of identical nanoscale cells in which one can do the experimental equivalent of\r\nparallel computation. Control of such structures will allow tuning of cell sizes to select for favorable\r\nconfigurations and enhance particular reactions, as well as to explore natural fluctuations. The work will\r\nalso provide opportunities for educational and outreach activities with proven broad national,\r\ninternational and societal impact.",
