 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harvard University will undertake a retrospective cohort study to analyze college students? education background and previous IT-related experiences for predictors of performance when students study Computer Science in college, while controlling for demographic differences.  The study will reveal how decisions concerning the use of technology made by high school teachers in the teaching of science and mathematics and the growing number of high school computer science courses relate to the performance of 12,000 college computer science students nationwide, who will be recruited from randomly selected 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities.  This study has the capacity to both reveal and evaluate the use of the most promising educational practices and interventions, including both in-school computing instruction and after-school programs, competitions, and clubs, and to assess the effects of a match between experiences during the high school years with the evolving landscape of introductory college computer science courses.  Such knowledge can only help to ameliorate the high failure rates that prematurely end the pursuit of a potential computer science degree, especially for females and under-represented minorities who historically opt out of this field earlier and in greater numbers than other classmates. Both college and high school computer science instructors can also benefit from understanding the factors contributing to effective preparation for students? first college computer science course.",

The major goal has been to reveal how the decisions concerning the use of computers made by high school teachers in the teaching of science and mathematics and of the growing number of high school computer science courses relate to the performance of more than 10,000 college computer science students nationwide, who were recruited from 118 randomly selected two-year and four-year colleges and universities. The following are some notable results (currently submitted for publication):</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">1. What is the relationship between students&rsquo; first programming languages (if they had prior experience) and their final grades in their introductory college computer science (ICCS) course, as well as their attitudes about computing?</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Our analysis suggested that having prior programming experience positively impacted attitudes about computer science, compared with the control group, although no difference was found between the effects of graphical and textual programming languages. We also found that having any prior programming experience had a positive effect on grades in ICCS courses. Importantly, students who were first introduced to graphical languages scored higher than did students who were first introduced to textual languages when the languages were introduced in or before early adolescent years (age ranges of 6 to 10 years and younger). See Figure 1.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">2. Do students who have previous experience with coding on their own have an advantage in introductory college computer science courses?</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">We found that college students who had programmed on their own (who are termed &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; within the computer science community) before college had a more positive attitude towards computer science, lower odds of dropout, and earned higher grades for the ICCS course than other students. Moreover, nearly half of the effect of this experience on the final ICCS grade was mediated by the positive attitude. Figure 2 compares the ICCS grade of those with no previous coding experience (NONE) with those who had only coded on their own (COWBOY-ONLY), those who had first coded on their own and then had taken a high school computing class (COWBOY-&gt;CLASS), those with the reverse sequence (CLASS-&gt;COWBOY), and those who had only taken a computing class (CLASS-ONLY). A similarly positive impact derived from all three constellations in which coding on one's own was involved.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">3. What topics are covered and what instructional methods are used in high school computer science classes? And what impact do these pedagogical characteristics of high school computer science classes have on subsequent college computer science performance?</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Regarding the first question, we found the frequencies displayed in Figure 3.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">As to the second question, we found, for most students, that the more frequently they engaged in coding-related activities (programming, debugging, and studying algorithms), the higher were their grades in ICCS courses. Conversely, the more frequently students engaged in non-coding computer use (e.g., data analysis and computer security), the lower their college computer science grades. However, high frequencies of coding-related activity in high school were associated with high college computer science grades only for students who did not receive programming support from their parents. In ICCS courses in which instructors employed innovative pedagogies, higher SAT/ACT mathematics scores were more strongly associated with higher grades than they were in traditionally taught courses. Moreover, in innovatively taught ICCS courses, students who had been tested on vocabulary in high school computer science courses received relatively lower grades, on average, than did students who had not been tested on vocabulary.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522340976216_Figure1(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522340976216_Figure1(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522340976216_Figure1(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interaction of the age at which a student is first exposed to a programming language and the type of language in predicting the grade earned in a student?s first college computer science course</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341063089_Figure2(3)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341063089_Figure2(3)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341063089_Figure2(3)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Type and sequence of coding experiences versus the grade earned in a student?s first college computer science course</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341191775_Figure3(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341191775_Figure3(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1339200/1339200_10278415_1522341191775_Figure3(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Frequencies of computer science learning pedagogies and experiences in high school computer science courses, as reported by the students in the FICSIT study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
