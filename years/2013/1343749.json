 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NUE in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Experience for Nanotechnology Education\", at the University of Central Florida (UCF) is under the direction of Dr. Jayan Thomas. The goal of this proposal is to develop a new discussion-based interactive learning strategy for undergraduate nanotechnology education. The Collaborative Networked Virtual Experiences for Nanotechnology \r\nEducation (CONVENE) module will transform traditional lecture-intensive teaching methods to more interesting interactive learning. The rationale behind this approach is that, in a nanotechnology class, discussions based on virtual experiments using nano devices help students better understand the principles of nanotechnology. The CONVENE module addresses the challenges of explaining critical concepts and the working of nanosystems and devices to students in the classroom setting (and beyond) in a highly dynamic and interactive manner. \r\n\r\nA major challenge of current undergraduate nanotechnology education is the lack of an efficient method for teaching and learning nanoscience that requires student participation and collaboration. With the PIs expertise in nanoscale device design and fabrication, human interface design and education, the program will develop several interactive visual tools that can be used effectively in the CONVENE module to provide a collaborative virtual experience for undergraduate education. The transformative aspect of the program is the use of virtual experiments to stimulate interaction and discussion in a nanotechnology class which will provide an in-depth knowledge of nanotechnology and enrich students' learning experience. In a lecture class environment, students will be able to learn principles and experiments in nanotechnology by virtually manipulating nanosystems and nanodevices. Moreover, the CONVENE module is designed so that students and instructors can continue discussion beyond their regular class at anytime and anywhere using a shared display in any portable device. It will provide students the sense of involvement and transform a less inspiring class into a highly dynamic and interesting one.\r\n\r\nMass application of nanotechnology in product and device development is expected by 2020. As the scale and scope of nanotechnology advances to new heights, there is an imperative to educate future generation of qualified scientists and engineers in this highly challenging field. The proposed module is tailored to the interests of the students and the topics covered\r\nare relevant to the state-of-the-art nanotechnology device and system developments in accordance with industry and research requirements. This approach will generate systematically educated undergraduates with considerable nanotechnology device development skills. Annually, at least 250 students will be directly benefitted and about 350 undergraduate students will be indirectly benefitted by the CONVENE module in UCF. In addition, annually, CONVENE related virtual experiments will be beneficial to about 300 undergraduate students in various science and engineering classes in Valencia State College. This module will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups at both institutions. In addition, in order to educate high school students and the general public, portable display equipment will be developed which is capable of providing physical involvement for the user while performing simple virtual nanotechnology experiments.",
