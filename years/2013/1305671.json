The conference will cover mathematical logic, broadly interpreted, including set theory, model theory, recursion theory, logic in computer science, and philosophy of mathematics. The conference will continue a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. \r\n\r\nThe conference will be a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. The conference will be advertised to attract a large audience. Graduate students and researchers at early career stages, in particular, will be encouraged to participate. The organizers will ensure that women and minority mathematicians are made aware of the conference and are strongly encouraged to participate.",
