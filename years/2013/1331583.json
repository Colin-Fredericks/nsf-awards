 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kirigami (from the Japanese kiru, which means to cut) offers a previously unattainable level of design, dynamics, and deployability to self-folding and self-unfolding materials from the molecular to the architectural scale. \"The art of structure is how and where to put holes,\" said structural engineer and architect, Le Ricolais. The objective of this research project is to take this principle to the next level: buildable, bendable, and biological stuctures.  To achieve this, DNA-polymer hybrids are being cut and joined to build on the nanoscale. The project also uses three-dimensional printing and modeling to study and prototype geometries that utilize origami and kirigami designs on the macroscopic scale.  \r\n \r\nIf successful, this research will introduce new motifs, portability, and design to form intricate chemical, biological, and architectural materials all from a common language.  New tools will be developed to visualize folding and optimization of two- and three-dimensional structures.  These tools will generate new hybrid building blocks at the nano- and human-scale, creating new principles of architecture, materials synthesis, and biological structures. New technologies will be developed supporting metamaterials, sensors, stealth aircrafts, and adaptive and sustainable buildings.  Like the opening and closing of flowers, satellites, and even greeting cards, this research will offer a rich and diverse set of intricate surprises, problems, and challenges for students at all levels, and broaden their interest and awareness of emerging science and engineering. It will also create a significant opportunity to excite the general public, thus, complementing and enhancing our impact on science, art, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.",
