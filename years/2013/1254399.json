However, two major challenges need to be overcome to reap the benefits of this class of biosensors: (i) state-of-theart plasmonic biosensors either offer limited sensitivity or are impractical for real-world applications due to their poor stability and excessive cost; (ii) these biosensors rely on natural antibodies, which are high-cost and impose severe limitations in handling, storage and device integration. We propose to realize highly sensitive and inexpensive plasmonic sensors. The focus of the proposed effort will be hierarchically ordered, self-assembled arrays of chemically synthesized plasmonic nanostructures. We will incorporate artificial monoclonal antibodies and demonstrate these to be a highly sensitive, specific, stable and low-cost biodiagnostic platform. This will be achieved through orientation-controlled molecular imprinting.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will lead to development of simpler and more robust biosensors for detection of multiple important compounds.  This will be achieved by replacing antibodies - complicated, expensive and unstable molecules - with artificial equivalents based on less expensive and more stable materials.  In addition, novel nanotechnology approaches will be used for detection.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project established the theoretical framework and experimental demonstration of plasmonic biosensors based on molecularly imprinted polymers.  The project provided a comprehensive comparison of the sensitivity and stability of plasmonic biosensors based on natural and artificial antibodies.  Although the natural antibody-based plasmonic biosensors exhibited superior sensitivity, their stability (temporal, thermal and chemical) was found to be vastly inferior to those based on artificial antibodies.  Using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, we have unveiled single molecular pair-wise interaction force between artificial (and natural) antibody and antigen.  We found that the rupture force associated with natural antibody and antigen is higher compared to artificial antibody and antigen.  Furthermore, our single molecule force spectroscopy study revealed that the natural antibody-antigen complex exhibited a higher binding stability compared to artificial antibody-antigen complex.  These fine differences at single molecular level manifested into the significantly different biosensing characteristics of plasmonic biosensors based on natural and artificial antibodies.  The AFM-based force spectroscopy-based approach proved to be a powerful tool to rationalize and guide the design of synthetic biorecogniton elements and relevant highly sensitive biosensors for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn an attempt to improve the binding affinity of the artificial antibody and antigen, we have optimized the chemical composition of the imprinted polymer.
