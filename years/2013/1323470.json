 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a network of partner institutions to transform undergraduate chemistry and biology courses by implementing environmental, research-based experiments both across the disciplines and vertically through the curricula, such that students consider a variety of viewpoints to address environmental challenges. The collaboration includes research-intensive Central Michigan University, the predominantly undergraduate Saginaw Valley State University, and the community college Delta College, and leverages existing research partnerships between faculty and regional community partners such as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Bay County Health Department. Through their research projects, students at the three institutions contribute to their communities by providing environmental quality data for local water and soil resources. The goals of the project are to 1) increase interest and skills of students in chemistry and biology, 2) increase real-world relevancy in courses, 3) determine the effects of the vertical curricula and across-discipline design on student outcomes, 4) enhance a two-year community college program by fostering student interactions with four-year institutions, 5) improve undergraduate environmental, chemical, and toxicology research by additional instrumentation and training where emphasis will be placed on teaching students proper sampling methodology and standard analytical techniques, 6) increase data and environmental information for the surrounding communities and areas, and 7) provide a transferable model for other institutions wishing to similarly transform their curricula by creating collaborative networks of institutions. Project evaluators are examining the extent to which these goals are achieved, as well as the facilitating and impeding factors for effective transfer of this model to other institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research resulted in the following findings and outcomes: \n\nNew research-based lab activities were developed and implemented in chemistry and biology courses at three institutions in Mid-Michigan.  The activities were designed to give students experience conducting research on a subject affecting their lives: the quality of the watershed in their environment.  Through the research activities embedded in their courses, students learned traditional science concepts in an applied, hands-on manner.  The project assessed the impacts on students and faculty using qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods including surveys and interviews.  Both survey results and anecdotal instructor observations show that the experiential learning afforded by the research-based labs are valuable.  Student interest in the subject increased, knowledge of environmental concepts increased, and appreciation for the topics? real-world relevancy was significant.  Students liked being able to collect and analyze data in the field in the natural environment while learning traditional concepts.  Impacts on student science motivation and attitudes towards and awareness of environmental issues were also measured.  In many cases, these aspects increased significantly in groups that experienced the research-based labs.  Anecdotally, instructors observed that students in advanced experimental courses who had also taken introductory courses often had notable characteristics.  They retained knowledge about the environmental chemistry from early courses which enabled them to advance further in concepts in the upper level courses.  Their enrollments in the upper level courses was often because of topical interest generated in earlier course experiences.  And several students focused their career paths squarely in an area covered by the research-based laboratory experiments.  Outcomes from this research also include multiple CoPI and student presentations at national and local conferences, undergraduate and graduate student research theses, and manuscripts currently in preparation.  The project enabled collaboration between instructors at the three institutions (a research-intensive university, a predominately undergraduate institution, and a community college) in which the research-based lab activities were shared and modified to suit the different institutional needs.  Students shared findings from their course embedded research projects at an annual student summit meeting open to the public, where they also networked with participants from each institution.  The summit also enhanced the two-year community college program by fostering student interactions with four-year institutions.
