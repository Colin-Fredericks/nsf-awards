 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to introduce and research game-changing approaches for reliable (a) reconfigurable RF front-ends using novel microfluidics that incorporates movable metal-coated quartz pieces within polymer channels to realize parasitic loadings, and (b) flexible electronics into attractive garments with performance similar to their inflexible copper counterparts. The proposed microfluidic reconfiguration concept has never been tried before, and is aimed at overcoming issues with previous microfluidic switching mechanisms that suffer from toxicity and oxidation. Its success is transformative as it will lead to reliable and non-toxic reconfigurations based on widely available materials.  \r\nThe intellectual merit is to research novel microfluidic reconfiguration concepts. Because these concepts have never been considered before, there are challenges relating to their viability, requiring coexistence of several new technologies, including fluidic flow, fabrication of coated quartz particles/pieces, oxidation, fabrication of new channels using composite polymers, material compatibility, repeatability and reliability. The proposed devices are aimed at achieving reliable high speed connectivity, regardless of a person?s position or movement. The broader impact of the proposed reconfigurable textile antennas and RF front-ends is game-changing. It will enable efficient access to the entire radio spectrum and provide for on-demand remote medical monitoring of medical patients, allowing them to stay at home. The realization of this technology provides for a unique opportunity to carry out multidisciplinary research in material science, electrical engineering and textile design/manufacturing. Summer camps for recruiting underrepresented students by introducing undergrad and graduate student projects will be pursued",
