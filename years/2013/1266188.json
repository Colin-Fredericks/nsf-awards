The proposed conference builds on the relevance and applications of stochastic methods applied to non-linear partial differential equations that stem for recent developments in game theory. The keynote speakers  have been confirmed and represent top figures in mathematics. These are: E. DiBenedetto of Vanderbilt University, R.V. Kohn of New York University, L. Mahadevan of Havard University and G. Strang of MIT. Between 30-40 participants are expected to participate in the workshop, the majority of whom will be from outside of the University of Pittsburgh. Special attention will be paid to the recruitment of women and minorities participants.",
