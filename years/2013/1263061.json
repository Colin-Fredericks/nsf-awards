 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site: Arctic and Antarctic CReSIS (AaA-REU) program will involve 75 undergraduates over a three-year period with five pre-service RET students each year. This project is a continuation of the REU Site program that has operated at Elizabeth City State University and other CReSIS (Center for Remote Sensing of the Ice Sheets) institutions since 2010. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.  The vision for this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on the integration of polar research and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into polar-related careers. \r\n \r\nThe AaA-REU project will be interdisciplinary in focus and will make innovative, cost-effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project builds upon existing partnerships in polar science, engineering, education, and cyberinfrastructure -- partnerships that provide access to extensive CReSIS resources under the direction of an experienced team of educators and researchers. It is expected that the demographics of the participants will reflect the exciting minority percentages that were realized during the past CReSIS-REU award.",
