 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of mammalian cells to sense the density of the cells around them (quorum sensing) plays an important role in such fundamental processes as embryogenesis, proliferation and differentiation, and cell migration.  Without quorum sensing a developing embryo would be unable to properly proportion its cells into different tissue types.  Such control requires integrating secreted factors, signal transduction molecules, and cellular machinery.  In mammals, the sheer number of players involved in these processes creates an unwieldy morass of interconnected proteins, making it difficult to study.  This project is designed to untangle this snarl by using the social ameoba, Dictyostelium discoideum, as a model. Dictyostelium cells display many of the characteristics of mammalian cells, including, but not limited to, motility, differentiation, development and cell to cell signaling.  Thus, this protist is an excellent model for mammalian cell behavior, especially quorum sensing.  When starved, Dictyostelium cells will undergo a period of differentiation and development leading to the formation of a multicellular organism.  However, this process will not begin unless there are sufficient numbers of starving cells to form a full sized organism.  Therefore, these cells are able to sense the density of the starving cells around them and respond appropriately.  This project will delineate how three signal transduction molecules (phospholipase Dbeta and the protein kinases TklA and PakD) work together to control changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the decision to develop.  By uncovering the function of these proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum, a better understanding of their roles in quorum sensing in mammalian cells can be gained, and with it, a better understanding of their roles in development.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis project advances discovery while promoting participation of underrepresented groups in the learning process, as Hunter College is a minority serving institution with a 60% female student body.  Underrepresented students and one postdoctoral researcher will be actively engaged in designing, interpreting and presenting experiments.  As part of this project, two lab modules designed to teach genetic analysis to Biology, Biochemistry and Neuroscience majors will be created, implemented and assessed.  The postdoctoral researcher will help design the modules, train the lab instructors and teach students, enabling him to acquire skills in course creation, coordination and lecturing. These lab modules will be disseminated on-line to the broader teaching community (www.dictybase.org), extending the reach to those historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe ability of animal cells to sense the density of cells around them plays an important role in cellular growth control and differentiation.  Without such quorum sensing ability, a developing embryo would be unable to properly proportion its cells into different tissue types.  However, studying quorum sensing in animals is difficult due to their complexity and genetic intractability. The sheer number of players involved in quorum sensing creates an unwieldy morass of interconnected proteins, making the process difficult to study.   Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum) is a relatively simple eukaryote with a small genome (~ 9500 genes), and undergoes many processes that animal cells experience, including differentiation, chemotaxis, morphogenesis, cell signaling and quorum sensing.  Research in D. discoideum has been instrumental in pioneering findings in mammalian cells, especially in understanding the cytoskeleton and signal transduction.  D. discoideum has been designated a model research organism, making our study of quorum sensing in the genetically pliable and biochemically amenable eukaryote D. discoideum of great relevance to the research community.  This project helped to untangle quorum sensing by studying it in the simpler model eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum.\n\nIndividual Dictyostelium cells will undergo development into a multicellular organism when starved.  This requires movement towards the secreted molecule cAMP.  If the cell density is too low, however, the cells will not move.  Thus, development is regulated by cell density.  Cell density is sensed through conditioned medium factor (CMF), a molecule secreted only by starving cells.  CMF concentrations outside of the cell are detected by a receptor on the surface of the cell.  CMF binding to the receptor activates a series of proteins that eventually allows the cells to develop.  This project examined three of those proteins, PkcA, PakD and PldB, all of which have cognates in mammalian cells.  The major goal was to uncover the order of action of these three proteins in quorum sensing.\n\nUsing a combination of genetics and cell biology, we were able to determine that PakD works upstream of PldB.  Through additional biochemistry experiments, we were able to determine that PkcA also works upstream of PldB.  Thus, we have started to unravel the process by which eukaryotic cells are able to sense cell-density.  This work has led to five publications.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nIn addition to the scientific findings, this work formed the basis of a new module for the Molecular Biology course taught at Hunter College.  Hunter College, a minority-serving institution with 60% women in the student body, offers Molecular Biology as the first upper level biology courses taken by Biology majors, Chemistry majors in the Biochemistry track, and Psychology majors in the Behavioral Neurosciences track (roughly 180 students/year).  One concept in molecular biology that students find particularly difficult to grasp is epistasis analysis and how it can be used to order proteins in a biological pathway.  As this is an important tool used by biologists to study a wide range of cellular functions, it is imperative that the students acquire a keen understanding of epistasis analysis.  To aid in this, we used the quorum sensing mutants in pakD, tklA and pldB to develop an epistasis analysis lab module.  We found that the module made epistasis analysis more accessible to students.\n\nThis project has led to the diversification of the STEM field through the training of 10 high school students, 4 undergraduates, 4 graduate students and 1 post-doctoral researcher.  Of the 19 people trained, 8 were women and 8 were from underrepresented groups.  All of the high school students went on to college in STEM degrees. Five of them are authors on two different publications from this work.  The undergraduates all graduated with degrees in Biological Sciences and have either gone on to graduate or professional schools, or are working in a STEM field.  One of these students is an author on a publication form this work.  Two of the graduate students have earned their PhD degrees.  The other two are still pursuing their degrees.  Two of these students are the primary authors on two separate publications.  The post-doctoral researcher has gone on to a university teaching job in Biology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Derrick Brazill"
