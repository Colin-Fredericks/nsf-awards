 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe ice dynamics and tectonic history of Ice-covered regions are poorly understood. Scientific investigations of these regions are hindered by extreme weather and complex logistical support. The PIs propose development of a new, rapid deployment, dense footprint, seismic observatory for ice-covered regions, the Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice-Covered Environments (GEOICE). This seismic array will provide increased observational capabilities and logistical efficiencies needed to seismically image the structures and dynamic behavior of both the solid Earth and overlying ice in remote ice-covered regions. The GEOICE's components will be designed to withstand icy and/or wet environments and require minimal logistics. Research enabled by GEOICE includes: ice mass and sea level changes, solid earth structure, tectonics and ice sheet stability, and deep Earth structure and processes.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nGEOICE will provide a community tool for achieving a better understanding of the Earth's rapidly changing polar and ice-covered regions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2007 report concluded that poor understanding of glacial dynamics prohibits robust estimates of future sea-level. GEOICE will enable research that helps address this societally relevant issue. Simplified logistics enabled by GEOICE could lower the technical and logistical barriers that hinder young investigators in the polar regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments  (GEOICE) was a project supported by the National Science Foundation to  develop a pool of seismic instruments that were specially designed for  use in Earth?s ice-covered regions.  The project, which began in 2013,  lasted approximately five years and resulted in a state-of-the-art pool  of seismometers and ancillary equipment that will allow scientists to  make detailed recordings of earthquakes beneath the ice, as well as  icequakes, glacial calving events, and other ice-related phenomena.   GEOICE was made possible by a unique collaboration between glacial  seismologists at Central Washington University, seismic engineers at the  IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center at New Mexico Institute of Mining and  Technology (NMT), and management staff from the Incorporated Research  Institutions for Seismology (IRIS).  Together, these three groups  brought the necessary expertise in seismology, instrumentation, and  execution to see the project through to a successful conclusion.  The  resulting GEOICE pool of seismic equipment could not come at a more  opportune time as both seismologists and society have developed an  increasing interest in the rapid changes now occurring in Earth's polar  regions.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nWhile scientists today are fortunate to have seismic sensors  installed all over the Earth, the polar regions remain more sparsely  instrumented than elsewhere.  This has direct impacts on the ability of  seismologists to detect events happening in these regions, and also  limits the quantity and types of observations that can be made for large  earthquakes anywhere on Earth.  For instance, when a large earthquake  happens anywhere on the planet (e.g., California) the seismic waves  travel through the Earth and are recorded by seismometers worldwide.   The more observations we can make of those waves the more we can learn  about the paths the waves have traveled through the Earth, which informs  our understanding of Earth structure.\n\nBeyond recording distant earthquakes, seismometers in polar regions  have proven vital to recording the significant changes these regions are  seeing in a warming climate.  In recent years, seismometers have  produced spectacular recordings of calving glaciers in Greenland,  tsunami-tossed icebergs in Antarctica, and the effects of melting of ice  sheets and glaciers worldwide.  Even for ice-covered regions that are  not currently experiencing dramatic changes, the GEOICE equipment pool  allows scientists to create an important record that can be compared  against any changes in the future.\n\nThe instrumentation array developed and built as part of the GEOICE  project incorporates decades of lessons learned from earlier attempts to  record earthquakes and related phenomena in ice-covered regions. For  example, the GEOICE array is designed to be easily transported to some  of the most remote locations on Earth, a significant improvement over  earlier generations of seismic sensors.  Once on-site, the sensors  themselves are built to withstand extreme cold (&lt;-40 C) and can  operate while submerged within the water of a melting glacier.  The sensors require significantly less power than typical  seismometers, allowing scientists to deploy them with fewer batteries,  or for longer periods of time, while still gathering high-quality data.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe highly-specialized pool of seismic equipment produced by the  GEOICE project provides the entire scientific community with a  specialized tool for studying the Earth's rapidly changing polar and  ice-covered regions.  The GEOICE pool contains 3 different types of  seismic sensors: 10 larger broadband sensors for recording distant  sources, 55 smaller intermediate period? sensors for more recording of  regional sources, and 200 small nodal sensors for dense deployments  studying nearby sources.  The sensors themselves are housed at and  maintained by the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center at NMT, funded by NSF  under the SAGE award (Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of  Geoscience).  There, expert staff maintain the equipment and  make it available for free use by any scientist funded by the National  Science Foundation.  In this way, the GEOICE equipment is a true  community resource, able to be used by a variety of scientists (e.g.  seismologists, glaciologists, meteorologists, etc.) who wish to conduct  scientific studies in Earth's ice-covered regions.  The lessons learned  during the GEOICE project have been and continue to be shared with the  broader scientific community through scientific conferences, meetings,  and publications.  Through the partnership with the IRIS PASSCAL  Instrument Center at NMT, several geophysics graduate students have been  involved with the project gaining valuable experience with seismic  instrumentation, and enhancing the knowledge of the next generation of  scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Winberry"
