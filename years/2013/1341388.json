 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program provides a unique professional development opportunity for K-12 educators to inform national STEM policy and improve communication between the STEM education community and national leaders.  Albert Einstein Fellows spend eleven months working at the National Science Foundation, bringing extensive knowledge and classroom experience to STEM education programs.  In addition, fellows are provided with an extensive program of professional development training during their cohort year.  The Albert Einstein Fellows program is run by the non-profit Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education on behalf of the Department of Energy Office of Science.  Other federal participants in the fellowship program include NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Congress. In 2013-14, NSF will host seventeen Albert Einstein Fellows.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Einstein Fellows program is designed to provide substantial STEM work experience beyond the confines of the classroom, as well as extensive training in the individual fields of science, technology, and engineering, STEM education policy, and STEM program outcomes.  During the eleven-month fellowship, the Triangle Coalition provides programming that supports professional development in three broad goal areas:  1) development of leadership skills; 2) development as a STEM educator; and, 3) addressing grand challenges in STEM education.  The Triangle Coalition engages a third-party evaluator to measure the efficacy of the professional development programming and the overall impact of the program.  The evaluators will collect and analyze data that addresses the cumulative impact of the Albert Einstein Fellows program upon the participants and STEM programs with which they engage.  The analysis will provide insight into fellows' diversity of experiences post-fellowship that can inform program analyses and research into STEM issues such as resource allocation, teacher preparedness, student interest, and minority participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellows Program advances knowledge of STEM disciplines and the critical role educators play in advancing STEM learning and career development.  The program increases STEM knowledge and pedagogical skills, provides an opportunity for building leadership capabilities as STEM experts, and assists educators with understanding the policy process.  The fellowship equips educators to be STEM capacity-builders and problem-solvers for social, economic, and political challenges created or exacerbated by lack of STEM comprehension.  The program also encourages broader diversity in STEM by recruiting in demographic sectors (race, ethnicity, location, etc.) that are historically underrepresented.",
