 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Rhode Island Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is recruiting undergraduate STEM majors and STEM professional career changers who might otherwise not have considered a career in K-12 teaching and supporting them through their induction years. Specifically, this project supports 20 undergraduate STEM majors and 5 STEM professionals over 5 years. These scholars are being prepared to teach elementary, middle, and high school students in high-need school districts. In addition, 50 freshman and sophomores will be afforded paid summer internships in STEM education areas. This project collaborates with five Rhode Island school districts as well as non-profit organizations. \r\n\r\nThis project extends STEM teacher education in two ways, both having transformative intellectual merit. First, using a model based on the results of state K-12 science assessments, diverse and highly effective field placement sites are being selected. Secondly, the Purposeful Ongoing Mentoring Model is being implemented to train cooperating teachers as mentors for Noyce Scholars during student teaching. This model is also being implemented to support Noyce Scholars as new teachers during their first 3 years of teaching. Evaluative aspects of this project will address the factors influencing STEM majors and STEM professionals to enter K-12 teaching, factors influencing their interest in working in urban schools, and factors leading to successful internships.\r\n\r\nBesides providing well-prepared STEM teachers for high-need school districts in Rhode Island, the broader impacts of this project center on advancing discovery and understanding of successful recruitment and teacher training in K-12 mathematics and science. Plans are in place for sharing significant findings via presentations and publications. This project also has implications for workforce development in Rhode Island, a state facing a significant economic transition and one in which STEM training and STEM teaching at the K-12 level are likely to play a significant future role.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of our program were to 1) recruit 50 freshmen and sophomores with STEM backgrounds and STEM professionals into teacher education, 2) support 20 undergraduates with STEM backgrounds and 5 STEM professionals in teacher education (25 total), and 3) mentor URI Robert Noyce Scholars as new teachers in high-need school districts.\n\nThe University of Rhode Island met each of these goals.  We recruited 46 freshmen and sophomores who worked in paid summer internships in informal science and mathematics settings.  Seven of them became Noyce Scholars.  We prepared and supported 25 new STEM teachers--18 STEM undergraduates and 7 STEM professionals--in our elementary and secondary teacher education programs.  We also mentored 17 of these Noyce Scholars as new teachers in high-need school districts.  Four more Noyce Scholars are beginning their first year of teaching this academic year.\n\nWe collaborated with Rhode Island public schools in Central Falls, Newport, Providence, and West Warwick, as well as the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, Center for Dynamic Learning, Providence Boys and Girls Club, Providence Children?s Museum, Roger Williams Park Zoo, and Save the Bay.\n\nTwenty-one (84%) of our Noyce Scholars are teaching science or mathematics to hundreds of students in high-need school districts in five states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.  Two Noyce Scholars are completing their teacher preparation/student teaching.  Two Noyce Scholars are pursuing Master?s degrees.  Only one of our Noyce Scholars did not complete the teacher preparation program.  This award also supported 10 Noyce Scholars through professional development at four regional, three national, and one international conferences.\n\nFindings from this project were disseminated at seven regional, one national, and four international peer-reviewed conferences.  Additionally, we were invited to present at 14 national and regional conferences.  Three abstracts were also published.  One book chapter is forthcoming (Seitsinger et al., 2020); it describes what we learned from the preparation and mentoring of our Noyce Scholars.  In the chapter, we noted that highly-qualified teachers with strong STEM backgrounds are needed to teach children, particularly in high-need school districts.  Our university?s teacher preparation program used a constructivist approach to build candidates? technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge to enhance their preparation to teach in classrooms where they are expected to utilize instructional technology effectively.  Yet, teacher preparation programs prepare candidates to a certain degree.  Beginning teachers continue to need support.  We reported on how prepared these new STEM teachers were to teach and the challenges they faced in high-need school districts.  We also discussed the instructional technology provided to them from a federal grant to address some of these challenges.  The chapter concludes that beginning STEM teachers benefit from induction supports that a) provide university-based mentoring, b) allow them to continue to use strategies and technologies they had access to during their teacher preparation program, and c) continue to develop themselves as professionals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Seitsinger"
