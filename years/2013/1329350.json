 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis project is directed towards developing new methods for optimizing production of useful compounds by genetically engineered bacteria. In typical industrial settings, large scale production is fraught with reduced efficiency and yield of desired compounds. The problem is that an industrially useful compound may not be useful for the bacteria, and so there is selective pressure against \"producer cells\" and for \"non-producer cells\" which can then overwhelm the population. To address this problem, a strategy called Programmed Evolution has been created, which will introduce genetic variation into bacterial populations and reward cells for producing the largest amount of compound. This project aims to investigate this optimization process using a mathematical approach in order to gain a better understanding as to how the cells reach their final evolved state. Programmed Evolution will be a plug-and-play system for the optimization of any desired output so researchers and companies can produce the most compound possible for applications in energy, and bioremediation. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThe Programmed Evolution project will increase diversity for STEM education since the research is conducted entirely by undergraduates. The investigators will continue their successful model of recruiting students from underrepresented groups. The project will contribute to a trained STEM workforce because the students involved will be highly valued as a result of their authentic research experiences. The Programmed Evolution process could improve efficiencies for industrial-scale commercial production of useful chemicals and pharmaceuticals, thus improving American economic competitiveness. In addition to strengthening the infrastructure for research and education on the two collaborating campuses, the project will enable the investigators to continue to serve as national leaders in undergraduate synthetic biology education and research through the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT). The project will enhance the undergraduate education of the students, contribute to their development as scientifically literate citizens, and provide them with the background needed to pursue research careers. As the undergraduate students learn how to program the evolution of bacteria, they also learn how to program the course of their own futures as professionals, educators, and research scientists.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

Programmed Evolution calls for the introduction of genotypic variation in the control elements of genetic circuits that control a metabolic pathway, selection of bacteria that have optimized metabolic output, measurement of the metabolic output with biosensors, and detection of changes in the frequency of genotypes in the bacterial population. We completed a proof-of-concept for Programmed Evolution that optimized the conversion of caffeine to theophylline, but future applications of Programmed Evolution will require the discovery of new synthetic riboswitches. Researchers have published very few riboswitches that function reliably in cells and can be used in Programmed Evolution. This led us to develop a new in vivo method for riboswitch discovery called Cell-based EXponential enrichment, or CellEX. CellEX encompasses the production of a library of riboswitches followed by negative and positive selection to find riboswitches with new ligand specificity. We generated preliminary data that supported the feasibility of CellEX, but were unable to discover new riboswitches with the method. We think that the reason we were not been able to discover new riboswitches with CellEX is that it is not able to search a large enough sequence space. To address this problem, we turned our attention to a new approach called Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE). PACE uses M13 bacteriophage to explore very large sequence spaces. We developed a mathematical model of PACE using agent-based modeling software called NetLogo. We conducted a xanthine riboswitch discovery PACE experiment using an existing theophylline translational riboswitch and an existing theophylline transcriptional riboswitch. Our data indicate that the translational riboswitch changed by deletion of 7 bases during the experiment, demonstrating evolution. We are testing the function of the new riboswitch, and are pursuing next generation sequencing to discover others.
