 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how individual scientists interact with one another and how such interaction impacts research productivity and knowledge diffusion is important for understanding the dynamics of scientific research collaboration.  At the same time, information about patterns of collaboration and their consequences have implications for science policy. In quantitative research on collaboration networks, publication co-authorships and citation-linkages have been the primary source of data. As large data repositories, one of the signposts for cyberinfrastructure-enabled, data-driven science, become increasingly prevalent, however, they offer an alternative source of information about networks of scientific collaboration. This project investigates research collaboration networks emerging around one such international data repository, GenBank, and develops data products to support data-driven science policymaking and research.  By utilizing this novel data source the project provides an unprecedented opportunity to validate and expand the theory of complex networks while generating rich data outputs and products to support science policy research and policymaking. This study fills a number of theoretical and methodological gaps identified by the 2008 roadmap for Science of Science Policy (SoSP), with a specific focus on how scientific collaboration networks form and evolve. The outcomes of this study address the lack of models and tools for network analysis, visual analytics, and science mapping outlined in the 2008 roadmap for SoSP. To accomplish the data collection and processing required for this project new computational programs will be developed to parse, extract, store, transform, split, merge, and filter the data; these will be applicable to the analysis of other similar data sources for science policy and innovation research. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts. By making available dataset product prototypes the project will allow researchers, policy makers, and students to explore research networks in GenBank from longitudinal, thematic, geographical, institutional, and author dimensions. The multi-dimensional, interactive presentations of such datasets enable data-intensive science policy research and support science policymaking through filtering, sorting, associating, and visualization capabilities. The datasets and data products will be made available through an open access mechanism, so educators and undergraduate and graduate students have ample opportunities to use these resources for teaching and research. Students enrolled in Syracuse University's newly established Certificate for Advanced Study in Data Science (CAS DS) program will be able to participate in the project and gain skills in programming for data collection and processing, data quality verification, analysis, and visualization. In addition, the collaboration network analysis provides interested doctoral students an opportunity to do independent study or dissertation research. Findings from studying cyberinfrastructure-supported data sharing and knowledge diffusion is expected to advance policymakers' ability to properly assess the outcomes of federally funded research.",

Examining genetic sequence data submissions and associated publications side by side provides a new perspective on how cyberinfrastructure-enabled collaboration networks have contributed to the advances of data-intensive biology. The resulting datasets, computational code, data products, and methodological workflows demonstrate the feasibility of this novel data source for science policy research and can be shared and reused through depositing to an open data repository. The resulting datasets made it possible for future research to incorporate other data sources (e.g., funding, taxonomy) to perform data-driven science policy research.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The results from this project led to the development of a new metric framework for measuring the impact of cyberinfrastructure-enabled scientific capacity on the extent and rate of knowledge diffusion. This framework uses collaboration capacity as the proxy measure for scientific capacity, in which the ability to garner a large data production team will have impact on the extent and rate of knowledge diffusion. It is assumed that a high level of scientific capacity can accelerate the extent of knowledge diffusion while a low level can hinder knowledge diffusion. Collaboration capacity as a proxy of scientific capacity can be operationalized by data submission network features, including the sizes and distribution patterns of data submission networks, core and peripheral positions of nodes, temporal features, and taxonomic features, and can be cross-examined through publication and patent data. This novel framework for measuring the impact of cyberinfrastructure-enabled collaboration on the extent and rate of knowledge diffusion represents a unique contribution to the knowledge of scientometric and science policy research.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The fact that the data source contained information about dataset and associated research publications allows the study to establish a grand picture over a period of almost two decades, during which time the cyberinfrastructure was shaping up by the advances in information technology and biotechnology. The longitudinal data on genetic sequence submissions to the GenBank repository coupled with associated publications reveal some very interesting phenomena that have policy implications to science research and are worth further exploration by integrating data from other sources such as workforce, economic indicators, R&amp;D expenditures, funding, and major social and political events that may have impacted the rise and/or fall of scientific capacity and hence the output of scientific production.</p>\n<p>Key outcomes from this project include:</p>\n<p>1) &nbsp;This project computed statistical characteristics of research networks and visualized network characteristics through data tables, power law graphs, degree distribution charts, and network structures by year.
