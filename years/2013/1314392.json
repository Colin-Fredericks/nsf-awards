 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards funds the Physics TheoryNet outreach program coordinated by Professors Tomasz R. Taylor and Brent D. Nelson at Northeastern University in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe main component of Physics TheoryNet is direct interaction between Greater Boston area theoretical physicists and high-school students, through lecture presentations, demonstrations and question-and-answer sessions during regular class hours and after classes. Presentation topics include physics in the news (such as dark energy or the Large Hadron Collider), traditional subjects of interest to young science students (such as black holes, time travel or extra dimensions), or concepts related to the high-school physics curriculum. The program also promotes physics as a field of study when students go on to college. Teachers and physicists gather each semester at Northeastern University to arrange visits, share experiences and develop a learning community.   The TheoryNet program also has a broader impact on Greater Boston area communities by increasing students' understanding of science and raising the awareness of the importance of fundamental research.",
