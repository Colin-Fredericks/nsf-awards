 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors Carla Mattos and Patricia A Mabrouk, both at Northeastern University. The REU site in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology (CCB) at Northeastern University will be centered on the theme of catalysis and will include perspectives from both chemical and biological systems. Nine undergraduate students will participate in the program each year, with priority given to those from institutions that do not have graduate programs and that graduate large numbers of students from underrepresented groups in the sciences. Each student will join a research group in CCB and will be paired with a Northeastern undergraduate and a graduate student in the group, where he/she will perform experiments that will involve some aspect of catalysis in research. The theme on catalysis will be introduced at the opening day and reinforced through weekly faculty seminars and a final presentation by the students. During the summer each student will write a statement of mutual expectation with the mentor, put together an electronic portfolio and prepare a poster to be presented at a national conference during the following year. Over the three years of the project, a total of 27 students will have the opportunity to do summer research full time at Northeastern with a diverse group of research-active faculty highly experienced in mentoring undergraduates. The mentoring relationships will be maintained with each student throughout the remainder of their undergraduate years.",

The students were selected following a widely advertised call for applications via a dedicated website, through various online internship and research employment portals, and by directly soliciting colleagues in other institutions. Over the three years, we received 522 applications (219 male and 303 female applicants). The 28 participants were from institutions other than Northeastern University, 21 (primarily undergraduate) institutions without chemistry graduate programs. <strong>Our REU group included 17 women, 15 students from ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, 14 second-year students, and 1 student from an associate degree-granting institution</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We maintained contact with 25 of the 28 participants through an annual update survey. 20 of the 25 respondents have earned their bachelor&rsquo;s degree and <strong>19 are either enrolled in Ph.D. programs or working in a science-related field including biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and healthcare consulting</strong>. In all, 13 alumni of our REU program are currently enrolled in Ph.D. programs (Table 1). We encouraged our participants to present their research at a national conference and provided travel funds to support this. Of the 28 participants, <strong>19 presented at a major conference</strong> (American Chemical Society National or American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). Because we understood that many of the students had not previously attended or presented at a major conference, they trave met up with their Northeastern members at the conference. Several students also presented their work at other meetings including 2 students who were nominated by us and selected to present at the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium organized by the Council on Undergraduate Research. Three students are co-authors on papers submitted to or published in peer-reviewed journals (Table 2) and another 3 students will be co-authors on papers to be submitted within the next year.</p>\n<p>This achievement profile of the participants speaks to the effectiveness of our program in providing hands-on research experience, professional development and career planning, opportunities for engagement with the broader scientific community, and mentorship from faculty and graduate students, especially considering that <strong>41% of the students came to us without any research experience</strong>. Students were not only paired with a faculty advisor but also with a graduate student from the same research laboratory who served as the REU student&rsquo;s secondary mentor. The graduate student mentors participated in a formal mentor training program that began before the REU students arrived and continued throughout the summer. The role of the graduate student mentor was to serve as a readily available resource to the REU student and to help foster their prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s integration into the research group, understanding and ownership of the research project, and overall development as a scientist. The graduate student mentors were also perceptibly involved in several of the professional workshops and almost all of the social events organized for the REU students with the primary goal that doing this would help cultivate an atmosphere of belonging and inclusiveness for the REU students. The involvement of graduate students as formal mentors is a unique aspect of our program, one that the graduate students and the REU students found to be mutually beneficial and particularly rewarding. Students in the program participated in a research seminar series presented once a week and a variety of professional development activities. Each student gave an oral presentation on the last day of the program at a department-wide research symposium. The students prepared for this finale by attending the research presentation workshop and, mid-way through the summer, preparing a short presentation on the background of their project and attending a one-on-one practice and consultation session with Dr. Oyelaran.

Upon exit, students reported that they were enthusiastically satisfied with their summer experience, with consistently high rankings for most of the professional development workshops, especially those with one-on-one sessions, the company visits, and their interaction with their respective graduate student mentor. Data from the URSSA survey show that <strong>students self-reported gains across the board</strong>, with significant increase in their understanding of the connections between scientific disciplines and how to (i) keep a detailed lab notebook, (ii) conduct observations in the lab or field, (iii) conduct database searches, (iv) understand journal articles, and (v) figure out the next step in a research project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carla&nbsp;Mattos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262734/1262734_10252491_1506695140485_REU_students_with_PI_CarlaMattos--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262734/1262734_10252491_1506695140485_REU_students_with_PI_CarlaMattos--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2015 REU students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262734/1262734_10252491_1506695140485_REU_students_with_PI_CarlaMattos--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2015 REU students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Foto at BBQ at the department chair's house - REU students and PI Carla Mattos (center)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oyinda Oyelaran (Program Director)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carla&nbsp;Mattos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2015 REU students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
