 "awd_abstract_narration": "By supporting graduate students to attend IEEE SECON 2013, this award will increase the dissemination\r\nof the conference research results to a larger and a more diverse audience, which otherwise\r\nwould not have been able to attend. In so doing, this award will contribute to the strength\r\nand inclusiveness of the research community, and will lead to the long-term health and vitalization\r\nof SECON. In addition, by giving preference in grant awards to women and under-represented\r\nstudents, it is hoped that it will increase the participation among these groups. By advertising to a wide\r\nrange of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should\r\nbe able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad and diverse population is key to\r\nthe health of the research community.\r\n\r\nConference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities\r\nfor students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference,\r\nthis project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves\r\nbenefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable\r\nsetting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas.\r\nThe research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and\r\nfrom the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from\r\nthe increased diversity of participants attending the conference.",
