The goals of this planning grant are to: 1) Determine the current and future bioenergy workforce need in a 12 state Midwest region; 2) Identify the colleges serving this need or wanting to serve this need; 3) Determine additional educational resources required to meet current and future need; 4) Identify how the Bioenergy Technology Education Center could support colleges serving the bioenergy industry; and 5) Determine what partner resources and management systems are needed in order to sustain an ATE Regional Center.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-conceived planning grant that could potentially lead to a Center that focuses on a growing industry. The development of alternative fuels, especially biofuels, could be an important economic resource in the near future.",

As a part of the grant, suveys were conducted of both bioenergy industries and community colleges to understand what the industry's workforce training needs were and the resources that are in place to meet those needs.  This project culminated in a Partner  Summit that brought together representatives from community colleges, workforce development, government agencies, universities, other NSF regional centers, and industry to review the survey results and determine if there is a need for a coordinated bioenergy education/training center for the uper Midwest.\n\nEmployer Survey\n\nA total of 36 companies responded to the survey representing over 100 bioenergy plants.  Although 55% of employers responded that they saw no change in technician-level employment in their industry, 42% saw a future need to increase the number of employed technicians.  Only 3% saw a decreasing need for technicians in the future.  Given new technological advances in the industry, 76% of employers said technicians will need new skills including an \"understanding new process technologies\" and \"skills to perform analytical quality assurance\" or other analytical procedures.\n\nTo find qualified technicians, 63% of employers look to educational institutions, with 82% of those looking to community and technical colleges, 41% looking to, or also to, four-year institutions and 9% looking to a local high school.  Twenty-three percent responded that they hire only experienced technicians from other plants, from venders and from in-house promotions.  Only 14% said that they had no requirements for employment.\n\nWhen asked to design the ideal training program, employers listed five critical areas of study that should be emphasized:\n\n41% referenced Basic Chemistry and Laboratory Techniques\n\n25% listed Process Control, Operating Systems, Fermentation Basics, Distillation\n\n25% listed Safety\n\n17% listed General Plant Operations or Processes, Production Chemistry, or Specific Laboratory Equipment\n\n17% included Biology or Chemical Engineering\n\n14% noted Troubleshooting, QA/QC, Business, Economics, Logistics, Water Treatment\n\nCommunity College Survey\n\nInitially, surveys were sent to 74 colleges and a total of 59 were resent a couple months later.\n\nA total of 21 responses were collected from colleges. Forty eight percent (48%) indicated they offer courses or a degree related to bioenergy.  Of the 52% that did not offer courses or a degree, 70% indicated interest in offerings. \n\nOf the responders, 80% indicated bioenergy producers were located in their areas but did not provide data as to numbers of technicians.  Several indicated that they did not know, so they could not provide data.\n\nSixty-two percent (81%) indicated that there were other providers of training in their area, other colleges or plant operation companies.  Minnesota West was listed twice as a provider.\n\nEighty one percent (81%) indicated interest in participating in a regional NSF BTEC Center.  All others did not answer the question; no one responded \"no\".\n\nTo the question \"what assistance could be offered by a Regional Center,\" responses included:\n\n        (In Rank Order - 0 to 35 Scale)\n\nInstructor workshops                    35\n\nStudent internships                      31\n\nShared curriculum                        29\n\nJoint curriculum development    27\n\nInstructor internships                   27\n\nStudent scholarships                   27\n\nWeb resources                             27\n\nEquipment acquisition                25\n\nStudent associations                  23\n\nStudent publications                  19\n\nJuried electronic library             19\n\nNewsletter                                    17\n\nPartner Summit\n\nThe BTEC Partner Summit was held at Iowa\u00c6s Honey Creek Resort on Lake Rathbun, June 23-25, 2014.
