The observations will be used to constrain atmospheric models of L- and other brown dwarfs, and to determine what fraction of substellar objects have protoplanetary accretion disks within 15 million years of the substellar objects? formation.  The project?s main goals are to greatly improve our knowledge of the properties of young brown dwarfs, help constrain their origins, and observationally constrain the prospects for planet formation around brown dwarfs via their disk lifetimes.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include bringing research into undergraduate STEM-related classes, press-releases, and training undergraduate students in research.\r\n",

Our mission was to uncover a large, statistically<br />useful and representative sample of young objects ranging in mass from<br />stars a few tenths the mass of the Sun down to the deuterium-burning<br />limit of about 13 Jupiter masses, down to the regime of planets.<br />Identification and characterization of a large sample of such objects<br />can help answer the questions: how can young low-mass stars and<br />substellar objects be identified using their spectra alone? how long<br />do planet-forming disks of gas and dust survive around young low-mass<br />stars and brown dwarfs?&nbsp; do brown dwarfs form fundamentally<br />differently from low-mass stars? is the distribution of masses of<br />low-mass stars and brown dwarfs similar from one star-forming region<br />to another? The two regions surveyed - called Lower Centaurus-Crux<br />(LCC) and Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL) - are large regions of the<br />southern sky that include many of the brightest stars in the<br />constellations Crux (\"the Southern Cross\"), Centaurus, and Lupus.<br />There is a large populations of thousands of stars with ages between<br />approximately 5 and 25 million years old in these regions (mean age<br />approximately 16 million years), lying approximately 300 to 500 light<br />years from Earth. The most massive members of those groups are hot,<br />white-blue, short-lived, massive luminous stars making up some of the<br />brightest stars in those constellations (e.g. Acrux, Mimosa, Hadar,<br />etc.). Recent surveys using X-rays and proper motions have yielded<br />hundreds of lower mass stars similar in mass to the Sun. However to<br />find the lowest mass stars in the group, and those so low in mass that<br />they will never stably burn hydrogen (\"brown dwarfs\", or \"substellar<br />objects\" or \"failed stars\"), we need to use the new multi-CCD Dark<br />Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo<br />Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile to survey nearly 90 square<br />degrees. After a challenging effort to reduce and analyze these data,<br />our survey identified a few hundred new candidate young low-mass stars<br />and brown dwarfs in the UCL and LCC groups, the first isolated<br />examples yet found in these groups. Our initial spectroscopic<br />observations of the first dozen objects have shown that our selection<br />by colors, brightnesses, and motions was extremely efficient, so we<br />are confident that most of these few hundred objects are actually bona<br />fide members of UCL and LCC. We also found that a surprisingly large<br />fraction of these objects (more than 30%) still appear to have<br />retained circumtsellar disks by age 15 million years, suggesting that<br />the material for forming planets is still orbiting these low-mass<br />objects by this age. These planet-forming disks appear to persist<br />sysematically longer around the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs<br />compared to Sun-like stars or the most massive stars in the group,<br />indicating a longer, more protracted epoch for planet formation.&nbsp; Our<br />spectroscopic survey of these candidates should yield the largest<br />spectral library of low-mass objects with ages between 10 and 20<br />million years old, and characterization of these specta will help in<br />the identification of isolated examples of young low-mass stars and<br />brown dwarfs. This project has helped in the training of two graduate<br />students and three undergraduate students (via the REU summer research<br />program), their education on STEM topics such as observing with<br />telescopes, data analysis, calibration, and statistics, and training<br />to be the next generation of scientists. The results from this work<br />were disseminated in PhD theses, refereed papers, research<br />presentations and posters, and talks for the public.
