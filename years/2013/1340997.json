The 6-month planning period includes the following activities: assessing network infrastructure needs driven by science and education activities on campus; defining partnerships and collaborations on campus and elsewhere to create leveraging opportunities and help define those opportunities; and develop a complete plan documenting design, re-architecting, and implementation of an improved campus network that includes the science DMZ concept. Wittenberg University  will also host a \"campus CI\" day. The activity creates the opportunity to make the most of existing infrastructure, both locally and regionally, and in turn enhance research capabilities internally and with partners outside the institution.",
