 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are\r\noften caused by the storage system, because the gap between storage device\r\nand CPU speeds is greater than in any other part of the machine.  Big data\r\nand new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are\r\nstill optimized for legacy workloads and hard disks.  The team at Stony\r\nBrook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that\r\nlarge systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases\r\ncomputing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's\r\nenergy independence.\r\n\r\nFirst, the team is examining modern workloads running on a variety of\r\nplatforms, including individual computers, large compute farms, and a\r\nnext-generation infrastructure, such as Stony Brook's Reality Deck, a\r\nmassive gigapixel visualization facility.  These workloads produce combined\r\nperformance and energy traces that are being released to the community.\r\n\r\nSecond, the team is applying techniques such as statistical feature\r\nextraction, Hidden Markov Modeling, data-mining, and conditional likelihood\r\nmaximization to analyze these data sets and traces.  The Reality Deck is\r\nused to visualize the resulting multi-dimensional performance/energy data\r\nsets.  The team's analyses reveal fundamental phenomena and principles that\r\ninform future designs.\r\n\r\nThird, the findings from the first two efforts are being combined to develop\r\nnew storage architectures that best balance performance and energy under\r\ndifferent workloads when used with modern devices, such as solid-state\r\ndrives (SSDs), phase-change memories, etc.  The designs leverage the team's\r\nwork on storage-optimized algorithms, multi-tier storage, and new optimized\r\ndata structures.",
