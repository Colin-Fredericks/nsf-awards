 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to recruit and retain to transfer or completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees academically capable students with financial need. The focus of the project is to enable scholarship students to attend full-time and to complete their STEM programs reliably in two years. The students are being supported by the STEM Emporium at the college, a program designed to increase completions in STEM majors by supplying out-of-classroom academic support. The student scholars are also supported by many established student support groups that supply experienced and focused support for student sub-populations. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is providing scholarship recipients full opportunities and resources to stay in a STEM major, to focus on courses and not be distracted by working and financially supporting themselves, to attend full-time, and to engage with faculty and cohort students. The scholars are benefiting from an array of support services that includes faculty mentors, dedicated counselors, academic tutoring, and services to aid students who are transferring to universities or who wish to obtain career-track internships or research opportunities. A diverse group of faculty members, who are knowledgeable about population subgroups and serve as role models, are mentoring the students. The scholarships are increasing the academic success of students, rates of completion, transfer to universities, and career readiness. In addition, the program is offering students optional research opportunities that are traditionally available only to students at four-year universities by partnering with universities that provide access to advanced laboratories, instrumentation, and personnel. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is improving the retention of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM professions, thus increasing the economic and racial diversity in STEM graduates and transfer students, and narrowing socioeconomic gaps. Students are learning job skills and gaining confidence for employment through enrichment activities such as faculty mentoring and optional internships. By recruiting and drawing students from local high schools and partnering with private sector companies, the project is giving at-risk students a financially rewarding pathway in STEM careers to which they otherwise might not have been exposed or motivated to pursue.",

Below are some takeaways from working on the grant in the past 6 years.\n Recruiting applicants\n\n \nWe had difficulty recruiting students for our scholarship due to the limitations of the scholarship.  In order to apply, students are required to demonstrate financial need, apply with a 2.7 GPA, and be full-time.  We feel that although this is reasonable for a traditional student attending a 4-year institution, this is not the case with the population of students attending Foothill.  In order to recruit a larger and more diverse population, we would have to be more flexible with the requirements of the scholarship, accepting, for example, students who were not enrolled full-time and finding alternative methods to FAFSA for identifying students with financial need.\n Amount awarded to students\nOur college is located in a high cost of living area, and many of our students are supporting themselves and their families financially.  We have had many students not meet the academic requirements because they were unable to reduce their work hours.  We feel that our award of $1400/quarter was insufficient  to relieve their financial burden.  In order to make a more meaningful impact, we believe that the program would be more effective if we were to offer fewer scholarships with larger monetary amounts.  With a larger dollar amount, we believe that students would dedicate more time to their academic goals and would reap greater rewards.\n Math completion\nOne of the application requirements was for students to have passed Math 48A, the first class in the precalculus sequence.  This requirement was based on our sense that participation in the precalculus sequence best demonstrates a student\u2019s intention to pursue a STEM major.  We were surprised to learn through Institutional research that many of our applicants received their first scholarship disbursement 4 or more quarters after taking Math 48A.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rosa Nguyen"
