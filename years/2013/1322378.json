 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168 foot general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\n\r\n The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the\r\nBermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The RV Atlantic Explorer has 149 days funded in 2013, all of which are for NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\r\n\r\n\tFume Hood \t$20,075\r\n\tTransmissometer\t$7,600\r\n\tVan Veen Grab\t$5,525\r\n\t\t$33,200\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
