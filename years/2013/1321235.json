The topic of the collaboration is to use stochastically generated material properties in numerical simulations of advanced lab tests of asphalt concrete.  The numerical simulations will address the variability of material properties.  The use of stochastic modeling will allow consideration of the actual characteristics of the microstructure and its impact on the response of the material. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will also develop a framework for students to engage in international research and exchanges.  In addition to the academic studies, benefits to industry are anticipated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe understanding of the behavior of pavements is critical to the effectiveness and safety of roadway infrastructure, both in the United States and abroad.  One type of pavement, asphalt concrete, is composed of rock, asphalt cement (the black sticky stuff), and air.  Researchers know how much of each component is within asphalt concrete, but how the material is distributed is not consistent.  This random distribution is one reason asphalt concrete is called a heterogeneous material.  This research tested dozens of laboratory samples, all with the same amount of rock, asphalt cement, and air, but had different distributions of the components.  Tests run include creep compliance, which is an indication of the rutting susceptibility of asphalt concrete, and the Semi-Circular Bend fracture test, which is an indication of cracking.  The variation of material distribution caused different test results, which were then input into a computer simulation.  By using a computer simulation, a better understanding about the probability of the distribution of components was obtained.  Ideally, computer simulations save both time and money when evaluating the performance of new and innovative materials for asphalt concrete.  This is the first step in better using computers to simulate laboratory testing, and will lead to better predictions of actual field performance in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Braham"
