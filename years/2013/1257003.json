 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. forests face an unprecedented array of threats.  Scientists have typically studied these threats in isolation, but it is clear that changes in the distribution and abundance of tree species over the next century will depend on the cumulative impacts of a wide range of human impacts.  The proposed research will link an existing, well documented and tested model of forest dynamics to the continental-scale forest inventory data maintained by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program.  The new framework will expand the model to assess the effects of a broad suite of human impacts on eastern U.S. forests, including (1) climate change, (2) changes in logging regimes, (3) introduced pests and pathogens, and (4) increasing nitrogen (N) deposition and CO2 concentrations. Preliminary results suggest that the direct effects of climate change alone on the distribution and abundance of tree species in the eastern U.S .will be relatively small over the next 50-100 years, in part because direct climate impacts on adult tree survival are relatively small.  However, processes that increase the natural mortality rates of adult trees, such as harvesting or the spread of pests or pathogens, are expected to interact with the effects of climate change by opening the forest canopy and allowing the establishment of new species. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses a clear need of resource managers and policy makers for transparent, data-driven models that can be used to understand and predict forest response to a broad range of human impacts. For instance, the new model will be able to project the effects of proposed increases in forest harvest rates for production of energy biomass on subsequent forest productivity, and how the effects could change in combination with other human-caused impacts such as the accidental introduction of pests and pathogens.  The project will also provide training and workshops for students and management professionals in the use and application of this new tool for sustainable use of the nation's forests.",

The research was specifically designed to allow us to explore interactions between the broad suite of human impacts on eastern U.S. forests, including climate change, changes in logging regimes, and the litany of introduced pests and pathogens that are systematically decimating their host tree species in eastern U.S. forests.  Our analyses incorporate mechanisms acting at spatial scales ranging from individual tree neighborhoods to landscape and regional processes. Forest inventory data allowed us to examine how birth, growth, and death of the 50 most common tree species in eastern forests respond to variation in climate.  The inventory data also allowed us to characterize regional variation in logging regimes.  Those data reveal that logging is by far the most significant cause of adult tree mortality in the region, and the most important form of disturbance.  Partial harvesting has become the most prevalent form of logging, and generally favors more shade tolerant tree species.  At the same time, introduced pests and pathogens like the hemlock woolly adelgid and emerald ash borer are decimating populations of hemlocks and all of the eastern ash species.  But the most significant long-term impacts on forest structure and productivity come from agents like beech bark disease that only kill the largest of their host trees (American beech), and leave thickets of young, diseased stems that still outcompete many less shade tolerant tree species.  Climate change can be expected to eventually result in dramatic shifts in tree species distributions, but our results indicate that those changes will be slow to develop, and lag by up to 200 years behind changes in climate.  The lags occur because growth and survival of both adult trees and even smaller saplings are relatively insensitive to variation in climate.  And given that generation times and the lifespans of eastern trees are measured in centuries rather than decades, the current occupants of any forest are only likely to be displaced in 200-400 years, even under extreme scenarios of climate change. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles D Canham"
