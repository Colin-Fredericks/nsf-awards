 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis CAREER award supports a research project to reveal how nanocrystalline grain boundary networks evolve during plastic deformation and understand how this evolution affects subsequent mechanical response.  It is hypothesized that the unique deformation physics of nanocrystalline metals will allow for manipulation of the grain boundary network through thermomechanical treatments, connecting the heretofore separate fields of grain boundary engineering and nanostructured materials.  Specifically, the research is driven by three technical objectives:  (1) characterize the details of the grain boundary network in nanocrystalline materials, (2) measure the evolution of grain boundary character distribution and network topology under thermomechanical cycling, and (3) leverage the insight gained to develop new materials theory which connects grain boundary network details to mechanical behavior.  This work will combine advanced characterization techniques, carefully designed mechanical testing, and atomistic simulations to meet these objectives.  The insights obtained here will be used to connect interfacial network character to nanocrystalline mechanical behavior and to optimize the design of interfaces in nanostructured materials.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis program is motivated by several technologically relevant questions: (1) How are the properties of nanostructured materials influenced by the details of their grain boundary networks?  (2) How does mechanical deformation, both at room and elevated temperatures, alter these interfacial networks?  (3) Can the grain boundary network be optimized, through thermomechanical treatments, to engineer better nanomaterials?    This work will provide a roadmap for controlling the details of grain boundary structure and the interconnecting network formed by all boundaries in order to create improved nanostructured materials and enable next-generation technologies.  In addition, this project supports an outreach program to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.  A multi-tiered approach will be implemented to engage and empower high school students and teachers, as well as undergraduate university students, through direct laboratory experiences and exposure to interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nConcerning Intellectual Merit, this project discovered that thermomechanical cycling can evolve the population of interfaces contained within a nanocrystalline material, enabling the new field of nanocrystalline grain boundary engineering.  New deformation mechanisms that incorporated the boundaries themselves into the plastic flow led to unique evolution trends, with low-energy boundary types found throughout the microstructure.  The process occurred through a completely different path than grain boundary engineering in coarse-grained materials, meaning that new materials such as those with high stacking fault energies could be treated and improved.  Our characterization tasks developed transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) techniques that were in their infancy when the project started to measure nanocrystals as small as 5 nm.  Atomistic modeling was used to complement the experimental investigations, providing high temporal and spatial resolution to allow for complete description of the relevant mechanisms.  In addition, we developed and applied new analysis tools for atomistic simulations that allowed quantitative descriptions of microstructure to be extracted in ways that are directly comparable to experimental metrics.\n\n \n\nFor Broader Impacts, a comprehensive education and outreach program was developed that improve the participation of underrepresented minority students in high school and college.  High school students were reached through both individual research experiences where the PI acted as a direct mentor, but also through large scale educational workshops designed to increase interesting in materials science and nanoscale engineering.  Undergraduate students were assigned self-contained projects to give them research experience in order to prepare them for advanced study and applied engineering careers.  Finally, microstructure evolution and materials processing is extremely important for industry, meaning the findings of this study will enable large cost savings in the commercial sector. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Rupert"
