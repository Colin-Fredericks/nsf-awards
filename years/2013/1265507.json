 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert A. Pascal, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University will explore the synthesis of new types of configurationally stable, chiral, polycyclic aromatic molecules.  With the exception of the helicenes, such structures are quite uncommon and often difficult to synthesize, and their properties are largely unexplored.  Four new classes of these compounds are proposed, with syntheses that are very short and easily modified for the tuning of shapes and properties. Their structural features ensure both high barriers to racemization and generally high thermal stability, and most of the molecules should be strongly luminescent.  The resolved enantiomers of these compounds are expected to show very high optical rotations, strong circular dichroism, and strong circularly polarized luminescence, which in some cases may be modulated by external factors (temperature, light, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe expected photophysical and chiroptical properties of this class of molecules make them candidates for application as organic electronic materials, particularly in display technologies or as electrooptic modulators.  The expected structures may lend themselves to application as chiral catalysts or chiral hosts for separation technologies or medical diagnostics.  The research itself will provide training for a variety of undergraduate and graduate scientists including women and underrepresented minorities, who will later enter into productive careers in science, engineering, and medicine.",

In addition, large chiral molecules may find use as chiral catalysts for chemical synthesis or chiral hosts for the selective binding of biological molecules.\n\nOur synthetic work in this area resulted in the preparation of numerous chiral aromatic compounds: more than a dozen propeller shaped in-cyclophanes and in,in-cyclophanes (e.g., Image 3, compounds 1 and 2), a unique chiral bis-anthraquinone cyclophane (3), a series of benzannulated decacyclenes (e.g., 4) that are propeller-shaped polycyclic aromatics, a series of highly luminescent helicenes, that are helical polycyclic aromatics (e.g. 5), and a series of \"hairpin furans\" (e.g. 6) that combine the structures of helicenes and twisted polycyclic aromatics.  Compounds 1, 3, and 5, and and several similar molecules were resolved into pure enantiomers, and they were found to display high specific rotations ranging from 800 to 1500 as well as very strong circular dichroism.  The resolution of compounds such as 4 and 6 was unsuccessful.  However, none of these indisputably beautiful molecules achieve the level of chiroptical properties necessary for successful materials applications.  \n\nOf all the molecules prepared, 2 and 6 proved to be the most interesting.  The neutron diffraction structure of compound 2 (Image 2) showed it to have the shortest non-bonded contact distance between two hydrogen atoms ever observed (that is, the distance \"c\" in Image 3 or the distance between H(1) and H(2) in Image 2).  Not only is the contact distance a \"world record\", but the NMR and IR spectroscopic properties of this molecule substantially differ from those calculated by using the most popular chemical computational methods, and thus argue for a re-examination of these methods.  The X-ray structure of compound 6 (Image 1), shows it to contain a large, chiral cleft between the terminal phenanthrene groups.  Future derivatives this molecule may prove useful as hosts for selective binding of chiral molecules or as ligands for chiral catalysts.\n\nThis project provided the training for four graduate students in chemistry, two of whom have graduated and are currently pursuing careers in academia and industry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert A Pascal"
