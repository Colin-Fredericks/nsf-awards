 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a low-cost 10kW micro-turbine power generator that provides the basis for portability, fuel flexibility, and reduced maintenance of conventional turbo-machines at a cost that is competitive with reciprocating engines.  Current micro-turbines have prohibitively high costs due to complicated geometry and materials, but the proposed research will develop a micro-turbine with significantly lower manufacturing costs using a novel layered stackable architecture for the core micro-turbine engine.  The primary research objectives are 1) to optimize micro-turbine components within the framework of the new proposed geometry using a combination of in-house numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics, 2) to design application-specific peripherals and user interface for power generation at oil and gas wells - the proposed entry market, and 3) to build and test a field-ready prototype to validate the engine design and benchmark engine performance.  The result of the proposed project is a compact, and low-maintenance 10kW micro-turbine power generator that will be produced for lower than $500 per kW.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is greatly increased commercial viability of micro-turbine power generators.  The primary advantages of micro-turbines are portability, fuel flexibility, and low maintenance.  Micro-turbines do not have significant market share due to prohibitively high upfront costs, but the proposed technology will bring costs down and enable micro-turbines to gain significant traction in many markets, including emergency response, oil and gas well power generation, and other remote/distributed power generation applications. Due to their portability, micro-turbine generators can be deployed quickly in emergency situations.  Due to their fuel flexibility, implementing micro-turbines can significantly reduce the costs associated with the fuel supply chain, for example, associated gases that would otherwise be flared at oil/gas wells can be used to power equipment onsite.  Due to their low maintenance, microturbines can be adopted where operating costs can be prohibitive for reciprocating engines.  Lastly, the proposed project will lead to reduced carbon footprint by efficiently using fuel that would be otherwise wasted (as in the case of flare gas), reduce other toxic emissions via more efficient combustion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project was to develop a gas turbine electric generator that will provide superior performance, reliability, and robustness in industrial and remote power applications, especially in the oil and gas industry.  Existing generator products in the industry are reciprocating engines powered by either natural gas or diesel, and gas turbine engines powered primarily by natural gas.  Reciprocating engines have very little fuel flexibility; gas turbine engines are somewhat fuel flexible but still not robust enough for many applications in the O&amp;G industry, and they are also slow to respond to load changes.  The critical features of this new gas turbine generator were 1) fuel flexibility to reliably generate power using onsite fuel such as flare gas, and 2) instantaneous load response and power management to handle severe load requirements in the oil field.  This project was successful in meeting the original objectives.\n\nFirst, a fuel flexible gas turbine engine including a robust combustor was designed, implemented, and tested.  The combustor design includes novel geometry to develop a primary zone vortex that helps to sustain combustion stability across a large range of gaseous fuel types with energy densities between 900 BTU/scf and 2400 BTU/scf and with various mixtures of non-combustible gases such as N2 and CO2.  The gas turbine engine itself was built using off the shelf turbomachinery hardware, which minimizes capital requirements when scaling up production.  In-house expertise and software were developed to quickly match characteristics of turbomachinery components and estimate gas turbine performance.  Even though the technologies were developed for a 10 kW engine, they are readily scalable to larger engines up to least 100 kW.\n\nSecond, a novel power management system was developed that allows the generator to instantaneously respond to large load changes.  A power electronics architecture that incorporates energy storage was designed for this gas turbine generator.  A matching control system was developed to control the engine operating point and the power delivery to the customer in a novel way.  As a result, the generator can meet instantaneous load changes as well as large inrush currents much higher than the full load rating of the generator.  This is not true for traditional reciprocating engines driving conventional generators, which stall easily when turning on large motors.  The project developed significant intellectual property around the power management system, including control software, control tuning parameters, a significant amount of test data, and a patentable power electronics architecture.\n\nLastly, the project also developed a second product, an industrial air heating unit for use in construction and O&amp;G industries to provide heated air.  The product also takes advantage of the fuel flexible gas turbine engine to use unprocessed fuels, such as flare gas, to generate useful heat.  Both the heater product and generator product have successfully passed the pilot trial stage with multiple customers for each product.\n\nIn terms of broader impact, widespread adoption of these products will significantly reduce cost of energy for the industry.  The fuel flexibility allows customers to use cheaper fuels, or even free fuels in the case of flare gas, to produce useful heat and power.  The superior reliability of these products will also reduce maintenance requirements, which can be very costly for remote locations.  Also important is the potential for significant positive environmental impact from all of the above advantages: higher reliability reduces cost and energy use associated with otherwise frequent maintenance activities, and using onsite fuel like flare gas instead of using diesel (which has high transportation cost due to frequent refilling) will also create meaningful reductions to emissions.  Lastly, broader adoption of better power management technology will increase power efficiency in many applications in the industry.  One example is to replace a conventional generator, oversized for inrush current and running mostly at partial load, with a right-sized generator that includes power management to handle inrush and periodic load changes, such that the right-sized generator can always operate at peak efficiency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ivan Wang"
