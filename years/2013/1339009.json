 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests Phase II funding for the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) to remain an active site in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is university-based enterprise providing innovative solutions for logistics and distribution excellence with our member organizations. CELDi was founded in 2002, with MU joining as a research site in 2008 \r\n\r\nAs logistics and distribution become a dominant sector of the U.S. economy, the MU research site is uniquely positioned to contribute to CELDi's ability to serve as a think tank and as a driver of the research agenda in the field. In doing so, MU's researchers are developing new approaches to key business problems in the logistics and distribution area and applying them to real-world problems that are experienced by the member organizations on a frequent basis. MU has a highly successful track record in research areas which comprise the range of topics addressed by CELDi: Logistics, Supply Chain, and Distribution / Production Systems. In addressing research issues in these areas, members of CELDi and the broader academic community will reap the benefits of intellectual contribution of MU researchers. \r\n\r\nMU has achieved broad impact across the spectrum of organizations that have participated. MU is committed to a diverse faculty representation and to the inclusion of a diverse student population, and will more aggressively pursue these diversity efforts over the next five years. MU works with various companies and government agencies so these organizations are able to operate profitably and keep people employed in their region. MU has also had an impact on the lives of working people through its research which results in better and healthier ways for people to work productively. As the MU research site expands over the next five years, it will continue to see broad and meaningful impacts of its research in a wide range of organizations.",
