 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research to examine the sociocultural factors that shape diet and physical activity practices as they influence nutritional status outcomes among Alaska Native elders (adults aged 65+ years) living in Anchorage. This project will (1) identify and evaluate the influence of sociocultural factors on dietary and physical activity patterns among urban Alaska Native elders, and (2) identify relationships between the sociocultural environment, diet, physical activity, and nutritional status outcomes (BMI) in this population. This 9-month long mixed-methods research study employs participant observation, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and anthropometric techniques. Ten to fifteen interviews will be conducted with Alaska Native elders in Anchorage to identify the sociocultural factors that influence diet and physical activity practices. From these data, the investigator will finalize the questionnaires which measures typical foods eaten (food frequency), engagement in physical activities, and the strength of sociocultural influences on these dietary and activity practices (a cultural survey). This questionnaire will be orally administered by the researcher as a structured interview and anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) will be taken with a representative sample of 75 Alaska Native elders in Anchorage. Anthropometric measurements will be used to determine BMI and the prevalence of under weight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity and will be tested with multiple regression techniques to determine the nature of the relationship between sociocultural factors and nutritional status outcomes in this population. The research project has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural context of aging and health among urban Alaskan Native elders.",

In the U.S., the proportion of people aged 60+ years is growing faster than any other age group. Alaska has the largest proportion of its population in this senior age group, creating a unique public health challenge because older adults are particularly at risk for overweight and obesity. With a mixed methods approach, I collected observational data, interviews (N=15), as well as body measurements (height, weight, waist circumference), self-reported food questionnaires, and exercise surveys with a sample of 82 older adults in Anchorage, Alaska. I recruited volunteer participants aged 65 and over from a local senior center, two senior living communities, and various locations throughout Anchorage. This project generates a set of data that identifies the most important social and cultural influences on how this sample of older adults in Anchorage make their dietary and physical activity decisions, documents what they eat and how often they tend to exercise, and measures the nutritional status outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results from this study reveal that overweight and obesity rates are high in Anchorage, as 82% of this convenience sample were overweight (37%) or obese (45%). Ten percent of participants can be considered healthy based on their waist-to-height ratios. The majority of participants were aged between 65 and 74 years old (60%), Euro-American (61%), female (63%), and low-income (54%). The most commonly consumed food items were grains, followed by vegetables, then fats/sugars. However, the grains consumed were largely &ldquo;white&rdquo; (refined and processed) rather than whole grains. The majority of study participants considered eating cultural, traditional, or native food either very important (30%) or somewhat important (28%). A majority (65%) of participants had health or safety concerns of store-bought foods. The healthy eating index score (HEI) demonstrates whether the sample meets federal dietary guidelines, where a higher score indicates intakes closer to the recommended ranges and amounts of different food groups (max score = 100). This sample population of older adults in Anchorage had an HEI of 57, indicating relatively low consumption of fruits and vegetables, but high in sugars and fats. Nationwide data suggest older adults in the U.S. usually have an HEI between 62-66, so this sample is below national averages.</p>\n<p>No participants reported vigorous or intense physical activity, so analysis was limited to &ldquo;moderate-intensity&rdquo; and &ldquo;all activity.&rdquo; The mean weekly caloric expenditure in all exercise-related activities was 3,955 and in moderate intensity exercise-related activities 1,809 calories. The average participant engaged in approximately 19 physical activities per week such as housework or yoga, 6 of these 19 activities of which were &ldquo;moderate intensity&rdquo; such as brisk walking. People who reported the media and their friends as stronger influences on their behaviors tended to have higher engagement in physical activities. In other words, media exposure and social support networks had a positive effect on helping older adults get more exercise. In interviews, several participants mentioned the positive impact of healthy living or healthy cooking television programs on improving their dietary and activity patterns. Adults who were younger (aged 65-74) reported stronger friend networks than older adults.
