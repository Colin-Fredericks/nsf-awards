 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is one key segment of a larger effort centered on the Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field project, to be conducted December 2013-January 2014.  OWLeS will focus on two complementary lines of research, each tracing to a preferred wind regime over the U.S. Great lakes region and corresponding distinct mesoscale mode of winter storm organization.  Activities led by this group will focus on so-called \"long-fetch\" storm events, for which low-level winds are aligned approximately parallel to Lake Ontario's long axis.  Observational assets to be employed during OWLeS include the University of Wyoming King Air instrumented aircraft, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radars, multiple mobile rawinsounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other deployable surface measurement systems.  These researchers contend that predictions of the amounts and inland extent of LeS snowfall remain poor, due in part to fine-scale variations in upwind planetary boundary layer structure and poor representation of cloud microphysical, dynamical, and surface processes.  To address these shortcomings, the intellectual merits of this research will derive from improved understanding of:  1) How long-fetch LeS intensify and evolve downwind of the lake, where prolonged heavy snowfall rates are particularly impactful; 2) how cloud and dynamical processes may contribute to cloud electrification and to lightning, as occasionally observed in long-fetch LeS heavy precipitation cells; and 3) how dual-polarimetric (and in select regions, dual-Doppler) radar measurements at X- and S-band wavelengths as utilized by mobile-DOW and operational National Weather Service WSR-88D radars, respectively, may reveal detailed precipitation processes in LeS.  Through detailed comparisons with in-situ aircraft measurements, evaluations dual-polarimetric particle identification and quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) algorithms will extend the utility of remote-sensing observations in this unique cool-season environment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include experience infield campaign planning, hands-on data collection and data analysis for a notably large number of undergraduate as well as graduate students.  A desirable mix of junior and senior principal investigators will facilitate exchange of established and complex project design and observing methodologies, and foster improved field observing techniques tailored to severe winter weather conditions.  Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 students and college students enrolled at nearby institutes of higher learning.  Given the significant impacts of lake effect snowfall on public safety and economic activity along the populous shores of the U.S. Great Lakes, improved understanding of lake-effect systems should foster refined models and forecasting techniques that will address a longer-term societal need.",

data from several lake-effect storms (see included image from the edge of one of these impressive storms on December 18, 2013). &nbsp;It was a highly successful project as we were expecting eight storm events of opportunity based on climatology and actually observed 24! &nbsp;The focus of this grant was on a type of lake-effect snowstorm that forms along the west-to-east (long) axis of Lake Ontario as a narrow, intense band of snow (rates 1-5 inches hr-1). &nbsp;We had very successful public outreach during the project (e.g., see the image from our well-attended open house in Penn Yan, NY on December 4, 2013). &nbsp;One of the most unique aspects of the project was that <em>undergraduate</em> students conducted most of the fieldwork; 24 SUNY Oswego students were part of this aspect of the grant. &nbsp;Two students from the Federal University of Alagoas in Brazil were invited to participate and observed snow for the first time of their lives! &nbsp;Several of these students were able to live out their dream of flying into a lake-effect snow band collecting data (see image of a lake-effect cloud as taken from inside one of the OWLeS key facilities, the Wyoming King Air plane). &nbsp;These experiences inspired several undergraduates to further their education by doing well in graduate school.</p>\n<p><br />The grant&rsquo;s principal investigators hired teams of students, once again many undergraduates, to analyze the collected data during the years following the field campaign. &nbsp;SUNY Oswego scientists, supported by this grant through 2018, analyzed mostly radar and lightning data to determine why lake-effect storms become electrified. &nbsp;A surprise finding was that all lightning during this project occurred inland and not over the lake as previous research suggested (over the lake is where the most turbulent motions occur as cold air moves over relatively &ldquo;hot&rdquo; water, a key ingredient thought to initiate lightning). &nbsp;A hypothesis to explain this observation is that a recently constructed wind turbine farm over the Tug Hill Plateau due east of Lake Ontario was involved in initiating many of the lake-effect lightning strikes during the OWLeS field campaign. &nbsp;Another major aspect of lake-effect storms that the Oswego team focused on was the development of boundaries (like mini-cold fronts) and small-scale vortices (1-4 km wide) within the lake-effect snow band (see image of radar reflectivity and wind arrows). &nbsp;It was found these features can affect snowfall intensity and storm location and their development was related to how close the band was to a particular shoreline. &nbsp;One of our objectives, which we have not studied in depth yet, is to use dual-polarimetric Doppler-on-Wheels (DOW) radar (i.e., a radar which transmits waves in vertical and horizontal polarizations) to remotely determine particle types within the storm and to better quantify how much snow falls on the ground using this radar. &nbsp;We hope to do these investigations in the near future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/26/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
