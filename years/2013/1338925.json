The proposed center will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies (CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications. \r\n\r\nThe mission of the new Center would be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to use their established relationship with leading organizations to broadcast the research results and recruit new members through the organization channels. The PIs plan to develop new curriculum within existing degree programs at the three sites, and to continue their diversity traditions to include minorities and other underrepresented groups in center activities.",

A systematic and integrative understanding of the four dimensions can empower us to address many scientific and engineering challenges. The Spatiotemporal I/UCRC (a.k.a NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center) was established in 2013 as a collaboration among George Mason University (led by Chaowei Yang), University of California at Santa Barbara (led by Keith Clarke), and Harvard University (led by Peter Bol, Jason Ur, and Wendy Guan) to build such an enabling national and international spatiotemporal infrastructure. The phase I (2013-2019) investigation has been focusing on understanding the importance of spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications in different domains and as a core to computer science and software engineering. This is achieved through the joint efforts of the three sites and our 15+ members as well as many other collaborative organizations. The success of Phase I demonstrated the possibility of building the spatiotemporal infrastructure with 10+ faculty placed at top departments in the US, 4 startups created, 200+ papers published, and 5000+ audiences directly engaged. The outcome also enabled many high-profiled applications from planetary defense (saving our home planet from potential asteroid threat) to secondary cities (building data infrastructure in hotspot cities) using the latest spatiotemporal tools and technologies.
