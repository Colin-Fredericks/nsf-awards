 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide new information about how hormones specifically control hunger. Decisions about how much to eat are affected by the amount of food previously eaten and the need to engage in other activities. Thus, motivation  to eat will be carefully measured in either food-limited or food-unlimited laboratory rodents that will be provided with behavioral options, including the ability to interact with other members of their species. Experiments are designed to determine whether gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone (GnIH) increases the appetite for food, inhibits the reproductive system, or both, and to specify how GnIH orchestrates behavioral priorities. The activation of individual brain cells that secrete GnIH will be measured using immunohistochemistry and a map will be created of the GnIH-cell activation that occurs at the time hunger levels increase and decrease. Drugs that block GnIH binding to its receptors will be used to determine whether GnIH is necessary for food-restriction-induced changes in hunger and the reproductive system. Other experiments will examine whether hormones secreted by the ovary control neural activity in GnIH cells. This project will offer important insights into the high incidence of obesity and eating disorders in women and explore links to the side effects of contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. This research will have broad impact on the public's understanding of appetite and its interaction with reproduction, fertility, exercise, health, lifestyle, drugs, and prescription hormones. The funding will be used to establish a collaboration with the Kriegsfled laboratory, to team-train graduate and undergraduate students, and to engage in K-12 outreach activities. The award will provide support for the PI's participation, as an NSF ADVANCE chair, in STEM women's seminars and a \"writing boot camp\". In addition to using traditional publication venues, both PI's will disseminate their work via their webpages and behavioral endocrinology blogs.",

We had reason to believe that the level of food intake and body fat together determine the levels of chemicals in the brain known as neuropeptides. We also suspected that specific neuropeptides would behave differently depending on the levels of hormones, chemical messengers that travel long distances to act on other tissues. We studied two neuropeptides, RFamide-related-peptide-3 (RFRP-3) and kisspeptin. We studied these neuropeptides on a background of high or low levels of the ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone. We first found that restricted caloric intake activated brain cells that secreted RFRP-3 in one particular part of the brain, which in turn changed the motivation to engage in certain behaviors. In food-restricted and well-fed females, we compared the activation of these neurpeptide cells to the behavioral choice between ingestive and reproductive behavior. This is an important decision for female mammals (including women) because pregnancy and lactation are two processed that demand a lot of energy, and this energy comes from food. Thus, females must avoid reproduction during times of low food availability, and when food is available, they must overeat and store body fat in anticipation of the high energetic costs of pregnancy and lactation. When the appearance of mating partners coincides with times of high fertility and adequate stored energy, foraging behavior falls in priority, and behaviors related to courtship and mating rise in priority. We found that in females, RFRP-3 cells in a part of the brain known as the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) were significantly activated by the same levels of food restriction that also increased the motivation to hoard food and simultaneously decreased the motivation to engage with males. In response to the same level of food restriction, there was little or no change in levels of ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone. There were, however, big changes in behavioral sensitivity to those same hormones. Whereas RFRP-3 cells were quite responsive to incremental increases in the duration of food restriction, no such changes were seen in kisspeptin cells. Thus, we focused our attention on RFRP-3 and not kisspeptin. We tested the idea that increasing levels of RFRP-3 in the brain was sufficient but not necessary to decrease sexual motivation. Our data support this hypothesis because infusion of RFRP-3 into the hypothalamic area inhibited reproductive motivation and increased ingestive motivation. Genetic knockdown of RFRP-3 cells failed to block the effects of restriction on behavior. Next, we tested the idea that the activation of RFRP-3 cells was decreased by estradiol and/or progesterone. The activation of RFRP-3 cells was decreased by estradiol plus progesterone, progesterone alone, but not by estradiol alone. Given the role of progesterone, we were surprised in the next experiment to discover that the DMH does not have progesterone receptors. This gives clues to a circuit that involves progesterone receptors outside the DMH projecting to RFRP-3 cells inside the DMH. Yet another experiment found that NPY cells (which are known to have progesterone receptors) have axonal projections that reach to areas in very close proximity to the cell bodies of RFRP-3 cells in the DMH. This shows how progesterone might act on cells with progesterone receptors that communicate with intermediary cells that secrete RFRP-3. Finally, we found evidence that males are relatively insensitive to the same levels of food restriction or deprivation that inhibits reproduction in females. This occured despite the fact that food-restricted males are at least as hungry or maybe even more hungry than food-restricted females. This sex difference might provide another window into the underlying hormone-peptide interactions in the future. In summary, very mild food restriction alters the activation of RFRP-3 cells to decrease sexual motivation and increase the hunger for food, and these effects are modulated by progesterone. These discoveries have implications for understanding how different metabolic states (obesity, diabetes, eating disorders) alter moods and behaviors by changing the nervous system. Furthermore, these metabolic effects differ with the level of sex hormones (levels that fluctuate over the ovulatory cycle and differ between males and females). This NSF grant provided support for training undergraduate and graduate students and ushering them into careers in science and medicine.
