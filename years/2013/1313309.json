 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the cosmic history of star formation is one of the fundamental goals in contemporary astronomy. Much of the light produced by star formation over cosmic time is obscured by dust and reradiated at far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths. For redshifts > 1, this light may be detected as submillimeter (submm) galaxies. Unfortunately, current studies of dust-obscured, star-forming galaxies at these distances are limited by confusion and blending, which prevents us from studying the dominant populations that produce the FIR extragalactic background light. In order to address this concern, the PIs will use the new SCUBA-2 submm camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at 450 microns (and simultaneously at 850 microns) to obtain high-resolution observations of submm galaxies. \r\n\r\nThis work will signi&#64257;cantly expand our understanding of the submm universe and the history of dusty star formation. The research team will also work with graduate students to develop a science activity for high school students that will teach them about dust in galaxies. Finally, the PIs will train graduate students in submm and radio astronomy, the facilities for which the U.S. has made significant investments.",
