 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inland bodies of freshwater are a resource that is critical for the Nation's health and safety.  This project is developing a new spatio-temporal field representation suitable for modeling, planning and control under uncertainty in order to improve monitoring of such water systems. The project's focus is on a reconfigurable aquatic sensor-actuator network designed to capture data from coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur across space and time-scales.  The key advantages of this sensor-actuator network in its application to this domain include synoptic volume coverage, adaptive sampling, flexible control and robustness to component failure.  The research objective is to build models of dynamic processes for which high resolution sampling is necessary at special locations. Toward this end, this project is contributing new methods, data-structures, algorithms, and implementations validated by field testing a heterogeneous system consisting of stationary and mobile (robotic) underwater node. \r\n\r\nThis project provides unique interdisciplinary opportunities for education of both graduate and undergraduate students via new course work that blends projects and research topics directly into courses and newly developed seminars. It provides a multi-disciplinary experience for students while developing their engineering skills. Relevant components of computer science, computer engineering, and mechanical engineering are integrated together by using the project's aquatic platform and experimental scenarios as a focal point. \r\n\r\nThe project advances the state-of-the-art for such systems because it integrates low-level dynamic processes with high-level planning and distributed optimization. The research represents a change in the scale of robotic aquatic sampling away from immense bodies of\r\nwater in oceanographic research, toward bodies of water that have a more immediate affect on our well-being as they are sources and stores of drinking water. The impact of datasets which lead to better understanding of managed and natural inlets, differing topography including dam walls and man-made structures, regions of turbulence, and seasonal algal growth are immense.",

For a given measurement of interest, i.e. dissolved oxygen or nitrates, localizing regions that contain either (1) high variability or (2) extreme values can help authorities identify potential abnormalities and address the problem. This improved environmental modeling has value for scientists, industry, and the government. Traditional techniques for gathering this type of data typically rely on stationary buoys or human-operated vessels. More recently, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are being used in these scenarios; however, their data collection routines are typical constrained to either idling in a single location or following a predefined sampling trajectory, i.e. a lawnmower pattern. These strategies are highly inefficient when the overall goal is to locate and characterize small areas of highly concentrated data. Aquatic environments exacerbate this problem ? operator changes to an AUV mission trajectory are difficult due to communication limitations. Rather, autonomous systems now have the capability to adapt their trajectories based on in-situ data to focus sampling efforts on higher-level goals. Giving an AUV these higher-level goals such as locating, tracking, or mapping environmental phenomena lets the system execute this objective with greater efficiency due to the ability to adapt in response to measurements collected during the mission. In this way, much more information can be gathered about the measurement of interest than is currently available through static buoys or pre-planned trajectories.This research provides optimal adaptive sampling strategies for AUVs to be deployed in an environment where limited operator interaction is available. In particular, this effort combines the areas of surrogate modeling, adaptive sampling, and optimal trajectory generation. Autonomous systems can leverage real-time surrogate models of the surrounding environment by using the models to inform the selection of new sampling points. A delicate tradeoff then must be balanced between densely sampling a region of interest, while also continuing to consider unexplored areas.&nbsp;The proposed strategy of solving this problem is to combine Gaussian processes with optimal path planning. Gaussian processes have become the status-quo for surrogate modeling of environmental phenomena due to their ability to characterize both spatial correlations and measurement uncertainty within the model. Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian, non-parametric modeling technique where model uncertainty can be exploited to guide sampling to high-information areas. Trajectory optimization can then utilize these models by choosing the sampling paths that have the highest reward with respect to the desired mission. Steps to the proposed sampling algorithm include the following: (1) Perform Gaussian process regression to model the environment based on collected measurements. (2) Use the Gaussian process upper confidence bound algorithm to choose subsequent sampling locations in a multi-armed bandit setting. (3) Perform receding horizon cross-entropy trajectory optimization for path planning between sampling locations.This research focuses on developing and proving the algorithmic framework to perform these types of missions. The advantages of the proposed sampling routine are shown in simulation data. In particular, when compared to a standard lawnmower pattern, the adaptive process is able to acquire more data and better model multiple regions of interest for a simulated dissolved oxygen distribution. Further, field testing experiments in the Chesapeake Bay on an Iver3 AUV show the capability of these algorithms to be successfully deployed in the water.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/11/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marin&nbsp;Kobilarov</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249493933_as_static--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249493933_as_static--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comparison of lawnmower and adaptive sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249493933_as_static--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison of lawnmower and adaptive sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of lawnmower and adaptive sampling</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JHU ASCO</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marin&nbsp;Kobilarov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Comparison of lawnmower and adaptive sampling</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249896685_roundbay_path2d--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249896685_roundbay_path2d--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Adaptive Sampling Path taken by Iver underwater vehicle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547249896685_roundbay_path2d--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Adaptive Sampling Path taken by Iver underwater vehicle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adaptive Sampling Path taken by Iver underwater vehicle</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JHU ASCO</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marin&nbsp;Kobilarov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Adaptive Sampling Path taken by Iver underwater vehicle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547250327259_iver2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547250327259_iver2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Iver AUV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1302360/1302360_10250992_1547250327259_iver2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Iver AUV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Iver AUV</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JHU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marin&nbsp;Kobilarov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Iver AUV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
