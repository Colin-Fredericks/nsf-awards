 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will test a novel hypothesis that eukaryotic cells use wave fringe counting to measure their lengths and shapes. The project was inspired by an experiment showing that strong alternating electric fields disrupt mitosis in a way that is resonant at radio frequencies. The PI will bring ideas from physics, where it is well understood that fringe counting is the method for measuring lengths stable at large scales. The PI hypothesis that fringe counting work cells uses simulated inertia: a method commonly by human engineers in designing microchips and also playing role in biology in the functioning of the cochlea. The larger objective of the proposed research is to identify the meter sticks of life. The intellectual merit of the proposed research might lead to a fundamentally new understanding of cell regulatory machinery. A potential discovery that cells can and do measure lengths by means of fringe counting would open a new chapter in our understanding of morphogenesis and biology in general and can lead to transformation of medicine.",

This remains an unsolved \nproblem over a century after D'Arcy Thompson first published his \ntreatise on biological growth and form.  The central idea behind the \nwork was that the length mensuration system of life must involve TIME.  \nThe argument that this is so involves elementary physics considerations \nof chemical reactions plus the observation that the length mensuration \nmachinery of life, whatever it is, is extremely plastic and works over a \nwide range of scales. The empirical case for the existence of such \nmeasuration machinery has remained weak (nonexistent) for so long simply \nbecause (2) the powerful tools of biochemistry are all slow and (2) the \nsignals are small.\n\nThe research produced a single work: R. B. Laughlin, \"Critical Waves and \nthe Length Problem of Biology,\" Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 112, 10371 \n(2015).  This paper explained the above ideas and then proceeded to \ndemonstrate the engineering principles by which reaction-diffusion waves \ncould be stabilized.  It had been known since the work of Turing that \nchemical reactions can easily manufacture such waves, which are \npropagating disturbances, like a chain of falling dominoes, that are \npowered by engines, as opposed waves of sound or light, which involve \nonly inertia and passive forces.  But reaction-diffusion systems are \nnotoriously unstable. The literature on them mostly concerns the \nfantastic patterns they produce. Biology can easily eliminate this this \nproblem by just throwing out all the reaction-diffusion systems that \"do \nnot work\". This paper showed what the engineering principle was by which \nthey could do so and cause the \"well engineered\" waves to act exactly \nlike waves of sound or light. The trick is simply to turn the engine \n\"gain\" up until the system almost oscillates.  This particular \nengineering principle is known to be operating in the cochlea. It is the \nreason that a microphone placed near an ear detects sound emanating from \nit. Once one has constructed a propagating disturbance with a fixed \nspeed scale, one can measure out lengths by echo timing or by standing \nwave frequency resonance detection, like a laser.  The latter is the \nprinciple that enables electron waves to measure out the sizes of atoms.  \nThe different in this case is that the waves are manufactors by the \nliving system itself, rather than existing in the natural world in the \nabsence of life.\n\nThe work then went further to make a prediction that chemical potential \nwaves of this nature should be present in eucaryotic cells undergoing \nmitosis.  The argument rested partly on observations made by others \n(including Thompson) that mitotic spindle patterns look like dipole \noscillations of sound in a round enclosure. Cell division involves length \nmensuration, and it is very ancient and highly conserved, so this is a \ngood place to look for engineering principles that work. But the \nargument also used the fact that chemical oscillations of exactly this \nform had been observed in E Coli 15 years before, and were known to be \ncentral to locating the midpoint for cell devision.\n\nSubsequent to the publication of this work, chemical potential waves of \nthe predicted nature were experimentally discovered in a eukaryotic cell \nundergoing mitosis: S. Xiao et al., \"Mitotic Cortial Waves Predict \nFuture Division Sites by Encoding Positional and Size Information,\" \nDevelopmental Cell 43, 493 (2017).
