 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Haley of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon will prepare and study molecules based on or inspired by the indenofluorene skeleton to answer fundamental scientific questions as well as to explore their materials properties. The Haley research program will develop facile synthetic methods for the assembly of these strongly electron-accepting molecules. Once in hand, the Haley group will examine the optical and electronic properties of all new molecular scaffolds with an emphasis towards organic field effect transistor (OFET) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications and use in devices. The study of such molecules answers fundamental questions regarding the electronic structure and properties of non-benzenoid organic materials.\r\n\r\nThe molecules developed in these studies present opportunities for practical applications, particularly in the area of nanotechnology and low-cost electronics.  Moreover, this project serves as an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers in fundamental and applied chemical synthesis. The studies will provide the researchers with broad experience in organic synthesis, computational chemistry, x-ray crystallography, and the interplay between electronic structure and molecular architecture. The broader impacts of this program include industrial internships of graduate students at local and regional companies and national labs, the exchange of graduate students with those of foreign collaborators in Germany, Denmark, and Japan, the hosting of extended stays of visiting scientists including professors from PUIs, and continued substantial involvement of undergraduates in state-of-the-art chemical research via programs which promote the participation of underrepresented groups.",
