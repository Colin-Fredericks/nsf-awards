With this grant, we supported the travel of seven graduate students from seven different universities.  Each award recipient received up to $1200 in reimbursement funds to help defray the cost of registration and airfare to the conference.  These awards enriched the professional development of the students by providing them with an opportunity to attend an IEEE-affiliated conference in their field of study, networking and computer communications.  Each of the supported students presented a full paper or workshop paper at the conference.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher W Miller"
