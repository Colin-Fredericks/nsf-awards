 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to improve empirical models of the mapping of ionospheric field-aligned currents (FAC) as a function of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by using data which are both more accurate and of large volume than those used in previous models. This mapping will cover an entire solar cycle. The magnetic field data to be used in the FAC calculation will come from th Oersted, CHAMP and eventually Swarm missions. Solar wind data will come from the ACE satellite. The team will use the FAC to develop mappings of the Poynting flux.  This in turn will aid prediction of density and temperature in the upper atmosphere. Intervals with polar cap potential saturation during large magnetic storms will be examined to see if the current density and total current will saturate. \r\nA graduate student will be supported by this grant. The PI has an excellent record of disseminating his models to the larger science community.",
