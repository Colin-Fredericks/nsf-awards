 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Schools of Education and of Science and Mathematics, and The STEM Center of Excellence at The Citadel, in collaboration with the following high-need school districts - Berkeley County, Charleston County, Colleton County, Dorchester 4 and Hampton 1- are establishing the RECON (Recruit, Educate, Certify and Obtain New-Teachers) program to provide high-quality mathematics and science teachers for high-need school districts in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. This Phase I program is preparing 30 new teachers of mathematics and science teachers for high needs schools. Each of these teachers graduate with a major in mathematics, engineering or one of physical or natural sciences.  Ten of these teachers come from the ranks of juniors majoring in chemistry or biology.  Twenty come from STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) career changers who progress through an Accelerated MAT (Master of Arts in Teaching) program in Biology or in Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Noyce scholarship recipients are benefitting from: scholarships to cover tuition cost and facilitate attendance by a diverse group of individuals; coursework aligned with the Common Core that provides the pedagogical skills and content knowledge necessary to effectively educate students in mathematics and science; individualized plans of study with ongoing advising and assistance; university/school system collaboration to ensure placement in appropriate teaching positions in high-need schools;  support programs including individualized mentoring by school-system educators and university personnel; and professional development programs through the university's STEM Center of Excellence.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This project is growing STEM-related capacity in South Carolina's Lowcountry as well as the state and nation. The scholarships are enabling potential educators from low socio-economic backgrounds and other diverse backgrounds to go to college to pursue their aspiration of making a difference through education. In addition, having partnerships across five school districts linked to The Citadel provides educators with the support they need to more effectively teach the STEM disciplines. The pedagogical content focus of the proposal enhances the teacher knowledge and ability of participants to assist  K-12 students with diverse learning needs and backgrounds in pursuing Career Pathways (part of South Carolina's Education Economic Development Act) options. The project staff and evaluators are studying the marketing, recruitment, pedagogy and partnerships with K-12 schools and develop conference, presentations, publications, and other products to disseminate results of these studies within the scientific, educational and evaluation communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA critical shortage of teachers in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields exists in South Carolina.  In an effort to address this shortage, The Citadel applied for and was awarded a five-year RECON (Recruit, Educate, Certify, and Obtain New Teachers) grant from the National Science Foundation in 2013.  Through this grant, both undergraduate and graduate students seeking a career in teaching science or math could apply for financial support in the form of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship.  The scholarship provided two years of support, and students were required to teach in a high-needs school district within South Carolina upon completion of their education.  Over the course of the five-year grant period, twenty-two students completed their training to become certified teachers.  Five of these students were undergraduates, one training to become a Chemistry teacher, and four training to become Biology teachers.  Seventeen graduate students in the Master of Arts of Teaching degree program also received support from the Noyce scholarship.   Ten of these graduate students trained to become Biology teachers, and seven trained to become Math teachers.  Overall, this scholarship provided crucial financial support for one new Chemistry teacher, seven new Math teachers, and fourteen new Biology teachers in high-needs school districts within South Carolina.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristy Y Johnson"
