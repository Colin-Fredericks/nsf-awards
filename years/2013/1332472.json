The latter (which we will refer to as particle dispersion) is associated with the tendency of heavy particles to be thrown out of turbulent eddies, forming high-concentration particle sheets in the interstitial region between the turbulent eddies. This small-scale heterogeneity is known to cause fluctuations in the particle concentration of several orders of magnitude, which in turn have a dramatic effect on processes that involve particle collision and agglomeration. While stochastic Lagrangian models (SLMs) have been shown to accurately simulate large-scale particle diffusion, these methods lack the spatial correlation necessary to account for small-scale concentration heterogeneity. The work proposed here will replace random forcing used in stochastic Lagrangian models with a spatially-correlated stochastic forcing based on approximating the turbulent eddies by a set of random vortex structures.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe proposed research will develop a stochastic vortex structure (SVS) model for simulating collision and agglomeration of adhesive particles in turbulent flows. The SVS model will generate a turbulent velocity field with correct spatial correlation over a length scale interval ranging between the energy-containing turbulence integral  scale and a minimum scale that is associated with the length scale at which the eddy Stokes number is equal to unity. The proposed stochastic model will be validated by comparison to direct numerical simulations of particle agglomerate formation in homogeneous turbulence and turbulent shear flows. Simulations will be performed using a discrete element method for adhesive particles, a fast multipole method for solution of the vorticity-induced velocity field, and a pseudospectral method for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nAdhesive particles dominate critical problems ranging from bioengineering systems (blood flow, GI flows, microorganism suspensions), manufacturing processes (electrospray, electrocoating, dust mitigation), energy generation (pulverized coal combustion, biomass combustion, ash mitigation), environmental processes (sediment transport, volcanic processes, filtration processes), and nano- and microscale technology (nanoparticle dispersion, nanotube alignment, self-assembly). The proposed research will develop and validate a novel structurally-based stochastic model that will enable an entirely new simulation approach for a wide range of problems involving adhesive particles.\r\n\r\nThe research will be shared with a minority-serving institution via an existing arrangement between University of Vermont and City University of New York.",

Turbulent flows are typically simulated in engineering problems using so-called Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, which solve for the mean flow field and several measures of the turbulence fluctuations (e.g., turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate). Effective methods have priviously been developed for simulating the dispersion of non-interacting particles in turbulent flows. However, these methods are generally not applicable to problems involving phenomena such as collision, agglomeration, merger, clustering, or contact electrification of <em>interacting</em> particles or droplets.</p>\n<p>This project developed and validated a new synthetic turbulence method for transport of interacting particles in turbulent flows. In our stochastic vortex structure (SVS) method, the synthetic turbulence fluctuations are generated by a set of finite-length vortex structures which are positioned and oriented randomly in the flow field. The method was initially developed for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, and it was later extended to more general, anisotropic turbulent flows. By comparing the results of the SVS computations to results of direct numerical simulation (DNS), we demonstrated that the new SVS method accurately predicts a wide variety of measures of the fluid turbulence, which in homogeneous turbulence includes measures such as the energy spectrum and the probability density function for velocity, acceleration and vorticity. In computations with particles, we coupled the SVS method to a discrete element method (DEM) for the particles to show that the SVS method accurately predicts particle clustering and collision rate. For adhesive particles, the SVS method was shown to accurately predict measures such as average number of particles per agglomerate, agglomerate size distribution and agglomerate fractal dimensional in comparison to DNS results. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key advancement was the use of the fast multipole method to develop an accelerated version of the SVS method, which we have shown can increase computational speed by two orders of magnitude with almost no loss in accuracy. A multiscale SVS method was developed and tested, but the results were not found to be superior to the single-scale SVS method. In order to extend the SVS method to more general turbulent flows (such as turbulent shear flows), an inversion method was developed which can be used to preferentially orient the vortex structures so as to reproduce a given prescribed Reynolds stress field. This extended SVS method was validated against DNS results for particle transport in a planar turbulent jet flow. Measures of the turbulent flow and of particle dispersion, clustering and collision were shown to compare well between the SVS simulation and direct simulation results. The influence of different numerical parameters on the accuracy of the SVS predictions was also examined.</p>\n<p>We also performed a number of direct numerical simulations to better explore the limitations of the SVS method. Since it is assumed in the SVS method that all velocity fluctuations are induced by the vortex structures, the method is restricted to problems with one-way fluid-particle coupling. We conducted a series of simulations of the problem of agglomerate formation in turbulent flow using both one-way and two-way coupling approaches to examine the limitations of the one-way coupling approximation as agglomerate size increases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the SVS method was developed for transport of interacting particles in turbulent flows, we believe that this same method will be useful for simulating the effect of turbulence for aircraft simulators and for video games, where time variation of turbulence fluctuations on a moving object requires that the synthetic turbulence accurately resolves the turbulent fluctuations both temporally and spatially. We are in the process of examining the performance of the SVS method for aircraft simulator problems of this type.</p>\n<p>The research conducted through this project forms the basis of the thesis/dissertation research conducted by one Ph.D. student (male) and one M.S. student (female) at the University of Vermont. The research was also summarized in a monograph published by Cambridge University Press (Marshall and Li, 2014).
