 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this collaborative project is to reconstruct long-term and short-term changes in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using high-growth rate, precisely dated speleothems from caves in Borneo. Using the speleothems, the researchers would produce 150- to 300-year time series of changes in delta 18-Oxygen for five key time periods during the Holocene. \r\n\r\nThe research addresses several science questions, such as: 1) Was ENSO absent or just weaker in the early Holocene? 2) Did the frequency or magnitude of El Nino events change on centennial time scales during the late Holocene? 3) Were low-frequency changes in western equatorial Pacific precipitation driven by ENSO or by migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)? and 4) Can the impact of ENSO on tropical rain forest productivity be detected using speleotherm stable isotopic records?\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include the training off a female postdoctoral researcher and the mentoring of undergraduates involved with the research project.  Data would be archived at the National Climatic Data Center.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary source of interannual climate variability on a global basis.  Although the processes that govern El Ni&ntilde;o behavior today are well understood, climate model simulations of ENSO behavior in response to global warming yield an array of conflicting results due to the complex and counteracting climate feedbacks.   Reconstruction of El Ni&ntilde;o from geologic archives provide a unique perspective on long-term ENSO evolution.\n\nThe primary focus of this study was to reconstruct ENSO behavior at key intervals during the last 10,000 years (i.e. the Holocene epoch).  Estimates of past ENSO variability provide a baseline against which future changes can be judged and they also allow for estimates of ENSO sensitivity to modest changes in background climate during the Holocene.  Our reconstruction is based on a stalagmite from Malaysian Borneo. Stalagmites can be accurately dated and their oxygen isotopic composition can be used to infer rainfall variability over long timescales.   In Borneo, interannual rainfall variations are due primarily to ENSO.  Thus, the oxygen isotopic composition of the stalagmite can be used to infer ENSO activity in the geologic past. \n\nOur results show that ENSO variability was at its weakest during the mid-Holocene when there was an overall increase in the mean atmospheric convection and rainfall in Borneo.  Our data are consistent with coral records from the central and eastern equatorial Pacific that also show a mid-Holocene reduction in ENSO activity.   The simplest explanation of common changes in these two independent archives is a reduction in ENSO variance.  \n\nOur results suggest that increased atmospheric convection in Borneo associated with the mean climate state resulted in persistent easterly winds in the tropical Pacific, which in turn limits the development of El Ni&ntilde;o events.  It appears that the overall increase in atmospheric convection is related to variations in the earth's orbit and the associated seasonal changes in solar energy received in the tropics.  Thus, the available long-term records imply that ENSO is highly sensitive to modest changes in the seasonality of solar energy received in the tropics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David C Lund"
