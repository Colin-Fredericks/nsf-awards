 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award contributes support for a combined Gordon Research Conference on Soft Condensed Matter Physics: Bio-Soft Matter: Dynamical and Structural Complexity and Gordon Research Seminar to take place August 18 - 23, 2013, at Colby-Sawyer College, New London, New Hampshire. \r\n\r\nThe study of new materials has always been an important part of the physics of soft matter but currently it is taking center stage. A wide a range of length scales is a defining characteristic of soft matter. The resulting structural flexibility makes soft matter physics a prime discipline for the study of newly synthesized materials characterized by structural complexity. Soft matter systems also have a wide range of characteristic time scales making them a fertile ground for new materials with novel and interesting dynamical complexity. The importance of thermal fluctuations is a theme that unifies these two directions. Fundamental principles developed in soft matter physics, such as the statistical mechanics of self-assembly, are increasingly applied to biological systems. Conversely, bio-inspired approaches can be applied to construct and understand novel soft matter materials with various applications.\r\n\r\nThis Gordon Research Conference will bring together a wide range of practitioners and experts from condensed matter physics and other disciplines to assess the state-of-the-art and advance it through fruitful synergies. Recent developments in terms of new experimental data that has become available in the area of biologically inspired new materials as well as new theoretical advances make this a timely conference. A special session has been planned to highlight the connections between soft matter physics and other research communities. \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Soft Condensed Matter Gordon Research Conference will bring together an outstanding and diverse group of scientists at the forefront of research, and will make a special effort to include younger scientists and students. Specifically designed for junior participants, students and postdocs, a two-day Gordon Research Seminar will be held just before the main conference. This seminar will provide introductory lectures, and an opportunity for short talks in a peer-only environment, as well as a mentorship component. The organizers have made a strong effort to involve members of underrepresented groups among speakers and participants alike.",
