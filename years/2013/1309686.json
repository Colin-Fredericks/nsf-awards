 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a new class of miniaturized sensors-on-catheter\r\ntechnology through the integration of functional nanomaterials and flexible microsystems, for\r\nin situ blood pressure and flow monitoring with high sensitivity, fast recovery time and\r\nminimal invasiveness. In particular, we will develop highly aligned core-shell piezoelectric\r\nnanofibers based flexible thin film sensors patterned on catheter tips with dramatically\r\nreduced form factor, which are ready to be deployed in intra-vascular environment.\r\nIntellectual Merits: Real-time endovascular pressure measurement techniques are crucial to evaluate the hemodynamics, which indicates the physiological state of the cardiovascular system. \r\nWe propose a paradigm shift in designing the endovascular pressure sensing technology, through developing thin film flexible sensing structures using nanoengineered piezoelectric polymers which can be integrated on catheters without consuming its internal lumen space. Broader Impact: Development of versatile microsensors with built-in nanostructures as the core sensing elements can profoundly revolutionize the catheter development. In addition, the technology generated from this research can be extended to develop a broad class of flexible, robust, and biocompatible sensing nanomaterials with emergent behavior that work with the extraordinary effectiveness to quantify the biological processes. \r\n",
