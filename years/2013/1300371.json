 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Fran\u00e7ois Gabba\u00ef of the Chemistry Department at Texas A&M University, will investigate novel Lewis acids based on antimony.  The first class of compounds targeted in this project are cationic antimony(V) species (or stibonium ions) to be used in water for the detection of potentially toxic anions including fluoride and cyanide. These stibonium ions will be incorporated in conjugated and emissive frameworks to afford a family of compounds that will respond to the presence of the anions via distinct photophysical changes.  The second class will be halogenated, electron-deficient organostiboranes which will be designed to rival, if not exceed, the properties of perfluorinated organoboranes.  Unlike their boron analogs, these new organoelement Lewis acids should be resistant to oxidative conditions and will be used to study the complexation of reactive oxidizing anions such as peroxide and hypochlorite.  In addition, this award will contribute to the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and allow Professor Gabba\u00ef to maintain his involvement in various services and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nFrom a broader perspective, this project will have an impact on two main areas.  The first area deals with the detection of anions such as fluoride and cyanide, which can sometimes be found at toxic levels in drinking water.  The second important area that this project will impact concerns the chemistry of high energy molecules that are intermediates in important energy storage reactions.  The advances made in this project will be mostly fundamental but may contribute to the health of our society or to the development of new energy storage technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLewis acids are electron-pair acceptors which readily bind electron rich molecules and anions.  A cursory inspection of current developments in this field of chemistry shows that it is dominated by group 13 compounds, in particular electrophilic organoboranes that have become ubiquitous in synthesis, small molecule activation, catalysis and material science.  While it may be a general perception that strong Lewis acidity is the preserve of group 13 elements such as boron, the pioneering work of Olah has shown that strong Lewis acidity can also be expressed by group 15 elements, especially antimony.  Example of such antimony Lewis acids include the pentahalides which have been used to generate highly acidic media including magic acid.  However, like many main group halides, the use of these antimony pentahalides is complicated by their highly reactive and corrosive nature.  In particular, they react violently with water, releasing the corresponding hydrohalic acid.  An extension of the lessons learned in boron chemistry suggested to us that the introduction of organic substituents in antimony(V) compounds would afford strong Lewis acids that do not display the inconvenient corrosive properties of the pentahalide derivatives.  In this project, we have explored the validity of this idea, by first developing new synthetic approaches to organoantimony(V) compounds and by systematically investigating their Lewis acidic properties.  These efforts have resulted in the discovery of a novel class of Lewis acids which can be used in a range of applications including anion sensing as well as small molecule activation and capture.  Our work in the domain of anion sensing has led to the discovery of antimony-based fluorescent sensors which can be used to detect potentially toxic anions, including fluoride, in aqueous media at ppm concentrations.  We have also found that some of these antimony Lewis acids, when combined with a Lewis base, not only activate but also trap potentially toxic molecules such as formaldehyde.  Another important research outcome has been in catalysis, an area in which we have shown that the newly synthesized Lewis acids can be used, sometimes in concert with transition metals, to activate various organic reactions.\n\nThis project has contributed to the training of 14 graduate students. Five of these students, who have already obtained their graduate degree, are currently employed as postdoctoral fellows, as researchers in the chemical industry or as instructors in academic institutions.  All other students are currently enrolled in the Gabba&iuml; group and will graduate in the next 1-5 years.
