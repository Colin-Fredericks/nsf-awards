 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis award supports precise atomistic modeling of materials self-assembled from colloidal nanoscale components (nanoparticles, large molecules) in bulk solutions, at solution interfaces, and in the presence of electric fields. In collaboration with several experimental groups, the PI group will explore the exact conditions under which material systems can self-assemble from different colloidal nanocomponents, characterize the structure and properties of such self-assembled materials, and provide guidance for their future experimental preparation. Of particular interest is to prepare materials with active planar and spherical interfaces covered with nanoparticles and bio-molecules, where their self-assembly processes and overall activity can be controlled by pH, ionic strengths, and electric fields. \r\n\r\nThe research objectives of this work are:\r\n1) to study how functionalized nanoparticles and small proteins self-assemble in different solvents, at solvent interfaces, and in the presence of external fields, \r\n2) to evaluate the structure and material properties of such material self-assemblies, \r\n3) to decipher the rules which determine the conditions, under which the systems arrange in different conformations and phases, \r\n4) to closely correlate the experimental and computational studies, and guide the experimental studies to  explore possible applications of the materials.\r\n\r\nThe approach is to use large scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, parameterized by quantum ab-initio codes, to address the proposed objectives in materials formed by self-assembled nanoscale components. The simulations will be performed with the goal to collect atomically precise data about the studied systems, rigorously analyze the data, and disclose the necessary information from them. \r\n\r\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students will be actively engaged in these studies. They will write the codes, runs the simulations, analyze the data, visualize the obtained structures, and prepare the material for publications, presentations, and proposals for computation resources.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis award supports computational and theoretical research in the area of advanced materials formed by self-assembly of nanoscale components of inorganic and biological origins. The research will provide fundamental understanding and predictive modeling of the self-assembly process in three types of material systems: (a) colloidal nanoparticles at the interfaces of ionic solutions in electric fields, (b) hybrids of nanoparticles with proteins in ionic solutions, and (c) biologically-inspired non-spherical colloidal nanoparticles. The main aim of this research is to understand the conditions under which these systems form, guide experimentalists in their preparation and optimization, and examine the possible use of these systems in various industrial, energy, and biomedical applications. \r\n\r\nThe educational objectives are: 1) to prepare the next generation of professionals in nanoscience by direct teaching and research experience for graduate students, undergrads and high school teachers,  2) to promote access to science and technology to underrepresented groups of students by reaching women students at all levels through the WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) program at UIC, which includes the WISE Wing inhabitants and the K-12 teachers and students in the WIN (Women in Nanotechnology) program with Motorola and the US Department of Labor, and 3) to attract the general public to nanoscience.",

With this support, we have initiated and continued collaborations with more than a dozen of experimental groups around the world in the area of materials self-assembled from nanoscale components. Using this funding, we have published more than 20 papers in a number of journals, including Science, Nature Materials, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Chemistry, Nature Communications, ACS Nano, Nano Letters, JACS, and others. The research results were also presented at numerous conferences and National Meetings, including Gordon Research Conferences, Faraday Discussions, MRS and ACS Meetings, and others.

Some of these students graduated and left for postdoctoral positions (Berkeley, MIT, Argonne National Laboratory) or will do so in future.

In the modeling of self-assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, we had to develop new Monte Carlo codes to describe the formation of unique superstructures observed experimentally. The main research results (see Fig.1) were published in Science (2014) and Faraday Discussions (2015). Last year, the PI obtained additional NSF funding to separately continue in these studies, which are currently conducted along several directions. Currently, the PI is on a Visiting Professorship at the Weizmann Institute, where he conducts some of this research. Besides magnetic studies, we have also collaborated with the Klajn group on the self-assembly of nano-flasks from cis/trans-azobenzene covered nanoparticles (see Fig.2), which was published in Nature Nanotechnology (2016).</p>\n<p>2) We have also extensively collaborated with Prof Nicholas Kotov (UMICH) on modeling of various self-assembled superstructures of CdS nanoparticles. In Fig.3 (top), we show the formation of chiral superstructures formed by chiral nanoparticles, where the chirality is passed over from the nanoparticle to the whole self-assembled structure. This study was published in Nature Materials (2015). In a related work, we have explored the formation of hollow capsules by similar nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom) and published in Nature Chemistry (2016).</p>\n<p>3) The collaboration with Profs. Mark Schlossman (UIC) and Vince Rotello (UMASS) was also unique, as we have described a complex behavior of charged nanoparticles at the interfaces of different ionic solutions in the presence of electric fields (Nano Letters, 2014), as shown in Fig. 4. We are still continuing in the modeling of nanoparticles lattices formed in these systems and characterizing general solvation of nanoparticles.</p>\n<p>4) Recently, we have also modelled with Prof. Utkur Mirsaidov (NUS, Singapore) various self-assemblies as observed in their in-situ experiments. For example, we have described the crystallization of gold nanoparticles from solution, as shown in Fig.5 and published in Nature Chemistry (2016). We plan to expand this collaboration, since these observations have many possibilities for better understanding of self-assembly processes.</p>\n<p>5) Finally, we have also participated in various bio-related projects, often related with the development of novel nanomedical tools.
