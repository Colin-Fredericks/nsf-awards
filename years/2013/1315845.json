 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of this proposal are (1) to understand the time- and temperature-dependent cation ordering process recently documented in natural titanomagnetites; (2) to quantify the kinetics of the process and to develop a titanomagnetite-based geospeedometer; and (3) to understand and model the effects of cation ordering on magnetic properties and on the acquisition, retention, and demagnetization of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), partial thermoremanence (pTRM) and thermoviscous remanence (TVRM).  Newly acquired data demonstrate that natural titanomagnetites of common composition undergo temperature-dependent cation ordering at moderate temperatures (300-500\u00b0C) and over timescales of hours to months.  As a result, the magnetic Curie temperature (Tc) is a strong function of prior thermal history, changing by up to 150\u00b0C with no attendant chemical changes.  As (re-)ordering may take place at T < Tc, this clearly has profound implications for our understanding of TRM acquisition and stability, and may lead to increased uncertainty in absolute paleointensity estimates, as well as in paleomagnetic paleothermometry.  We propose to determine the nature of the cation ordering process in complex titanomagnetites via synthesis of samples of controlled composition, and characterization via powder X-ray diffraction, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The degree of order will then be directly linked to Curie temperature and other magnetic properties.  Isothermal annealing experiments will allow us to constrain the kinetics of the ordering process, and TC can then be calculated as a function of order for a given cooling path.  This titanomagnetite geospeedometer will be tested against natural samples from locations with known emplacement temperatures and cooling rates.  Finally, we will determine the effects of time- and temperature-dependent cation reordering on remanence acquisition and stability, as well as on paleointensity estimates, via a series of experiments with controlled thermal histories.  Laboratory data and models will be compared with observations on natural samples where cation ordering is expected to vary systematically with known cooling rates. \r\n\r\nMagnetization acquired by the iron-titanium oxide mineral titanomagnetite (frequently found in volcanic rocks) provides a vital source of information about geomagnetic field history and tectonic plate motions. Yet, there are fundamental aspects of titanomagnetite mineral magnetism that remain inadequately understood, particularly concerning the arrangement of metal cations (Fe2+, Fe3+, Ti4+, Mg2+, etc.) in the oxide crystal structure, how the cation arrangement may change with temperature, and resulting changes in important magnetic properties. It has been recently observed that natural titanomagnetites of common composition undergo temperature-dependent cation reordering at moderate temperatures (300-500\u00b0C) and over timescales of hours to months. This cation reordering affects the fundamental magnetic properties of the titanomagnetites, and influences the mechanisms through which they record the ambient magnetic field during cooling, thus introducing uncertainty into estimates of geomagnetic field intensity derived from titanomagnetite-bearing rocks.  The proposed work aims to understand this cation ordering process and the resulting effects on magnetization and magnetic properties.  Further, the proposed work will provide a greater understanding of uncertainty in commonly-used paleomagnetic estimates of temperatures associated with past geologic phenomena such as volcanic events or burial-related heating.  The results may be of wide interest in constraining emplacement temperatures and cooling rates in pyroclastic flows (PF) -- hot mixtures of volcanic gas, ash and rock fragments.  PFs constitute one of the most significant volcanic hazards, and slow cooling means the hazard may persist long after initial emplacement.  Very few direct temperature measurements of PFs have been made, and new methods for quantification of cooling rates and emplacement temperatures will help in hazard planning.",

PDCs are hot mixtures of volcanic gas, ash and rock fragments that travel rapidly down slope. Very few direct temperature measurements of PDCs have been made, and new methods for determining cooling rates and emplacement temperatures will help in hazard planning.\n \nOur approach to these problems combined further work on natural volcanic samples of widely-ranging compositions with work on synthetic titanomagnetites created in the laboratory.  Some natural samples were donated by colleagues.  More comprehensive sampling was undertaken at two volcanos:  Mt. St. Helens in Washington State, and Soufriere Hills in Montserrat, West Indies.  These two locations were chosen because PDCs were erupted in recent history, and scientists were able to directly measure the deposit temperatures immediately after eruption. This allowed us to compare our indirect methods of temperature estimation with actual temperature measurements. The synthetic titanomagnetites allowed us to control very precisely the composition of the titanomagnetite and also allowed us to work with a pure mineral instead of the mixture of minerals found in natural rocks.\n \nThe crystal structure of titanomagnetite can be characterized by two distinct types of \"sites\" in which the metal cations can be situated.  One way to produce some of the observed magnetic variations would be to change the distribution of the iron cations (Fe2+ and Fe3+) between these two sites.  However, our work with both the synthetic and natural samples demonstrated that the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the observed magnetic property variations was not related to this type of rearrangement of the iron cations, nor to rearrangement of the Mg or Al cations.  Instead, it appears to be related to oxidation and may result from a rearrangement of cations within one of the crystal sites.\n \nResults of laboratory experiments and modeling demonstrate that this effect can adversely influence certain types of common experiments designed to retrieve information on Earth?s magnetic field. In particular, it is likely to be a common cause of failure for experiments designed to recover the past strength of Earth?s magnetic field.  It may also negatively impact common experiments that allow researchers to estimate temperatures of PDC deposits based on the magnetization of the PDC rocks.\n \nHowever, we have developed a new method for recovering PDC deposit temperature.  Instead of relying on the magnetization held by volcanic rocks (essentially their magnetic memory), this technique uses variations in a certain magnetic property &ndash; the Curie temperature (Tc).  Tc is influenced by the thermal history of the rocks through the rearrangement of cations within the crystal structure.  PDCs emplaced at different temperatures have different cooling histories, and the Curie temperature of the PDC rocks will reflect that history.  Tests on the May 18, 1980 PDCs erupted at Mt. St. Helens demonstrate that this new technique allows us to accurately recover deposit temperatures.  Further, it allowed us to make temperature estimates from deeply buried deposits that had not been accessible to scientists immediately following the eruption.  This technique may ultimately allow researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the volcanic processes that result in PDCs, as well as the resulting hazards to population centers.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Jackson"
