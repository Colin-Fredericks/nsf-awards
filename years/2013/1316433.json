As the national school reform trend reduces time for science instruction in favor of reading across grades K-5, this research and development project, alternatively, is focused on accelerating both student science understanding and reading comprehension proficiency at the primary level (grades 1-2). The project is being implemented in diverse classrooms and addresses age-appropriate content from the areas of the physical, earth/environmental, and life sciences. The project is following a Cluster Randomized Trial (CRT) design with 16 experimental and 16 control schools and a total of 256 teachers/classrooms. Both groups are using the same District-adopted Reading/Language Arts program and are teaching the same District-adopted Science standards that are consistent with frameworks for state and national standards.",

The intervention was implemented through daily, 45 minute lessons in which a diverse group of students (e.g., 43% Hispanic, 16% African American, 58% Free-Reduced Lunch) across multiple classrooms engaged in a variety of age-appropriate learning activities focusing on core science concepts.

This project incorporated and combined two important interdisciplinary areas of research. These areas, namely cognitive science and instructional design, provided a strong framework for the design and implementation of Primary Science IDEAS. First, Primary Science IDEAS addressed the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) including its? 3-dimensional teaching model as the means by which the project was able to increase the time for science instruction across grades 1-2. Expanding instructional time for science instruction in grades 1-2 (and previously across grades 3-4-5) is an important element for preparing students for learning in science at the secondary level.\n\nSecondly, the framework supported the empirically-validated Primary Science IDEAS curricular strategy in which improving student reading comprehension proficiency was achieved by integrating literacy (e.g., reading and writing about science) within in-depth science instruction.

When the combination of the integrated Primary Science IDEAS science and literacy instructional model and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) curricular model is implemented within authentic classroom settings, school districts can begin to address the persistent issues associated with poor achievement trends in early science learning and reading achievement.
