The schedule of the Loops Workshop is flexible to encourage open discussion by its participants. Furthermore, the Loops Workshops have a well-deserved reputation for allowing the younger generation to assume relevant roles in the community and the scientific discussions. An open mailing list developed by the Coronal Loops Workshop community communicates with over 170 scientists worldwide, allowing those researchers to continuously exchange ideas, new results, publications, and information on coronal loops research. The workshop has traditionally been supportive of the attendance and participation of Ph.D. students and young postdocs.",
