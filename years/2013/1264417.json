Interorganizational networks enable constituencies to transcend some limitations and work toward common goals.\r\n\r\nThis research combines social network analysis methods with intensive assessment to (a) produce a reliable and valid measure of NGO capacity, and (b) test the common presumption that an NGO's capacity to address problems of disease and development is dependent on its local network of relationships with other NGOs, businesses, and government organizations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will include an important new outcome measure for NGO research. In addition, this project will identify the types of collaboration associated with increasing an NGO's scope of services, leadership strength, human resource capacity, financial stability, and research and advocacy capacity. This should have practical implications for better management of NGOs in context.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCAREER: The Impact of Interorganizational Network Evolution on Outcomes for Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) examined the relationship between NGO, nongovernment organization (NGO) capacity and interorganizational network portfolios of NGO. NGO capacity is defined as the processes, practices, and people that the organization has at its disposal that enable it to produce, perform, or deploy resources to achieve its mission. This definition highlights that capacity ultimately is about an ability to accomplish organizational goals and mandates. In particular, a NGO?s capacity is linked to its ability to achieve its mission. Interorganizational network portfolios describe the number, type, character, and duration of relationships that organizations strategically maintain.\n\nThis research is important to scholars, funders, and policy makers. Scholars have been interested in the ways that NGO collaboration, including collaboration with other NGOs, businesses, and government agencies, influences organizational outcomes. Funders and policy makers are interested in the question because they have been encouraging NGO collaboration, without evidence that it yields better social service and NGO outcomes.\n\nThis 5-year project resulted in 17 academic publications and products. Three of these products are particular significant. The first was the development and validation of the NGO Capacities Instrument, a 49-item measure of eight NGO capacities.
