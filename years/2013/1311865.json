 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating molecular sieve and fluorescent sensing technology to fill handheld, ultrasensitive explosive detection technology gap. The translated molecular sieve and fluorescent sensing technology has the following unique features: fast concentration of explosive vapors through size-exclusion and signal-amplified fluorescence quenching ('molecular wire') that provides cost-effective, handheld, rapid and naked-eye based ultrasensitive detection of a range of military explosives when compared to the leading competing portable explosives detection technologies such as Ionscan, RedXDefense and Fido XT in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by integrating a simple pre-concentrator membrane with ultrasensitive nanofibrous sensing membrane resulting in a low-cost, handheld prototype device to rapidly 'read-out' ultra-trace quantities of explosives by naked eye under UV light. \r\n\r\nThe partnership engages Swedish Explosive Ordinance Disposal and Demining Center and University of Connecticut Technology Transfer Center to provide guidance in the explosive vapor detection market and other aspects of financing and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the integrated handheld explosives pre-concentrator/sensor device along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to generate revenue through manufacturing and sale of the products to the military and demining companies in the next two to three years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in handheld explosives detection market. The societal impact, long term, will be to bring the capabilities of (or beyond) canine detection into the hands of first responder and security personnel, thus protecting civilians and the environment.",
