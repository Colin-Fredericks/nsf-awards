 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso will conduct a research project that implements and documents the impact of co-generative dialogues on youth learning and youth-scientist interactions as part of a STEM research program. Co-generative dialogues seek to specifically assist with communication and understanding among collaborators. Over four years, 108 11th grade youth from a predominantly (90%) Hispanic high school will conduct STEM research with six scientists (three chemists, two engineers, and one geologist) and graduate students as part of year-long afterschool and Saturday programing, followed by an intensive month-long, self-directed research project in the summer. Half of the youth each year will be randomly assigned to co-generative dialogue treatment; the other half will participate in the program without the intervention. The scientists and three STEM graduate students will participate in both experimental and control groups, with different youth. Youth will receive high school credit to encourage participation and retention.\r\n\r\nThe PI team hypothesizes that co-generative dialogues will result in improved learning, communication, and research experiences for both youth and scientists. Educational researchers, including three education graduate students, will conduct co-generative dialogues, observations, interviews, and surveys using validated instruments to address the following research goals: \r\n1.\tTo investigate the impact of the treatment (co-generative dialogues) on youth knowledge, attitudes, perceptions of their experience, and their relationships with the scientists.\r\n2.\tTo investigate the impact of the treatment on scientists and graduate students.\r\n3.\tTo identify critical components of the treatment that affect youth-scientist interactions.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that, in addition to providing in-depth STEM research experiences for 108 youth from underrepresented groups at a critical time in their lives, the project will result in widely applicable understandings of how pedagogical approaches affect both youth learning and scientist experiences. The project also seeks to bridge learning environments: informal, formal, university and digital.",

Several challenges, however, hinder partnerships between students and scientists, including power-over, intimidation issues, and communication barriers. To advance student-scientist partnerships, this project introduced an innovative communication form&mdash;cogenerative dialogues (cogens)&mdash;into informal science education, in general, and students&rsquo; partnerships with scientists, in particular. Cogens are conversations cogenerated by the various stakeholders to reflect participants&rsquo; experiences and help them to reach collective decisions about the rules, roles, and responsibilities that govern their partnerships. In the past, most studies on cogens were undertaken in school settings. This is the first study to introduce, and implement the concept of, cogens to the community of scientists in an internship setting.</p>\n<p>In this pioneering study on the use of cogens in a science internship, cogens were most frequently used to identify and address challenges as a team. The three most salient challenges were the quality and progress of scientific practice in laboratories (e.g., safety rules, time or material limitations), the quality of scientists&rsquo;/assistants&rsquo; instructions in classrooms (e.g., teaching pace, methods), and the quality of student participation in classrooms and homework (e.g., critical thinking, procrastination). Cogens allowed students and scientists to agree on the teaching modifications that positively influenced teaching and learning processes during the internship. Interestingly, students were more willing than were scientists to discuss their own issues related to improvement. That is, issues about the quality of scientists&rsquo;/assistants&rsquo; instructions in classrooms were raised many by students, and only a few were raised by scientists. This finding shows that students were not afraid to bring up teaching issues for discussion.</p>\n<p>In terms of cogens&rsquo; impact on students, we do not find a significant influence on their interest in and attitudes toward science or scientific knowledge or their views on the nature of science. Students who learned science in the internship, however, developed significantly stronger constructivist learning perceptions than did those who learned science in school. That is, students perceived that they had more opportunities to think independently of the instructors and other students in the internship. As for participants&rsquo; experiences with cogens, both high school students and scientists had positive experiences overall. They noted that cogens allowed participants to work as a team to improve science internship teaching and learning, provided a respectful and supportive space where participants could voice their perspectives, allowed students and scientists to demonstrate care and foster a stronger bond between them, and provided opportunities for participants to receive constructive criticism and improve themselves as individuals. Participants sometimes had difficulties, however, coming up with ideas for cogens, and cogen mediators did not always facilitate the dialog effectively.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this mixed method research suggests that cogens help both students and scientists to transform the challenges in their internship into opportunities for becoming active learners, critical thinkers, and collaborative researchers. The purposeful discussion of various challenges in cogens allows participants to deeply reflect on their understandings about learning, teaching, and scientific practice and to disrupt their existing paradigms to negotiate new meanings and understandings to support students&rsquo; science learning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts:</p>\n<p>This project involved collaboration with one university, one school district, and three local high schools to conduct a research project that provided a seven-month internship for three cohorts of high school students. In total, the project engaged 12 scientists (e.g., chemist, geologist, biologist, neuroscientist, immunologist, engineer), 23 science research assistants (university graduate or undergraduate students), 42 education research assistants (university graduate or undergraduate students), three high school teachers, and 179 high school students (117 internship students and 62 students who served as a control group). These three cohorts of internship students, working two to three students as a group, conducted 62 scientific projects and presented their proposals and results in six open-house events, which involved 720 visitors of scientists, school principals, teachers, a superintendent, a deputy superintendent, students&rsquo; families, and friends.</p>\n<p>Project personnel created a website to distribute updates and results throughout the project&rsquo;s life span (<a href=\"http://workwithascientist.utep.edu\">http://workwithascientist.utep.edu</a>). Moreover, journalists wrote 14 news articles about the project that were presented on the university website, the school district website, and the community media website as well as in the community newspaper (<a href=\"http://workwithascientist.utep.edu/newsroom.html\">http://workwithascientist.utep.edu/newsroom.html</a>). The project resulted in five top peer-reviewed journal articles in science education, three master&rsquo;s students&rsquo; theses, one book chapter, and five conference papers. In terms of professional trainings, project personnel held five workshops and five meetings to train 35 science professionals to conduct cogenerative dialogues, 159 weekly meetings to train 42 assistants to conduct educational research, and three workshops to share the project findings and enhance the professional development of 47 inservice teachers and 10 preservice teachers. Moreover, project personnel distributed project findings through 13 presentations at international conferences, 13 at regional conferences, and one at an NSF PI meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/08/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pei-Ling&nbsp;Hsu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047061347_5-Cogen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047061347_5-Cogen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cogenerative Dialogues\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047061347_5-Cogen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cogenerative Dialogues\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cogenerative Dialogues - Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pei-Ling&nbsp;Hsu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cogenerative Dialogues</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047003610_3-Internship--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047003610_3-Internship--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Internship Activity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539047003610_3-Internship--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Internship Activity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Internship Activity - Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pei-Ling&nbsp;Hsu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Internship Activity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539046938276_1-Orientation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539046938276_1-Orientation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Internship Orientation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322600/1322600_10283589_1539046938276_1-Orientation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Internship Orientation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Internship Orientation - Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Work With A Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pei-Ling&nbsp;Hsu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Internship Orientation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
