The ?Alliance? is a high-level body composed of leaders of the leaders of international organizations committed to finding solutions to the world?s most pressing questions about the future sustainability of the planet. These organizations include composed of representatives from the ISSC, ICSU, UN, UNEP, UNU, and WMO (as an observer).  The Alliance works to ensure that the results of multi-disciplinary research are accessible to decision makers concerned with the sustainability of the planet.  The Alliance seeks to foster unprecedented collaboration between the natural, social, economic, engineering, and human sciences, the Alliance will contribute to the creation of creative, bold, and integrated solutions for global sustainability.  \r\n\r\nThe seed funding will be used to support the work of the secretariat, which will provide:\r\n1. A platform for expanding the Alliance, including creation of the Alliance Forum, which extends the Alliance to the global business community.\r\n2. A means for Alliance members to meet and create a strategic plan for the Alliance.\r\n3. A visible presence for the Alliance through development of communications materials and strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance secretariat will help the Alliance fulfill its mission to drive and facilitate the co-design, co-production and co-delivery of knowledge with relevant stakeholders in order to address and create solution pathways for global sustainability problems.  The first major activity of the Alliance is the establishment of ?Future Earth?, a 10-year initiative on Earth System research for global sustainability. This initiative will bring together and build on the strengths of existing international global environmental change program and incorporates the outcomes of recent visioning and agenda-setting processes led by the Alliance members.",

The Forum is designed to support the Alliance\u00c6s flagship initiative, Future Earth. \n\nThe first Future Earth Forum was held on September 24, 2014 at the State University of New York Global Center in Manhattan, New York City, immediately following the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23, 2014. \n\nThe Forum focused on bringing together key leaders from science, industry, business, finance, media, and representative from non-for profits and civil society to discuss common needs and approaches with a thematic emphasis on managing \"systemic risk\" and a goal to generate actionable research and implementable solutions.\n\nMost of the impacts of the Forum fall within the category of broader impacts as they deal with questions of how to generate and use science to benefit society (as can be seen throughout this report). However, through these discussions Forum attendees are generating new knowledge related to how multi-stakeholders, so often isolated in their \"silos\" of expertise or interest, work with eachother to manage complex and wicked sustianability issues.\n\nMatching Needs and Capabilities\n\nThe event was designed as a forum where science listens and responds to requirements stemming from society at large, leading towards the co-production of the necessary knowledge for the future. The Forum\u00c6s dynamic first intervention was made by Peter Bakker who discussed the need for new knowledge generation for businesses worldwide. \n\nAfter this \"call to arms\" from the business community Frans Berkhout described the capabilities of the \"huge international scientific efforts\" to date and pointed out some failings.\n\nA clear alignment of common interests emerged from the ensuing discussion.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Bakker\u00c6s framing: Needs of   businesses\n\n\n\nFrans Berkhout\u00c6s framing: Capabilities   of Science\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate best possible facts\nGenerate fundamental, breakthrough   research (new energy sources)  \nFind bridge between science, business,   and civil society (risk)  \nProduce short analyses that business   people can read\nDrive solutions that scale behavioral   change \n\n \nCommunicate science \nDo frontier science \nEngage policy in science  \nInform scientific funding agenda \nBuild scientific capacity \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSustainability, Systemic Risk, and the Science Agenda\n\nThe next discussion section was moderated by Scott Williams and featured Peter Bakker, Johan Rockstr&ouml;m, Rowan Douglas and Molly Jahn, and focused on systemic risk as a natural and \"safe\" convening place for the science-society dialog and co-design. During the ensuing discussion a clear consensus emerged that Future Earth needed to step up to an entirely new challenge: that of creating a meta-community to build the knowledge base to address global and regional systemic risks, without falling into the trap of crossing \"red lines\" of unethical or non-rigorous scientific work. \n\n Messaging a Response to Global Environmental Challenges\n\nThis section was expertly moderated by Andrew Revkin and involved Porter Bibb, Jordan Peterson, and Marcus Ribeiro.  All speakers agreed that a major change in communications strategy was required for Future Earth to fulfil its potential. In the discussion there emerged the concept of pairing the Future Earth \"Brain Trust\" with a \"Do-Trust\", exciting the public with a solutions oriented action agenda.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, there was emphasis placed on boundary navigation, dealing with such questions as: Where in the value chain of basic research to applied solutions to social action does Future Earth belong &ndash; and where should it not venture? What tone, channels, and modalities should be used in the co..."
