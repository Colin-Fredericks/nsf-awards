 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, investigators from UNC Charlotte are building a software\r\ninfrastructure named ``BRIDGES\" (Bridging Real-world Infrastructure\r\nDesigned to Goal-align, Engage and Stimulate) to transform student\r\nexperiences in computing education. The primary goal of the project is to\r\nimprove retention of CS majors, especially at the sophomore level. BRIDGES\r\nfacilitates a hands-on experience for solving traditional problems in computer\r\nscience using real-world information systems, such as Facebook, Twitter,\r\nGoogle Maps, etc.  BRIDGES is being integrated into two computer science\r\nrequired courses, the senior capstone course and the sophomore level\r\ndata structures and algorithms course, enabling a senior-sophomore bridge.\r\nSophomore and senior students in these courses will partner in joint lab\r\nsessions to utilize and create new extensions to the BRIDGES infrastructure\r\nto support data structures programming assignments. Sophomores will act as\r\ncustomers for the new tools and data sets created by seniors and use them in\r\ntheir course programming assignments.  In this manner, BRIDGES will create a\r\nmore connected student body by partnering sophomores and seniors, which\r\nshould lead to improved student retention and engagement. BRIDGES is\r\nbeing built using open source and web technologies, promoting easy\r\ndissemination. Two workshops on the BRIDGES system will be held,\r\ninvolving educators from regional colleges and high schools, including\r\nminority and underrepresented institutions.  An additional workshop will be\r\nheld associated with a major education conference. Students from the STARS Alliance (an NSF funded Broadening Participation in Computing consortium) will be given access to the learning materials and infrastructure to incorporate into their outreach and teaching activities.",
