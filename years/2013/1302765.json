 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aaron Geller is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Northwestern University.  The fellow's project involves exoplanets.  Today, astronomers are discovering a rich panoply of exoplanets in our Galaxy.  Many of these exoplanets are in multi-planet systems.  Some show surprisingly different characteristics from our own Solar System that pose serious problems for standard isolated planet formation theories.  Strong evidence indicates that the majority of stars form in clusters, many of which dissolve within the age of the Universe.  Therefore, many of the exoplanets observed today---in stars clusters and the field of the Galaxy---may have been born inside star clusters and subjected to past perturbations from nearby stars.  Understanding how stellar encounters within this birth environment affect the dynamical evolution of planetary systems is paramount to interpreting the characteristics of all the newly discovered exoplanets and how these relate to the planet formation epoch. \r\n\r\nTo address these important questions, the fellow work with a team of experts to complete development of the first computer code to self-consistently simulate the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems in realistic star clusters.  Dr. Geller and collaborators have already completed a pilot code demonstrating the feasibility of the most critical and innovative components, and the full code will be completed early in the first year of the fellowship.  The fellow will then use this code to model nine open star clusters, including four in the Kepler field that have been surveyed comprehensively for transiting exoplanets.  Each cluster will be modeled with multiple different initial planet populations to cover the range in characteristics of observed exoplanets.  The simulations will be analyzed, accounting for the unique sensitivity limits of each transit survey, and the results will be compared directly with the observations.  This project will reveal---for the first time self-consistently---how stellar encounters within star clusters of a wide range in age, density, mass, etc., influence the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems including those like our Solar System and how the characteristics of exoplanets observed today in both clusters and the field may have been modified in the past by their birth environment.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach in partnership with the Northwestern's NSF-funded GK-12 and CE21 programs to develop, test, and disseminate about 15 high school lesson plans based on the scientific research of this project.  The fellow will work directly with a Northwestern graduate student to develop around five classroom-tested high school lesson plans each year.  To supplement the lesson plans, the fellow will also develop a web-based student-friendly interface to both analyze the products of the proposed simulations and to allow students to run simulations of their own.  During years 2 and 3 the fellow will integrate these lesson plans into teacher professional development workshops, which the PI will co-lead.  Through these workshops, the fellow will train  about 20 Chicago Public School and area teachers to use his lesson plans, thereby reaching about 2000 students with his curricular materials by the end of the fellowship.  Both the GK-12 and CE21 programs are well established at Northwestern University and have been running successfully for years.  This is a natural and mutually beneficial partnership that will help train the fellow for a future career teaching computational thinking methods in undergraduate physics and astronomy courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n \n\nMost stars are born in groups, known as star clusters, containing hundreds up to millions of stars.  These stellar families are born out of the same gas cloud at about the same time.  On a smaller scale, most stars are born with (at least) one close companion star, known as a binary, where two stars orbit about their mutual center of gravity.  Also, most stars are thought to be born with planetary systems.  Indeed, our Sun and solar system is believed to have been born in a cluster initially containing a few thousand stars.   Over time, most star clusters dissolve, dispersing these stellar families throughout the Galaxy.  This happened to our Sun and its birth cluster billions of years ago.  However, star clusters can be violent and hazardous environments, where close encounters between stars and planets can be frequent.  Life within a star cluster can alter the characteristics and architectures of stellar and planetary systems away from what they were born with.\n\n \n\nThis project studied the impact of such clustered birth environments on the present-day characteristics of stars and planets (for instance those that we observe with telescopes on the ground and in space), in order to better understand the birth processes and lives of star and planet systems. To do so, my collaborators and I used both observations of real stars in star clusters and sophisticated computer simulations of star clusters. \n\n \n\nOur observations of star clusters continue to help define the binary-star populations in star clusters, and particularly in \"open\" star clusters (those that generally contain thousands of stars, and can have a wide range in ages).  In open clusters, binary stars participate in most stellar encounters.  Therefore, empirically understanding the binary populations are to producing accurate star cluster models, and to our general understanding of star cluster dynamics.   We have also studied the \"exotic\" blue straggler and sub-subgiant stars. Our papers on the sub-subgiant stars are the first to catalogue and analyze these stars as a population. We find that the open clusters have more sub-subgiants per unit mass than the more massive (and older) globular clusters.  We suggest that the sub-subgiants may be created through interacting binaries and also, in some cases, through stellar collisions.  Exotic stars like blue stragglers and sub-subgiants are key tests of our theory of stellar evolution, which underpins much of astrophysics.\n\n \n\nOur observations and simulations are also revealing that open clusters are, in many ways, more dynamically active than their higher-mass \"globular\" cluster counterparts, per unit cluster mass.  This is different from the standard view in which globular clusters are seen as the most dynamically active (because they have more stars).  The reason for this paradigm shift is that open clusters can have a much higher fraction of binary stars and also binaries with much more widely separated stars.  Therefore, encounters are more frequent in open clusters than previously thought, and often these encounters can involve four or more stars, which leads to more frequent stellar collisions, creation of exotic stars, and the formation of more complex stellar systems.\n\n \n\nWe have also developed a new and unique star cluster simulation code that can accurately follow all the relevant physical mechanisms defining the lives of planetary systems within star clusters.  We are currently generating model star clusters using this code.  The simulations will provide an important step forward in our understanding of how stellar encounters within clustered stellar environments affect the orbits of planetary systems. \n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impact:\n\n \n\nI have worked with Northwestern PhD students and teachers at local high schools and community colleges to develop lesson plans for the high school and Astro-100 level classroom based on my research.  We?ve taken our lessons to the local Chicago Public High Schools as well as Chicago City (Community) Colleges and the College of DuPage (another local community college).  All of these schools serve underrepresented groups in STEM, first generation college goers, and students from socio-economic backgrounds that are not well represented in STEM careers.  These lesson plans are still in use by these teachers and within programs at Northwestern, and are freely available to the public.  \n\n \n\nI also continue to work with the Adler Planetarium?s Space Visualization Lab to develop visualizations and interactive tools to help share my research with the public.  I regularly interact with museum goers, and my videos and interactives are in regular use by other astronomers in the Adler (and most are available on my website).  Finally, I helped to start a Chicago \"Astronomy on Tap\" chapter (events at local pubs where we discuss astronomy and hold trivia contests for the public).   I personally developed our AoT Chicago logo(s).  This is an ongoing, monthly activity that will continue well beyond the duration of this grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron M Geller"
