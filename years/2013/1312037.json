This award also provides support for the U.S. National committees (USNC) to each of these Unions.  The role of the USNC's is to facilitate participation of American scientists in the activities of the international unions, engage the U.S. community in advancing geosciences in the U.S. and abroad; establish strong links to and foster communications with the respective international unions; exercise U.S. leadership in these unions; develop a globally aware U.S. geoscience community that collaborates internationally; and support the development of early-career U.S. geoscientists.",
