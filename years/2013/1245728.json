 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to supplement traditional teaching methods in Transportation Engineering with well-designed and novel games. The project follows a cyclic approach to the design and implementation of games for several transportation engineering classes, creating curriculum modules that combine the games, assignments and student assessments. These modules are being evaluated for their effectiveness in promoting student learning gains and engagement in transportation engineering. The curriculum modules are being shared through a website that can be used by faculty members at other universities. The focus of this project is not only on developing the tools, but also on increasing educators understanding of students' learning outcomes and effective game teaching methods. The intellectual merit of the project includes creating new pedagogical methods for teaching critical concepts in transportation engineering. The instructional modules are being developed in tandem with assessment in order to produce effective learning tools that will improve engineering education for transportation engineering programs. The broader impacts include increased understanding of critical driver behavior and other transportation issues that can reduce a significant percentage of crashes and save lives.",

Simulation software can be used to form a virtual lab that allows students to explore. However, learning the simulation software is as hard, if not harder, as learning the concepts in transportation engineering itself. An intuitive interface between the simulation software and the students is needed. Customized developed games can be a good interface to show the students enough but not too much information with pleasant learning experience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>In this project, we developed five games targeting concepts in pavement design, highway design, traffic safety, traffic control, and traffic planning. These games are hosted in a website server. Students can play these games online after they register and login. The server stores the users&rsquo; information and their gameplay data. A record of gameplay data includes the user name, the game played, the level number in the game, the game parameters (e.g., the game scores), and the time that record was generated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>The first game (Transporters) is focused on traffic planning. The Transporters game uses the four step model (a conventional traffic forecasting model) to evaluate the player&rsquo;s design choices. The game gives the players visual feedback by highlighting the resulting congested road segments with red color and the uncongested roads with green color.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>The second game (Angry Curves) targets specific concepts in highway design. Players need to design the road curvature elements with given design constrains. If the highway was designed properly, the game will show an animation of vehicles running on the designed highway nicely. If the design does not meet the safety requirement, the game will show an animation of vehicles being thrown away by the highway.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>The third game (Road Crush) is a game targeting concepts in pavement design. Players need to design a segment of pavement by dragging the material tiles into proper layers and adjusting the thickness of each layer. Vehicles will stop moving and a crack will be shown in the pavement if the design does not meet the requirements.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>The fourth game (DZ-Man) targets safety aspects related to dilemma zone (DZ). DZ is the area where drivers cannot decide whether to stop or to go when approaching an intersection at the onset of yellow indication. Players mimic the operation of modern traffic controllers to control the traffic light and decide when to end the green. Vehicles caught in DZ will be shown in red, while other vehicles will be shown in green to indicate successful operation.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fifth game (Time-Space Invaders) targets the coordinated signal control concepts related to traffic progression on roadways. Players manually adjust the start of green of each intersection relevant to other intersections. A corresponding time-space graph shows how good the resulting traffic progression is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>We conducted a Before-and-After study to test the effectiveness of the games for improving students&rsquo; understanding of the targeting concepts. Students were given lectures on specific topics in the &ldquo;Introduction to Transportation&rdquo; course. They were then asked to finish a set of untimed quizzes related to a topic taught in the class. Students played a corresponding game as many time as they wanted before attempting the same quizzes again. No feedback was given to the students regarding their performance in the pre-game quizzes. This process was designed so that the only factor that can affect improvement in their scores is the gameplay between the two sets of quizzes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>We conducted studies for DZ-Man in 2014 and 2015 and a study for Angry Curves in 2015. Statistical analysis showed that the students&rsquo; average quiz scores increased by 1 point (out of 7 points for Angry Curves game and 10 points for DZ-Man game) in all cases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><span>We presented these games in several conferences to different communities including the transportation engineering community, the engineering education community, and higher education community.
