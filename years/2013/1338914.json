The proposed center will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies (CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications. \r\n\r\nThe mission of the new Center would be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to use their established relationship with leading organizations to broadcast the research results and recruit new members through the organization channels. The PIs plan to develop new curriculum within existing degree programs at the three sites, and to continue their diversity traditions to include minorities and other underrepresented groups in center activities",
