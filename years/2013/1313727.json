 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mediterranean region has one of the longest histories of intensive human use of any part of the world.  In some areas, this has led to severe environmental degradation; in other areas, productive landscapes of farms, pastures, towns, and natural areas have been maintained for thousands of years.  This project will collect archeological data on ancient human land use, vegetation, and land form at four Neolithic sites in Spain and Italy.  These data will guide the development of models of social and natural processes that will attempt to predict the long-term outcomes of alternative patterns of land use.  The predictions will be checked against new knowledge of what has actually happened over centuries of use.  Based on these checks, the models will be refined to simulate the feedbacks through which human decisions are affected by land cover and terrain, vegetation is affected by land use and landscape change, and the land surface and soils are affected by land cover and use.\r\n\r\nBy increasing our ability to learn from the past, this project will help the U.S. plan for more sustainable agriculture and development of towns and cities.  To help disseminate results, the modeling software created will be available on line.  The extensive educational component of the project comprises extensive training of undergraduate and graduate students including members of groups under-represented in science, a summer program to train K-12 teachers to use models of landscape change, and the incorporation of findings into courses at four universities.",

In many respects, the western Mediterranean embodies fundamental questions of sustainability: How can the earth sustain a human population rapidly growing toward 10 billion and not only maintain human life but also quality of life? How can we successfully manage a continually changing landscape driven by interacting human and natural forces to make this goal possible? This project has worked to answer such questions through research on the emergence and subsequent dynamics of coupled natural and human landscapes in the western Mediterranean. It seeks a better understanding of how social and biophysical systems became so closely coupled, and the cascade of consequences from this coupling.\n\nTo achieve these broader goals, this project carried out an integrative, interdisciplinary program of field and laboratory research to collect and analyze archaeological and paleoecological data from intensive study regions in Spain and Italy. Analysis of the materials collected during fieldwork enabled the reconstruction of long-term dynamics of land use practices and landscape consequences. These empirical data were augmented by computational modeling experiments on the recursive processes that drive human and natural landscape dynamics using a unique laboratory of dynamically coupled model components to represent small-holder farmer/herder decision making, land use, anthropogenic and natural fire, vegetation community succession, and multi-dimensional landscape evolution. The empirical data also helps validate model results, especially through an innovative protocol to generate digital proxy data that can be directly compared with empirical data sets.\n\nThis project has supported the work of numerous graduate and undergraduates in the US, Canada, and Spain. It has supported one MA thesis, four completed PhD dissertations and two still in progress, and two postdoctoral scholars.\n\nThis highly interdisciplinary project exemplifies how coupled natural and human (CNH) systems research requires scientists with diverse and complementary expertise to collaborate to address important, complex issues. It also shows how historical sciences like archaeology and paleoecology, in combination with computational modeling can inform the present and help us navigate challenges of the future. It further demonstrates the importance of developing integrative science that treats human and biophysical phenomena as a single, complexly intertwined system.
