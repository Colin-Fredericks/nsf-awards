 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do new norms concerning resource management spread?  Norm entrepreneurs  are people who are well-positioned and active in advocating for new norms.  The role of norm entrpereneurs has not been considered in voluntary resource management practices; instead, current research indicates that these decisions are driven primarily by economic and personal considerations. However, social influence theory suggests that social influence plays an important but overlooked role in spreading norms. Neighbors, private associations, and public management officials are some of the significant norm entrepreneurs in resource management. Interviews with private resource owners will be conducted to ask how decisions are made, who influences these decisions, and where owners obtain information about strategies. Interviews with select officials will also be conducted to ask about interactions within the community, advice provided, and outreach methods employed. \r\n\r\nThe project's intellectual merit rests in its development of the concept of norm entrepreneurs in a setting with many individual decisionmakers, and in a natural resource context.  This project will explain how such social influence impacts individual resource owners' decision-making.  Using incentives to encourage voluntary adoption of  practices has been shown to be a socially acceptable alternative to state or federally mandates implemented through regulations. This research will explore the likelihood of enrolling in voluntary incentive programs, the level and type of incentive required to elicit enrollment, and the degree to which social influence can encourage greater levels of enrollment. The project's broader impacts are substantial; the results will be applicable to a wide range of  regions with an interest in implementing alternative regulation methods for natural resource management.  Effective natural resource management on private lands is a question of great economic importance.",

Non-industrial private forest owners (NIPFOs) own approximately 40% of the forestland in the WUP. NIPFO activity impacts forest sustainability in a very complex way. Individual NIPFOs are too small to significantly impact the landscape on their own but collectively NIPFOs can cause serious damage, such as creating large gaps in the forest harmful to wildlife and plant diversity. NIPFOs are also difficult to regulate because their land-use activities are legal and it is nearly impossible to design or enforce a law that makes a legal land-use activity illegal once a certain number of others take the same action at the same time. This is why voluntary incentive programs (VIPs) were created to coordinate NIPFOs. VIPs use incentives (tax breaks, free technical assistance, etc.) to encourage forest owners to adopt sustainable forest management practices. Since they are voluntary, VIPs can only work well when enrollment rates are high but VIPs in the WUP are consistently under-enrolled so their ability to impact forest sustainability remains low. Our study explores why this is happening. We conducted interviews with NIPFOs in the WUP to understand how they make land-use decisions, where they get their forest management information, and what they think about existing VIPs. We also interviewed leaders of local land management associations to ask about efforts to enroll NIPFOs in VIPs or to encourage best management practices.</p>\n<p>Our study found that many NIPFOs were simply unaware of VIPs and tended to get forest management information from informal sources (friends, neighbors, and family members).

Interviewees most likely to claim they owned their forest for financial gain were also more likely to be enrolled in the most active VIP in the region (the Commercial Forest Reserve program which manages lands for timber production).
