 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 400,000 tons of petroleum hydrocarbons are released annually into the ocean, where they are subject to physical, chemical and biological processes, known as weathering, that are known to remove select hydrocarbons from the ocean. However, little attention has been given to the residues left by the weathering of oil, and studies indicate that oxygenation of these hydrocarbons can play a part in the formation of recalcitrant tar and toxic compounds. To address this gap, researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Mary Washington, and University of California Santa Barbara will conduct research to lay a scientific foundation for understanding 1) which processes control the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons, 2) the rates of these processes, 3) the identity of the major products, 4) the rates at which they are formed and destroyed, and 5) for distinguishing photochemical oxygenation from biological oxygenation. The results from these experiments will contribute to a better understanding of the petroleum oxygenation processes and the environmental fate of understudied oxygenation products.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This study will provide for several undergraduates and two postdoctoral scholars to be trained in innovative analytical and experimental techniques. The results of this effort will help regulatory agencies to define new analytical methods and target compounds for oil spill research, and will add to our understanding regarding the fate and impacts of hydrocarbons released into the ocean.",

Along with new, fundamental knowledge about oil spill science, our research also provided four undergraduate students with professional laboratory and field training on oil sampling and advanced analysis.</p>\n<p>Every few years, manmade spills focus attention on environmental issues surrounding oil extraction and draw public concern about the fate of spilled oil and how quickly it can dissipate so that impacted ecosystems can recover.&nbsp; Scientists have frequently used past spills as uncontrolled experiments to study the processes by which oil &ldquo;weathers,&rdquo; a general term encompassing various transformations of oil by environmental and biological forces.&nbsp; Through such work, in part, it has been found that a substantial portion of the tar-like material that persists years after a spill appears to be produced by photochemical reactions initiated by sunlight.&nbsp; These cause the oil to incorporate oxygen into its structure, becoming partially oxidized, not to carbon monoxide or dioxide, but instead to a water-insoluble polymer that physically resembles asphalt-like tar.&nbsp; Recent research refers to these partially oxidized hydrocarbons as OxyHC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We examined the formation rates of OxyHC in marine oil slicks.&nbsp; The focus on marine systems was driven by several factors.&nbsp; For one, much of the world&rsquo;s petroleum reserves, including most U.S. reserves, are located off-shore, and spills during marine extraction produce residual OxyHC that can severely impact coastal ecosystems. &nbsp;Improved understanding of OxyHC chemistry could enhance spill response efficiency; for example, responders don&rsquo;t currently factor in OxyHC formation when deciding the timing and amounts of dispersant application, yet OxyHC is not susceptible to control by dispersants.&nbsp; We also focused on marine systems because a substantial amount of oil, equal to or, in some estimates, exceeding that of accidental releases, enters the ocean via natural seeps (albeit at substantially slower rates than accidental releases); the environmental fate of natural seep oil is not well-constrained, and as such represents a gap in current understanding of this portion of the carbon cycle. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lab studies reproducibly formed OxyHC by irradiating crude oil slicks on water with simulated sunlight (Figure 1).&nbsp; These reactions occurred very quickly, requiring only a few days to convert 20% to 30% of the oil to OxyHC.&nbsp; The lab experiments involved fairly thick oil films, more characteristic of spill conditions than the thin films encountered near natural seeps.&nbsp; Extrapolating lab conditions to what might be expected from thin films suggested that just one day of sunlight exposure during summer in the Gulf of Mexico could produce comparable chemical changes.&nbsp; During field research, we followed a natural seep slick in the Gulf over the course of a day, and we observed more rapid production of OxyHC than the lab studies predicted, suggesting that partially weathered seep oil may be more susceptible to partial oxidation than unweathered well-head oil (Figure 2).&nbsp; Follow up lab studies measured the exact efficiency for conversion of solar energy to oxygen uptake.&nbsp; This quantity is a key parameter for modeling the photochemical formation rate of OxyHC in the environment, and as a case study, we chose to retrospectively model OxyHC formation during the Deep Water Horizon (DWH) disaster of 2010.</p>\n<p>By combining chemical analyses and fluid dynamics modeling, we showed that the best predictor of OxyHC formation in the spilled oil was the time that the oil spent floating on the ocean surface (Figure 3); due to currents and wind, this is not well-correlated to distance from the well.&nbsp; Figure 3 also shows that photochemical formation of OxyHC is extremely rapid and can be expected in the first few days of a spill subjected to sunlight.&nbsp; Next, we used lab measurements of the photochemical efficiency along with measurements of the sunlight intensity in the Gulf during the DWH spill to predict the daily rate of oxygen consumption by oil as a function of wavelength.&nbsp; Figure 4 shows the calculated results for May 31, 2010 and demonstrates that comparable amounts of the chemistry are driven by ultraviolet and visible light.&nbsp; A comprehensive model of oil oxidation over the course of the spill gave results for oxygen uptake that agreed well with estimates from field samples.&nbsp; Furthermore, the model suggests that photochemical formation of OxyHC was the fate for a significant fraction of the spilled oil: we estimate that the amount of oil partially oxidized to OxyHC on the Gulf surface was at least 25% as big as the amount of hydrocarbons degraded by microbes in the deep sea oil plume.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sharpless</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333026/1333026_10259258_1514650663903_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333026/1333026_10259258_1514650663903_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1333026/1333026_10259258_1514650663903_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Natural slick sampling in the Gulf of Mexico.
