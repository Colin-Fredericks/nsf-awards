 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum is very successful in the vascular tissue of its plant hosts even though this habitat contains few nutrients and little oxygen.  This project's central hypothesis is that R. solanacearum uses inorganic nitrogen, one of the few abundant nutrients in plant sap, not just for food but also to generate energy and to sense and manipulate plant defenses. The investigators will use genetic and biochemical experiments to identify the specific adaptations that allow this pathogen to use inorganic nitrogen in multiple ways as it causes plant disease. Expected results include a better understanding of how R. solanacearum grows at low oxygen levels and a definition of the role(s) in virulence of nitric oxide, a common biological signal molecule that also has antimicrobial properties. R. solanacearum is a widely distributed pathogen with many hosts, so these results are likely to be relevant to diverse plant-associated microbes. Plant vascular systems are home to many microbes, ranging from destructive pathogens like R. solanacearum to valuable mutualists that can increase plant stress tolerance or growth.\r\n\r\nThis project will generate basic biological knowledge about the biochemical mechanisms used by plant-inhabiting microbes. In addition, this project will contribute to the nation's scientific workforce by training a postdoctoral researcher and a doctoral student in laboratory research, teaching and mentoring, which are all key skills for future faculty. Three undergraduate students will also receive independent research experiences in microbiology.",

The disease, which is caused by the soilborne bacterium <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em>, is difficult to control and has major socioeconomic impacts on a global scale. <em>R. solanacearum</em> colonizes the water-transporting xylem vessels of host plants. Although xylem sap is considered nutrient-poor, the pathogen multiplies rapidly in this environment, ultimately reaching population sizes of over 1 billion bacteria per gram of stem. The bacteria and their products block water transport, causing plants to wilt and die (Figure 1). To understand how <em>R. solanacearum</em> succeeds in this unpromising environment, we identified the metabolic processes used by the bacterium during tomato pathogenesis.&nbsp; Several biochemical pathways involving nitrogen were very highly expressed when <em>R. solanacearum </em>grew in tomato plants. We found that tomato xylem sap contains a significant amount of nitrogen in the form of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>).</p>\n<p>The goal of this project was to determine how this active nitrogen metabolism helps <em>R. solanacearum</em> kill plants. &nbsp;We identified three distinct types of nitrogen metabolism that play important roles in bacterial wilt disease. First, <em>R. solanacearum</em> extracts the essential nutrient nitrogen from nitrate and uses it to make proteins, DNA, RNA, and other cellular components. Mutant bacteria lacking the ability to assimilate nitrogen were significantly reduced in virulence on tomato, indicating that this trait helps <em>R. solanacearum</em> infect plants.</p>\n<p>Second, <em>R. solanacearum</em> uses nitrate to make energy in a process known as denitrifying respiration. The bacterium prefers to use oxygen to respire, as humans do, but when oxygen is limiting, <em>R. solanacearum</em> can respire by substituting nitrogen for oxygen. Direct measurements with a micro-probe detected very little oxygen inside xylem vessels of wilting plants. We constructed a set of <em>R. solanacearum</em> mutants lacking each of the five steps by which nitrate is converted to inert nitrogen gas (Fig 2A). The more of the pathway that was missing from a mutant, the less able it was to colonize tomato stems or cause disease, demonstrating that denitrifying respiration contributes to <em>R. solanacearum&rsquo;s</em> success as a pathogen (Fig 2B).</p>\n<p>Third, bacterial denitrifying respiration releases a highly reactive molecule, nitric oxide (NO), which is both a toxin and a common signaling molecule. We noticed that <em>R. solanacearum</em> mutants that overproduce NO also trigger an abnormally strong plant defense. Mutants that cannot make NO are less able to trigger this defense. We hypothesize that <em>R. solanacearum</em> uses NO to activate the molecular syringe it uses to inject virulence proteins into plant cells thereby increasing disease and also triggering plant defenses. This sort of NO-mediated activation is rare in bacteria.
