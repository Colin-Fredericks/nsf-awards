 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the computing industry steps into the many-core regime, the main memory system has\r\nbecome one of the key bottlenecks that limits both performance and scalability. To address these\r\nchallenges, the memory industry is developing 3D-stacked DRAM technology. Die stacking can\r\nprovide lower latency, much higher bandwidth, and significantly reduced energy dissipation.\r\nUnfortunately, stacked memory is unlikely to have sufficient capacity to completely replace\r\ntraditional DRAM. Therefore, future memory systems will likely use stacked memory in\r\ncombination with off-chip DRAM, either architecting stacked DRAM as a giga-scale cache or as\r\nheterogeneous main memory. However, to fully utilize the potential of stacked memory, the\r\nsystem architecture must make choices that exploit the unique latency and bandwidth\r\ncharacteristics offered by stacked DRAM. For example, simply applying traditional \"well-understood\"\r\ncache designs and memory designs to stacked DRAM results in low performance\r\nand poor bandwidth utilization.\r\n\r\nThis project first looks at caching organizations and management strategies for stacked DRAM\r\nthat are tailored to exploit latency and bandwidth properties of 3D stacking. It then looks at\r\nmemory organizations that can incorporate stacked memory as part of memory address space,\r\nwithout relying on OS support to exploit temporal locality and still perform memory\r\nmanagement at fine granularity. Finally, this project investigates morphable architectures that can\r\ndynamically reconfigure the stacked DRAM between cache structure and main memory, in order\r\nto conserve power and optimize performance depending on the workload requirements. The\r\nresearch solutions in this study will thus help future systems obtain an order of magnitude\r\nimprovement in both bandwidth and energy-efficiency from the effective use of memory\r\nstacking.",
