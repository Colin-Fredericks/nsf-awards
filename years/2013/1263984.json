 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop brings together US and non-US representatives of the marine geology and geophysics community, as well as the offshore hydrocarbon industry to discuss shared data challenges in the marine geophysics area, in particular issues surrounding the collection, processing, and availability of 3D seismic data. Workshop Goals are to review successful examples of academic and industry shared-use activities in marine geophysics and discuss lessons learned, to discuss the possibility of R/V Marcus Langseth (the NSF-owned 3D seismic research vessel) operations that could both benefit the academic and industrial sector, and to discuss a possible joint industry-academic data acquisition and data interpretation scenario. Data discovery and accessibility issues and cyberinfrastructure needs related to EarthCube, the new NSF activity to integrate and improve the computing and data management needs of the NSF Geosciences Directorate, will also be discussed and summarized in documents to be made available to the public. This meeting is designed to address problems that have a significant present and future influence on the marine geophysicsl research and the education of the next generation of marine geophysicists.  It will also explore improved sustainability of the Langseth 3-D seismic platform.",
