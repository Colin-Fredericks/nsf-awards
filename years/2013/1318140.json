Arid regions west of the 105th Meridian produce less runoff compared to humid regions in the East that produce greater than 40 cm of mean annual runoff. Consequently, reservoirs in the West are over-year systems holding multiple years of inflows, whereas reservoirs in the East are within-year storage systems with the need to refill the system in the beginning of spring. Accordingly, water policies also differ substantially with western states pursuing (\"prior appropriation\") and the eastern states following (\"riparian rights\") for allocation. These contrasting strategies also impact freshwater biodiversity with the ratio of non-native to native fish species being nearly 6 times higher in the West compared to the East. In spite of these cross-regional differences, both regions face two common stressors: (a) uncertainty in available freshwater arising from global climate change and (b) increased human demand due to population growth and consumption. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing need for an integrated assessment of freshwater sustainability under these two stressors over the planning horizon (10-30 years). The main objective of this study is to understand and quantify the potential impacts of near-term climate change and population growth on freshwater sustainability - defined here as integrating daily to annual flows required to minimize human vulnerability and maximize ecosystem needs (including native biodiversity) for freshwater - by explicitly incorporating the feedbacks from human-environmental systems on water supply and demand in various target basins spanning Arizona to North Carolina. Using retro-analyses involving AR5 multimodel climate change hindcasts, we will revisit how freshwater sustainability could have been better achieved over the past five decades across the Sunbelt. To couple the hydroclimatic and hydro-ecological system dynamics with the management of freshwater infrastructure systems, a two-level agent-based modeling framework will explicitly simulate adaptive behaviors and feedbacks between policy and consumers. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project will involve collaboration among three universities, North Carolina State University (NCSU), Arizona State University (ASU), and University of Georgia (UGA). Findings from the AR5 retro-analyses will evaluate and recommend societal options (i.e., supply augmentation vs. demand reduction) for promoting future (2015-2034) freshwater sustainability across the Sunbelt. Cross-regional synthesis of policies and media sources for the targeted basins will identify de-centralized adaptive strategies that have been employed independently and collectively to maintain flows, increase supplies, or reduce demands. Utilizing the near-term hydroclimatic projections, PIs will quantify how current policies on reservoir operations and groundwater extraction could impact the reliability of future water supplies for cities and also alter the key attributes of hydrographs that are critical for maintaining freshwater biodiversity. In doing so, the project will also investigate the degree to which regions have pursued \"hard path\" (i.e., supply augmentation) vs. \"soft path\" (i.e., demand reduction) strategies by explicitly modeling potential societal interventions for freshwater sustainability. The educational goal of the project is to conduct an online distributed seminar in which Honors, MS and PhD students from three Universities with interdisciplinary backgrounds will produce a policy-oriented white paper based on the key findings. Based on the white paper, the project team will distribute a suite of podcasts on freshwater sustainability and climate change to middle and high school science programs from the targeted basin states as well as to key water policy institutions across the region. Podcasts, developed data, tools and publications will also be disseminated through the main project portal at NCSU, and additionally through the National Climate Assessment and ASU's Central Arizona - Phoenix LTER websites.",

A national-scale synthesis of public supply withdrawals reveals a strong North&ndash;South gradient in public supply water use with the increasing population in the South contributing to increased withdrawal. Contrastingly, a reverse South&ndash;North gradient exists in per capita withdrawals (&ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;), with northern states consistently improving the efficiency, while the southern states&rsquo; efficiency declined. Urban counties exhibit improved efficiency over rural counties. Improved efficiency is also demonstrated over high-income and well-educated counties. Given the potential implications of the findings in developing long-term water conservation measures, more frequent updates of water-use data are needed to identify effective strategies that enhance water-use efficiency in various geographic settings under a changing climate.&nbsp; With enhanced human water-use efficiency, we can be more effective at conservation of imperiled freshwater biodiversity. Dams and climate change alter hydrologic patterns in rivers and drive many freshwater species to extinction. We investigated how dams and hydrologic alterations interact with species ecological and life history traits to influence past extirpation probabilities of native freshwater fishes in rivers of the American Southwest (Upper and Lower Colorado River) and Southeast (Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint). Using long-term discharge data for continuously gaged streams and rivers, we quantified streamflow anomalies (i.e., departure &lsquo;expected&rsquo; streamflow) at the sub-basin scale over the past half-century. Next, we related extirpation probabilities of native fishes in both regions to streamflow anomalies, river basin characteristics, species traits, and nonnative species richness using binomial logistic regression. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southwest&nbsp;were highest in lowland mainstem rivers impacted by large dams and in desert springs. Dampened flow seasonality, increased longevity (i.e., delayed reproduction), and decreased fish egg sizes (i.e., lower parental care) were related to elevated fish extirpation probability in the Southwest. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southeast were most prevalent in upland rivers, with flow-dependency, greater age and length at maturity, isolation by dams, and greater distance upstream. Our results confirm that dams are an overriding driver of native fish species losses, irrespective of basin-wide differences in native or nonnative species richness. Dams and hydrologic alterations interact with species traits to influence community disassembly, and very high extirpation risks in the Southeast are due to interactions between high dam density and species restricted ranges. Given global surges in dam&nbsp;building and retrofitting, increased extirpation risks should be expected unless management strategies that balance flow regulation with ecological outcomes are widely implemented.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Kominoski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116579826_water--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116579826_water--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rural and Urban Water Withdrawals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116579826_water--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rural and Urban Water Withdrawals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Change in per-capita withdrawals, computed as the difference between 2010 and 1985 estimates, for urban (blue to red) and rural (green to yellow) counties based on the 2013 USDA classification.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AGU Publications</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Kominoski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rural and Urban Water Withdrawals</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509115670514_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509115670514_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sunbelt\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509115670514_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sunbelt\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of the study river basins in the Southwest (Upper and Lower Colorado River) and Southeast U.S. (Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River basin, left; Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin, right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wiley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Kominoski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sunbelt</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116834739_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116834739_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fish Diversity and Sub-Basin Extirpations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318140/1318140_10204204_1509116834739_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fish Diversity and Sub-Basin Extirpations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Species richness of native freshwater fishes within individual sub-basins of the (a) Upper and Lower Colorado River (CR), and (b) Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola Chattahoochee-Flint River basins.
