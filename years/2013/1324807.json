 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education DIP (Development and Implementation) Project, the PIs focus on how to address the English-language learning needs of young English-language learners (ELLs).  They are enhancing the Moved by Reading (MbR) computer program that has been used to increase the reading comprehension of native English speakers. In MbR, a child actively simulates a sentence or a set of sentences being read by moving pictures on a computer screen to illustrate what he or she understands. When they become competent at that, learners transition to imagining moving pictures as they are reading so that they become independent and accomplished readers. In this project, the PIs are enhancing MbR in several ways to help ELLs learn English and learn to read in English. The new approach, called EMBRACE (Enhanced Moved by Reading to Accelerate Comprehension in English), includes MbR as well as facilities for vocabulary support in learners' first language (in this case, Spanish), personalizing choice of next texts to read based on learners' syntax and vocabulary capabilities and needs, game-like facilities for sustaining engagement, and support for collaboration. Research is addressing the roles and effects of each of these supports for learning so as to identify good practices for promoting English-language literacy in ELLs, how to use technology to support those practices, and trajectories of development of English-language competencies in such learners.\r\n\r\nBecause reading serves as a gateway to academic success, graduation, and employment, there is a great national need to address the English-language learning and reading needs of those whose first language is something other than English. This project addresses this issue through the development of an approach called EMBRACE -- Enhanced Moved by Reading to Accelerate Comprehension in English, an interactive software system to be used in elementary school classrooms, supplementary programs, and at home. Using EMBRACE, children learn English vocabulary, syntax, and reading through manipulating pictures representing the content of what they are reading. Choice of next texts to read is personalized to individual learners. Learners also are supported in working on language issues with peers.",

When they read a sentence printed in blue font, the child engages in one of two activities. In the physical manipulation (PM) stage, the child moves the pictures to physically simulate the meaning of the sentence.&nbsp; For example, after reading ?The cow walks to the corral,? the child uses her finger to literally move the image of the cow to the corral. Thus, the child uses her perceptual system to map words to images, and she uses her motor system to simulate the syntax, that is, the who does what to whom. In the imagine manipulation stage (IM), upon reading a sentence in blue font the child imagines moving the images.</p>\n<p>EMBRACE incorporates several other features to additionally help ELL children. Spanish support helps the child by having a) key vocabulary words defined in both Spanish and English before each chapter, b) the iPad pronounce the word in English and Spanish (without definition) whenever the child taps on the word, and c) the iPad read aloud the first chapter of each multi-chapter text in Spanish to introduce the child to many of the important themes in the child?s native language.&nbsp; The intelligent tutoring system (ITS) further supports reading by providing the child with immediate feedback on their manipulation (i.e., is it right or wrong?). The ITS also adjusts features depending on the child?s reading performance.&nbsp; If a child moves the wrong image (in PM), then that item is added to the pre-chapter vocabulary list. If the child moves the correct images but is otherwise incorrect, then the syntax of the sentence is simplified.</p>\n<p><strong>The intellectual merit</strong> of the project was conceived as three research questions.&nbsp; First, will EMBRACE help Latino ELLs comprehend better than when reading on an iPad with non-moveable text and pictures? We report those improvements in published research.&nbsp; We found that the improvements were mainly for narrative (story-like) texts. For expository (informational texts), EMBRACE mainly helped children who were good decoders, that is, good at pronouncing written words.&nbsp; We also found that Spanish support helped when children were deficient either in decoding or in English competency. Second, will the ITS improve comprehension? We were able to design and build a simulation-based ITS for early reading comprehension, and that had never been done before. Although we did find some positive benefits (e.g., children with the poorest comprehension tended to use features like tapping on a word to hear the pronunciation), we did not find overall improvement due to the ITS.&nbsp; Third, will dyadic collaboration using EMBRACE improve comprehension?&nbsp; We had originally conceived dyadic cooperation as two children reading together, but decided that it would be more valuable to consider a child reading with a parent. We collected pilot data which indicated that parents found EMBRACE a) to be very valuable, b) improved the children?s motivation to read, and c) improved their skill at reading.</p>\n<p><strong>The broader impact</strong> can be measured at several levels.&nbsp; First, a total of 14 undergraduates participated in the research through the Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement.&nbsp; The majority of these students were underrepresented minorities. In addition, seven graduate students were supported at some point during their careers. Second, we had an impact on literally hundreds of Latino ELL children who participated in the studies.
