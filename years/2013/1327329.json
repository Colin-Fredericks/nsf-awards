 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports three meetings of the Lehigh-Harvard Conference on Geometry and Topology with the first one taking place at Lehigh University on May 24-26. The conference is held at Lehigh University two years out of three, and at Harvard University every third year. \r\n\r\nThe conference brings leading researchers of national and international stature in geometry and topology to discuss their latest work. The conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from the region and around the country to learn the most recent developments, to meet with each other and to share mathematics. The conference is also dedicated to the development and training of of graduate students and young faculty in geometry and topology. An important component of the conference is to attract and help graduate students and recent Ph.Ds to come from all over the country to learn and interact with principal speakers and other senior mathematicians; there are also ample chance for them to present their research results when the conference is held at Lehigh. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged.",
