 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual IEEE International Symposium on Safety Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR),\r\nsponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, International Rescue System Institute,\r\nand the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue, has a tradition of attracting cutting-edge\r\npapers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure inspection of critical\r\ninfrastructure, disaster response and recovery, disaster mitigation and recovery, detection of\r\nchemical, biological and radiological risks, and operations in these dangerous sites.\r\n\r\nIn the past it has served as a forum gathering international researchers together for the\r\nexchange of ideas on technical problems and their solutions in these domains. The 10th\r\nanniversary SSRR 2012 will be hosted this year at Texas A&M, College Station, Texas, while the\r\n11th will be hosted in Linkoping, Sweden. This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to assist\r\nstudents to participate in SSRR 2012 & 2013 to participate in field trials with actual responders.\r\nThis represents both the intellectgual merit and the broader impacts.",
