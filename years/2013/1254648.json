 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n1254648\r\nQiao, Li\r\n\r\nThe proposed study is focused on ignition and combustion of hydrogen and oxygen in nano-sized confinements formed by water nano-bubbles, which are generated by electrolysis.  It is hypothesized that ignition and combustion results from either (1) the confinement shortening the effective mean free path resulting in higher rates of molecular collision, reaction, and heat release to overcome the significant heat loss commonly encountered in small combustion devices, or (2) the pressure increase during the collapse of the water bubble resembling that in a rapid compression machine that leads to ignition and combustion of the reactant mixture.  Experimental efforts concentrate on measurements of bubble size, growth dynamics, and temperature within the bubble.  Scanning laser-Doppler vibrometry is used for determining bubble size and evolution, while micro fabrication techniques are used to produce nano-scale thermometer suitable for the associated small time and spatial length scales.  The study is aimed at bridging the gap between nano-science and traditional combustion science that are usually associated with systems of much larger scales such as engines.  Potential benefits include understanding ignition and combustion at truly nano-scales, with applications in small energy systems and machinery and fire safety.  A Molecular Dynamics approach is adopted for determining the pressure and chemical reactions of the H2/O2 mixture within the nano-bubble To help alleviate the difficulties in the proposed small-scale experiments.  The educational program calls for education of the public, dissemination of research through a popular nano-science website, research opportunities for undergraduate students, and recruitment and mentoring of woman engineering graduate students.",
