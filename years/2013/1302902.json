 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nLong lived greenhouse gas (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O, some CFCs) emissions play a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate. Urban environments increasingly lie at the core of many major environmental issues including climate change. Much of the human induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted globally originate in or nearby cities. How do you measure the carbon balance of a mega-city?  Society must be able to understand and predict the distribution of emitted GHGs within the urban atmosphere in order to assess the validity of emissions inventories, and the efficacy of any emission reduction programs.  Uncertainties in self-reported 'bottom up' GHG  emission inventories, derived from activity use data and generalized conversion factors, are often larger than emission reduction goals [IPCC, 2006; NRC, 2010]. This shortcoming can potentially be addressed by top-down (inverse) modeling that uses GHG measurements in the atmosphere, coupled with transport modeling and a priori flux constraints, to quantify source emissions.\r\n\r\nThis project, centered on observation and modeling of carbon fluxes in the Boston urban dome, has potentially broad impact, including: 1) use and refinement of the WRF-STILT model (which couples a research weather forecasting model with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model) to connect atmospheric (observation) with surface fluxes in large cities; 2) Regional and potentially worldwide applications of the model to verify regulatory, cap and trade and even global treaty needs;  3) Education of students and the public. Project data, results, and software will continue to be made publicly available during the proposed research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions play a critical role in regulating the Earth?s climate and according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) increases in the abundances of atmospheric GHGs since the industrial revolution are largely responsible for the observed warming of global averaged temperatures.  Drastically reducing GHG emissions is critical for minimizing global warming and its associated environmental, economic and societal impacts and many nations have committed to this task in recent international agreements.  For these international agreements to be effective, comprehensive monitoring and verification of emission reductions are required. However, the uncertainties in self-reported \"bottom up\" emission inventories, derived from activity data and generalized conversion factors, are often larger than emission reduction goals. This shortcoming can potentially be addressed by \"top-down\" or \"inverse\" modeling that uses GHG measurements in the atmosphere, coupled with transport modeling and existing emissions inventories, to produce more accurate emissions estimates.  \n\nFor this study a well-established program to measure carbon dioxide and methane headed by Harvard University (HU) and Boston University (BU) was utilized along with the top-down approach to improve GHG emission estimates from strong localized sources in Boston.  Such urban emissions constitute a substantial fraction of the US?s contribution to global abundances of GHGs.  The top-down approach employed for this study involved running the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model backward in time from the measurement locations at many different times to determine the geographic locations and relative strengths of the emissions sources contributing to the measured GHG concentrations.  To be reliable, STILT requires highly accurate meteorological input data that were provided in this study by the advanced research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  Our previous studies indicated that a principal limitation of this inverse modeling approach was the inability of the meteorological model to accurately represent the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the associated fine-scale circulation features near the ground.  The PBL is the layer of air closest to the ground that grows in depth and becomes turbulent as the ground warms during the day and then collapses again after nightfall.  The height of the PBL (PBLH) is a key parameter for top-down emissions estimates, as it determines the depth to which emissions are mixed and is inversely proportional to the resulting GHG concentrations measured.  For this reason, the accuracy of the WRF simulation of the PBL and how it is affected by various model options and surface inputs was a key focus of this study.  The WRF PBLH simulations were evaluated using PBLH estimates derived from measurements of aerosol distributions from a highly portable, or \"Mini\", micro-pulse lidar (MiniMPL) deployed on the roof of a building at BU.  The WRF simulations of the PBLH were evaluated for a 19-month period from June of 2013 to December of 2014.\n\nA key finding of our WRF PBLH evaluation was that the WRF simulations could be improved by incorporating a database that accurately represented the unique characteristics of the Boston urban landscape, including data on building heights and configurations.  Overall the model PBLHs were well correlated with the estimates derived from the MiniMPL data with an average overestimate of ~10 % in winter, spring and summer, and an average underestimate of ~ 5 % in the fall.  Generally, the model PBLH errors were less than 25 % but were better during the morning growth period and worse during the late afternoon and early evening collapse period.  Another finding was that the frequent occurrence of sea breezes in Boston impacted the comparisons as these transport cooler marine air onshore and cause a premature collapse of the PBL that is not always well simulated by WRF and can complicate the estimation of the PBLH from the MiniMPL measurements.\n\nAnother major outcome of this study is the discovery of a significant underestimation of the methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure in the Boston area.   This discovery was made using model simulations that were generated and evaluated with support from this project.  These results, which have implications for other urban areas in the US and globally, are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in an article titled \"Methane Emissions from natural gas infrastructure and use in the urban region of Boston, Massachusetts\" authored by Ph. D. student Kathryn McKain at HU.  The article was cited by major news outlets.\n\nAn examination of all the STILT outputs from this project indicated that the major anthropogenic contributions to the GHG concentrations measured with the Boston area were from sources within approximately 90 km of the city.  However, under certain circumstances emissions from distant sources could significantly contribute to the concentrations of GHGs and other substances that affect local air quality.  This finding has motivated a follow-on study of interstate pollution transport at Harvard University.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer D Hegarty"
