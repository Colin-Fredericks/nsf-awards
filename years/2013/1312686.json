This will be accomplished by studying intrinsic absorption line systems through their variability and through comparison of photoionization and hydrodynamic model predictions of absorption features with the data.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergrad and graduate students, and outreach to the local community via the established yearly Astrofest, a four night festival of astronomy attracting over 1500 members of the general public each summer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuasars    are massive black holes at the centers of galaxies that produce tremendous radiation as the accrete material from the surrounding galaxy.  In addition to the inflow of fuel, quasars expell a significant amount of gas in the form of a wind.  This project surveyed the spectra of many quasars in order to map their central engines, and to facilitate study of the physical conditions in the outflowing wind and its influence on the host galaxy.  Over 40% of quasars have absorbing gas detected, which signifies either that 40% of the solid angle around a quasar is covered by accretion disk wind gas, or that a larger fraction of quasars are even more surrounded.  The types of absorbing clouds seen in quasar spectra can be characterized as narrow (NAL) or broad (BAL), depending on the velocity range for the ejected gas, with an intermediate class known as mini-BALs.  Mini-BALs are seen to vary on a time-scale of months to years, while NALs are not seen to vary on a time-scale of years.  Through analysis of the variability of the mini-BALs their distances from the quasar central engine can sometimes be constrained to be quite close such that they must be part of the wind, while other times the material could be originating at larger distances in the host galaxy. Based on analysis of the different ionization stages of chemical transitions in the absorbing gas, an ionization sequence of absorbers has been found.  This can be explained in the context of parcels of gas that move with the wind, and rotate around the central engine, and others that are swept up from the interstellar medium of the host galaxy by the quasar wind.  In addition to the scientific results on the properties of quasar outflows, this project has funded an ambitious public outreach effort at Penn State.  The AstroFest program, offers four nights of stargazing, demonstrations, and presentations on astronomy for the general public each July.  The event attracts about 2000 visitors each year.  Recent programs have included some activities particularly motivated by this project, including a tie dye activity to make a quasar accretion disk wind, and presentations on supermassive black holes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane C Charlton"
