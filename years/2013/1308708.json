 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study several questions on harmonic maps between singular spaces. The main goal is to prove that, despite the singularities of the ambient spaces, harmonic maps have sufficient regularity so that geometric rigidity holds. Several applications to geometric group theory, character varieties, measured foliations and Teichmueller theory are being proposed. These questions are a continuation of the PI's work on geometric superrigidity via harmonic maps.\r\n\r\nMost objects in nature are non-smooth, in other words they have singularities. Mathematics is primarily designed to deal with smooth objects, for example something like the surface of the plane or the sphere or more generally objects without corners or complicated edges. In this project, the PI proposes the study of calculus on singular spaces and in particular the study of maps between such spaces that are optimal in the sense of minimizing energy. From this, he can deduce properties of symmetries of such spaces (groups) that are of interest in mathematics and applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA natural notion of energy for a map between geometric  spaces  is defined by  measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating.    Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional.  They can be seen  both as generalizations of harmonic functions in complex analysis and also as  higher dimensional analogues of parameterized geodesics in Riemannian geometry.   Next to  totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space  into another. The  work of Eells-Sampson  in the 60's launched an explosion of research for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.  Many important applications were found, particularly in minimal surface theory with applications to three dimensional topology and geometric superrigidity with applications to  group theory.A more recent development is the harmonic map theory for non-smooth spaces.  The seminal work of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen  studies energy minimizing maps in   the case when the target is an NPC space (i.e. a complete metric space withnon-negative curvature   in the sense of Alexandrov).\n\nMy work is on several problems in  harmonic map theory for singular geometry and applications to other fields, in particular Teichmueller theory and geometric group theory. A crucial problem is to understand regularity and singularity of harmonic maps in this setting.  Natural  questions that arise are:  Under what conditions is a harmonic map regular?  If not, what is the Hausdorff dimension of its singular set?  Is the singular  set  rectifiable? My work has answered these questions in the case of Hyperbolic Buildings and Teichmueller space and proved the holomorphic rigidity conjecture of Teichmueller space. The long-term goal  is to develop a general theory of harmonic maps in the absence of any smooth structure (i.e for general metric spaces) and explore further connections with  Teichmuller theory, Higgs Bundles and Geometric Topology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Georgios D Daskalopoulos"
