 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time captioning provides a text equivalent to aural speech within 5 seconds, providing (i) access to live events for deaf and hard of hearing people (e.g. mainstream lectures), (ii) an immediate transcript in the courtroom, and (iii) federally mandated access to live television programs. Currently, the only reliable solution is to engage professional stenographers. This project investigates the use of a technology and associated algorithm to provide real-time captioning. It enables 3-5 non-expert individuals to match the performance of an expert stenographer. Due to the technology's ability to provide users with a combination of a lower price point and a more elastic work force, it may allow people to use real-time captioning in ways they previously could not, e.g. to caption surreptitious events on-demand in their lives for only as long as necessary. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research can improve education for deaf and hard of hearing students by enabling access to serendipitous opportunities, such as conversations after class or last-minute guest lectures for which no interpreter or captionist was arranged. Real-time captioning may also be used in other settings as well, e.g. political events, school programs, artistic performances, and provide organizations with a much more cost effective means of providing high-quality captions for live events. Older hard of hearing adults usually prefer captioning, and represent a sizable and growing population. Hearing people may benefit because captioning is a first step in automatic translation of aural speech. Furthermore, because Scribe allows captionists to be selected primarily based on domain expertise instead of typing ability, more accurate captions can be collected in technical domains with complex jargon, potentially helping to reduce the underrepresentation of deaf and hard of hearing students in STEM fields.",
