 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle Dispersion in Plant Canopies is an innovative and comprehensive project designed to integrate research and education at the university level and to extend the learning to outreach at local area high schools in Salt Lake City.  It is designed to peak student interest in scientific research while they participate in lab activities focused on key hypotheses regarding atmospheric transport of particles through and above plant canopies with applications to atmospheric scalar transport and plant pathology in agricultural and natural ecosystems.  The project is well founded in learning theory and integrates the disciplines of meteorology, biology, physics, engineering and mathematics. It is part of the long-range career plan of the PI, is aligned with the University's mission, and meets College and Departmental goals.\r\n\r\nParticle transport through the atmosphere plays an important role in many ecosystems. Significant portions of these ecosystems interface with the atmosphere through plant canopies.  Understanding the transport through these canopies, between canopies and the overlying atmosphere, and between disconnected canopies is critical to understanding how these ecosystems function, and how to manage any positive or negative effects. The research objectives of the project are designed to investigate these issues and are critical towards developing improved models for net ecosystem fluxes and to prevent the spread of airborne pathogens that cause plant diseases.\r\n\r\nThe educational objectives address the NSF priority of encouraging more women and minorities to enroll in academic courses preparatory to STEM-related careers.  An extensive evaluation plan is included that will track participating students' attitude toward STEM careers in high school and follow course enrollment in STEM courses for three years.  Likewise, student tracking will occur at the undergraduate level, as enrollment data is available from each of the Utah high schools that feed into the University of Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project comes from the use of different approaches to develop a new comprehensive understanding of the impact of canopy geometry on flow dynamics and particle transport across a wide range of spatial scales.  This understanding will lead to new models that can account for momentum transport and particle dispersion in and above plant canopies facilitating the asking and answering of questions related to how canopy geometry affects ecosystem functioning and services, how ecosystems are connected across landscapes, food production, the economic security of agricultural producers, and general heavy particle dispersion.  Existing models for the dispersion and deposition of heavy particles to and from plant canopies fail to include the effect of horizontal heterogeneity (e.g., non-vegetated space between plants and land-cover transitions) on flow dynamics. The PI's goal is to develop improved models that can capture the effect of horizontal heterogeneity over a wide range of spatial scales to benefit natural and agricultural systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThrough direct collaboration with biologists, this project will contain a strong interdisciplinary component giving graduate students unique experience working outside their core discipline and promoting interaction between engineering, atmospheric science and biology. These interdisciplinary benefits will extend to undergraduate students and to the high school level in Utah. The active (hands-on) laboratory experiences will be designed to promote teaching, training, and learning at all of these levels, and to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. While the goal is to engage the students, a critical component of this program will be the involvement and training of high school teachers and their effect upon STEM enrollment. Results of the project will be disseminated broadly through the project's web site and conference attendance at high school and college science education conferences. Society in general will benefit from research leading to better management of natural resources and crop production.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project, entitled \"CAREER: A Multiscale Study of Heavy Particle Transport in Sparse Canopies\" examined how the structure of a plant canopy impacts the movement of particles, heat, moisture, and winds within a plant canopy and the exchange of these quantities with the atmosphere above the canopy.  Factors including plant height, spacing between plants, types of leaves (e.g., broad leaf or needles), and the density of leaves were included as variables of interest.  Uniquely, this project focused on plant canopies that have strong horizontal and vertical spatial organization patterns common in agricultural systems (e.g., grape vineyards) using a combination of computer simulations, experiments in commercial vineyards, and model studies in a wind tunnel.\n\nScientific Merit:\n\nThe project published a total of 12 peer-reviewed scientific articles in highly respected journals over its five and a half year duration detailing the project's primary scientific advancements. We showed that canopy density and spatial heterogeneity have strong impacts on the transport of particles to and from the canopy, on the interception of solar energy, and on the spatial distribution of temperature in a plant canopy.  These findings are significant because they demonstrate that classical transport theories that assume canopies are horizontally homogeneous cannot be assumed to translate to organized sparse canopies.  Our field experiments resulted in one of the most extensive databases ever collected in the lowest part of the atmosphere (measured by spatial density of samplers and number of plumes) of heavy particle plumes from point source releases.  This includes plumes collected in multiple vineyards and a highly vegetated suburban area. The plume database and the extensive microclimate measurements that accompany them demonstrated the irregular nature of particle dispersion (spread by turbulent winds) in these canopies and the impact this can have on plant systems and the exchange of momentum and energy in the lowest part of the atmosphere.  Additionally, these datasets have been used to develop and validate new particle plume spread models and will continue to be used for this purpose in the future. \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nTransport in plant canopies plays an important role in many ecosystems of societal and economic importance. This project most directly addressed transport in trellised agricultural canopies such as grape vineyards and has a direct application to the transport of airborne plant pathogens that cause economically harmful plant diseases.  The translation of the fundamental knowledge created during this project to agriculture was started during the project through publication of a technical review article in a plant pathology journal and a popular press article in a grape vineyard trade magazine.   Additionally, during the project funding was secured from the USDA-NIFA-SCRI program to continue this important knowledge transfer by using models developed by this CAREER award to understand and track the spread of grape powdery mildew strains that exhibit fungicide resistance (https://framenetworks.wsu.edu).\n\nBesides direct broader impacts to agricultural productivity this project has also directly trained three Ph.D. students who all now work in academic or federal research positions and engaged multiple undergraduate students, secondary school students, and secondary school educators through various outreach programs and student projects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rob Stoll"
