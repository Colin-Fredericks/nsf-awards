 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.",

This project has helped us make significant inroads towards our goal, specifically in the neuro-rehab field of physical therapy, serving amputees, stroke survivors, and persons with Parkinson?s disease.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body-noindent-topspace\"><strong>Significant Outcomes of the Award:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body-noindent-topspace\">(1) This award in total has provided critical support to the research and development necessary to produce alpha and beta prototypes of instrumented insoles, alpha and beta prototypes of ?pod? sensors mounted to the top of the shoes, as well as establishing our cloud software, including HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system. We were able implement design reviews throughout this research and development. These design reviews have guided us to amend our proposed outcomes, influenced by the market needs. We incorproated physical therapists and patients into a design sprint that guided our initial launch, and more recently interviewed 11 professionals in the broader neuro-rehab community including skilled nursing facilities (inpatient), home healthcare physical therapists, assisted living facilities, and home care coordinators.</p>\n<p class=\"Body-noindent-topspace\">(2) A portion of the design reviews, interviews, and pilot testing in clinics was supported by our TECP supplement. This was significantly helpful. These led to (a) the transition from an instrumented insole inside the shoe to a sensor pod on top of the shoe (for ease of use with multiple patients in the clinic, and avoiding the need to stock a variety of sizes that would also need a cleaning protocol), and (b) moving directly to an at-home product for patients, rather than expecting the at-home product to follow a first product in the physical therapy clinic. Critically, we learned that although physical therapists universally tell us that they need better outcome measures in the clinic, the reality is that their finely honed skills (generally) provide the bulk of information they need to effectively treat their patients. However, even home health care physical therapists get only a glimpse of how their patients move at home ? and that glimpse occurs while the physical therapist is present.

Significantly, this foundation achieved through this award has allowed us to provide sensors and user accounts to a variety of locations to do a variety of pilots. This has been invaluable in terms of continuing to provide us with market feedback.</p>\n<p class=\"Body-noindent-topspace\">(4) Through our existing NSF-funded hardware and software, one of our pilots has led to a partnership with another small company (which also received NSF research grant as well as Phase I SBIR support).

This award has significantly helped us increase our ability to do so. Lack of mobility reduces independence, and ability or inability to move as desired are directly related to quality of life. We look forward to continuing to work to assist the 13.7% of adult Americans living with mobility disability (as defined by the CDC as serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs) have better tools at home to increase their independence and quality of life.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stacy&nbsp;Bamberg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1331108/1331108_10277246_1567598724516_veristride_pod-blue-on-shoe--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1331108/1331108_10277246_1567598724516_veristride_pod-blue-on-shoe--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Veristride PT Metrix Pod on Shoe\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1331108/1331108_10277246_1567598724516_veristride_pod-blue-on-shoe--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Veristride PT Metrix Pod on Shoe\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows the first generation Veristride PT Metrix \"sensor pod\" mounted on a shoe.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dzana Masic</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacy&nbsp;Bamberg</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Veristride PT Metrix Pod on Shoe</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1331108/1331108_10277246_1567598919924_veristride_pod-evolution-shoes_fullsize--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1331108/1331108_10277246_1567598919924_veristride_pod-evolution-shoes_fullsize--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Veristride &quot;Pod&quot;
