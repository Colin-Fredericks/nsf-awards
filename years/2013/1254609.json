 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Dean, Delphine \r\nProposal Number: 1254609 \r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to improve understanding of how mechanical variability at the nano- and micro-scale affects macroscale properties of tissues. In pursuit of this goal, this project seeks to use clustering and machine vision algorithms to build mechanical models of vascular smooth muscle cell constructs with tunable levels of geometric complexity. Validation of the models uses a combination of traditional soft tissue mechanical testing with novel methods that utilize ink-jet printing and concurrent probe and optical microscopy to assess dynamic structural and mechanical properties of cells living inside 3D-cultures. These tunable models can then be used to assess the level of structural detail that is required for accurate prediction of biomechanical behavior observed in specific sets of experimental conditions. \r\n\r\nThe long-term educational goal of this project is to increase South Carolina student and parent awareness of the applications and benefits of skills in engineering and computation and thereby, increase the number of students who choose engineering as a career. For this proposal, her educational objectives are: 1) to involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students directly in the research activities, 2) to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups in the PI's research lab, and 3) to develop new workshops and videos designed to increase SC student and parent enthusiasm for engineering careers by highlighting the broad societal impact of engineering and computation. Meeting these objectives will include leading an interdisciplinary \"Creative Inquiry\" team of undergraduates, who will develop workshops and video vignettes for South Carolina students. Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited to the team through established campus minority recruitment programs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This study addresses one of the grand challenges of biomedical research: how to create and assess in vitro cell cultures that accurately reflect in vivo cell responses. Success here will require overcoming numerous technical challenges in machine vision, experimental design, and mechanical modeling and in the fusion of these domains. To assess mechanical properties of cells inside 3D cultures in response to different stimuli, we will adapt a new and novel technique, band excitation atomic force microscopy (BE-AFM), for use in fluids with living cells. By overcoming several of the obstacles the field now faces in characterizing the biomechanics of 3D cell cultures, these studies will result in better characterization of the mechanical properties of vascular smooth muscle cells than has been accomplished to date. The novel methods proposed here are expected to advance the state of the art in modeling of biological tissues. The results can be used to assess the level of biological structural complexity that is required for accurate prediction of mechanical behavior, a necessary step for any multiscale cell-to-organ modeling strategy. By quantifying the effect of structural detail on living cell and tissue mechanical properties in 3D cultures, these studies will bridge the knowledge gap between actual cell and tissue structure and the simplified mechanics models currently used to describe them. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: As medicine shifts focus from macroscale treatments to molecular- and cellular-based therapies, this work will help guide future medical treatment by enabling researchers to better assess how these new types of therapies may influence large-scale tissue function. The BE-AFM and confocal microscopy technique that we will develop to assess the mechanical properties of cells inside thin 3D cultures will enable researchers in a broad range of fields to answer numerous questions beyond those tackled in this proposal. The research plan directly involves graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students. The planned outreach workshops, videos, and curriculum activities will help SC students and parents become more aware of the applications and benefits of skills in computation and engineering. The PI meets year-round with directors of campus programs that support recruitment and retention of minority students and women. Her commitment to providing research opportunities for these students is the foundation of her integrated research and education plan.",

While traditional cell experiments let researchers image and probe at very high resolution many properties of cells grown on 2D plastic petri dishes or glass coverslips, it has been very difficult to translate those results to what happens to cells inside a soft 3D tissue.

These use accessible techniques like ink-jet printing and acrylic stencils, which can be easily used by students with little prior training. The PI also helped to develop a new technique to directly measure individual cell mechanical properties both in under stretch and in compression simultaneously. Using these techniques, the PI and her team have shown that vascular smooth muscle cells vary their mechanical properties by an order of magnitude depending on their cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as well as small stressors like mechanical stretching or low-dose radiation. Vascular smooth muscle cells are the cells responsible for regulating blood pressure in blood vessels and such changes in cell mechanical properties could have large effects on the blood vessel properties.&nbsp; To help scale the small cell based results to tissues, the PI has developed computational tools to model these cell structure and function relationships with realistic geometries that are representative of the experimental conditions. One of the current bottlenecks for creating computational models with geometries that replicate experimental geometries is the time it takes to convert images manually. The PI?s techniques use new approaches to automatically generate cell shapes and internal structures that replicate the structures observed experimentally. These types of models generate reasonable data that are comparable to experimental measures. While these complicated geometric finite element models are well suited for studying complex biological responses, they are hard for students to access and understand. Thus, the PI and her students have created an easy to use electromechanical model for teaching called \"CellSpark\". This was used in an undergraduate bioinstrumentation course to allow students to design and run virtual experiments on neurons and cardiovascular cells that probed the effect of a variety of factors on the electrophysiological response of the cells.</p>\n<p>This project also enabled many educational, training and outreach initiatives and programs. The PI developed two different Creative Inquiry undergraduate research teams. These teams included 6-12 undergraduates every semester who worked directly on parts of the research project. In addition, the students and PI have developed numerous demonstrations, videos, and displays to teach the K-12 students about concepts in engineering and highlight STEM careers and outcomes to the general public. These demos have been used and highlighted at schools, in a science museum, and several large public events throughout the state of South Carolina. Through a partnership with a teacher of the Project Lead the Way programs at the Hamilton Career Center at the Oconee County Public School District in South Carolina, this project has also supported over 50 high school students to work on research projects with mentoring from faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students at Clemson University. These research experiences helped students gain a better understanding of the science process and helped to influence them to pursue STEM degrees post high school graduation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/08/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Delphine&nbsp;Dean</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1254609/1254609_10254776_1578501711427_ImageToModelCell--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1254609/1254609_10254776_1578501711427_ImageToModelCell--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Process of transforming cell microscope images to computational models\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1254609/1254609_10254776_1578501711427_ImageToModelCell--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Process of transforming cell microscope images to computational models\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image showing the process of converting a microscope image of a cell (left) automatically to a model geometry (right).
