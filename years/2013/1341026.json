 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes NSF support to enhance the networking capabilities at Kansas State University to support high-end applications in science and engineering, particularly bioinformatics, with applications in OpenFlow research and privacy/security.\r\n\r\nThe project adds a pair of high-performance, low-latency OpenFlow-compatible enterprise routers to provide a foundation for upgrading KSU's campus core network to 40GbE, and 10GbE to most major research buildings on campus. KSU is adding another router to set up a science DMZ for research in OpenFlow and Smart Grid research. This impacts over 24 departments in 16 locations, 8,000 undergrad majors, 2,000 grad students, 700 faculty, and $88M in funded research. This system, along with the expertise provided by related personnel, serves as a common hybrid network technology platform for a number of research groups in genomics, smart grids, GIS/environmental modeling and computer security at K-State and off-campus partners.\r\n\r\nThe project increases KSU's ability to look deeper in modeling genomes, Smart Grids, GIS economies and computer security through bringing much greater bandwidth and flexibility to bear, attacking grand challenges like forecasting responses of ecological systems to genetic changes. KSU expects to help protect the nation through developing better understanding of threats to key agricultural products, like the Hessian fly, which attacks wheat. KSU also plans to gain insight into advanced networking and its interaction with controlling the effects of brownouts or sabotage on the electrical grid; and significantly enhance and integrate  educational efforts at all levels for data-driven computing, particularly in bioinformatics.",
