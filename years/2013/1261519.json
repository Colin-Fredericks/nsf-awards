 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, led by a team of researchers at the University of California - Davis, seeks to provide fundamental understanding of the environmental and biological processes that control common geochemical proxies in planktonic foraminifera.  Specifically, the work will focus on improving and developing new calibrations for and understanding proxy behavior in two paleoceanographically important planktonic foraminifer species (the non-spinose N. dutertrei and N. pachyderma). These species inhabit subsurface waters and polar and subpolar latitudes, and are important in reconstructing past variations in stratification, thermocline depth, upwelling intensity, productivity, monsoon variability, ENSO dynamics, and high latitude processes. \r\n\r\nUsing high-resolution microanalytical techniques (laser-ICP-MS, electron microprobe, and NanoSIMS) together with stable isotope tracers and controlled foraminiferal culture experiments, the researchers will isolate the impacts of key processes that can affect the shell composition of planktonic foraminifera. The goal of these experiments is to use the mechanistic understanding gained to improve interpretations of paleoceanographic reconstructions of environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include improved calibrations of geochemical proxies widely used by the paleoceanography and paleoclimate communities. The researchers are actively involved in teaching and mentoring both graduate students and young scientists, and several are supported through this project.",

The shape of the thermocline (vertical change in temperature with depth) responds rapidly to changes in wind strength and direction, and is an indicator of wind stress. Researchers seeking to understand long-term changes in surface ocean circulation need tools to reconstruct changes in the thermocline structure over time. The chemistry of microscopic shells of planktonic foraminifera from the upper ocean provide a &ldquo;paleothermometer&rdquo; for reconstructing temperature in the past. Researchers use these paleothermometers to translate the chemistry of fossil specimens from deep-sea cores into records of past temperature. By comparing the temperature between species that lived at different depths in the water column, researchers can reconstruct thermocline changes over geologic time scales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the last three decades, the response of shell magnesium/calcium ratios (Mg/Ca) and stable oxygen isotope composition (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) in living foraminifera to temperature has been measured in laboratory experiments. These experiments have been fundamental in calibrating these geochemical properties as paleothermometers; however, they have also shown that the chemistry of different species responds differently to temperature.&shy;&shy;&shy; Thus far, laboratory experiments have focused almost exclusively on species that live above the thermocline. Very few have studied species that inhabit the thermocline, yet reconstructions of thermocline structure depend on our ability to pair temperature estimates from surface and thermocline dwellers. Accurate calibrations and better understanding of the habitat and ecology of thermocline dwellers are therefore essential for quantifying changes in upper ocean circulation, heat transport, and associated changes in productivity. These improved reconstructions will enable climate modelers to make better predictions regarding the effects of global warming on upwelling and other ocean circulation processes.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of this project was to develop laboratory calibration relationships for Mg/Ca and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O versus temperature and pH, with a particular focus on the thermocline-dwelling species <em>Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Neogloboquadrina incompta</em>, and <em>Neogloboquadrina pachyderma</em>. A second important goal was to explore how Mg, barium (Ba), and other metals are taken up by the shell calcite of these species. We raised living <em>N. dutertrei</em>, <em>N. incompta</em> and <em>N. pachyderma</em> at a range of temperature and pH levels until they completed their life cycle and produced empty shells (Figure 1). In these experiments we identified the shell calcite formed under laboratory-controlled conditions by adding the isotopes <sup>86</sup>Sr and<sup> 87</sup>Sr to the seawater in which the specimens grew. Calcite formed under culture conditions was then identified by its elevated <sup>86</sup>Sr/<sup>88</sup>Sr or <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>88</sup>Sr ratios compared to natural ratios, using high-resolution analytical techniques: laser ablation inductively-coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Our research shows that the Mg/Ca in calcite added during shell formation and growth (ontogenetic calcite) of <em>N. incompta</em> is much more sensitive to temperature than that in the &ldquo;crust&rdquo; added later in its life cycle. We therefore provided a temperature calibration for the ontogenetic calcite in this species and in <em>N. pachyderma</em> (Figure 3). Temperature reconstructions for the upper water column of ancient oceans can be improved by applying this calibration to fossil ontogenetic calcite. These experiments showed no significant effect of pH on Mg/Ca incorporation. We also generated the first culture-based &delta;<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;-temperature relationship for <em>N. dutertrei</em> and show that this species forms calcite in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with seawater (Figure 4). This result confirms previous research showing agreement between the depth habitat of <em>N. dutertrei</em> determined from plankton tows and the equilibrium calcite &delta;<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;profiles in seawater predicted from temperature and salinity. However, Mg/Ca ratios were not consistently related to temperature (or pH), suggesting that the Mg/Ca paleothermometer is not reliable in this species.</p>\n<p>Our research also provided insights into the ecology of <em>N. dutertrei</em> and similar species, and into the environmental factors controlling Mg/Ca incorporation into shell calcite. Using high-resolution LA-ICP-MS profiles through the shell wall, combined with NanoSIMS mapping of Mg distributions in shell cross-sections, we demonstrated that high and low Mg/Ca bands in <em>N. dutertrei</em> shells are triggered by changes in light. Based on these Mg/Ca patterns, we developed a new conceptual model to explain the calcification process in this and similar foraminiferal species. Other experiments revealed that high Ba/Ca ratios observed in thermocline-dwelling species are caused by shell formation within barium-rich seawater, leading us to propose that they spend part of their life cycle attached to organic particles containing Ba concentrations much higher than in the seawater around them.</p>\n<p>Finally, in addition to our experiments, we provided colleagues access to the infrastructure required for culturing foraminifera for other experiments on related questions. These collaborations led to new discoveries about how carbon movement within foraminifera and about foraminifera-microbial relationships.</p>\n<p>Our results have been published in ten journal articles, with two additional papers in review and one in progress.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ann&nbsp;Russell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261519/1261519_10251576_1536270064946_DSC_0553--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261519/1261519_10251576_1536270064946_DSC_0553--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
