 "awd_abstract_narration": "RPR (An Approach for Recruitment, Persistence, and Retention of CS/ITS Students) provides full four-year scholarships to a cohort of 13 academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged majors in Computer Science and Information Technology & Systems majors. Recruitment initiatives focus on program features that have broad appeal to a diverse population of students, including women.  RPR's intellectual merit is grounded in its coordination of initiatives found to be effective in recruiting and retaining students.   The program features a cohort approach to learning, including a common freshman year experience where students participate in a two-semester active learning CS sequence, a self-management course that aids in student persistence and retention, and a discrete mathematics course.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, students have opportunities to engage in applied research and internships and to be paired with industry mentors.  Program evaluation focuses on the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in attracting a diverse cohort and on core program features in aiding student achievement, persistence and retention.  The broader impact of RPR is to promote growth and diversity in the CS/ITS field and to disseminate evaluation findings through peer-reviewed publications such as the Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and the Journal of Computer Sciences in Colleges.",

With NSF funding, this project a) coordinated new recruitment initiatives to attract broader representation of the general population, including females; b) developed and highlighted freshman courses that were of greater interest to a wider population of students;  c) had the students participate in a freshman learning community; and d) evaluated the modified recruitment strategy and retention initiatives.\n\nA key recruitment incentive was the selected cohort students received full tuition, and room and board scholarships.  In order to retain the cohort students, supplemental instruction and tutoring, special advisement, industry mentoring, career placement services, applied research and internship opportunities, and extracurricular activities were offered to the cohort students.\n\nNew recruitment initiatives focused on promoting the NSF Technology Scholarships with a larger and more diverse population, especially targeting qualifying students across the country from underrepresented student groups in technology; including females, and financially disadvantaged students.\n\nThe NSF Scholarship program proved very effective in attracting students to the CS/ITS majors.

Marist's Admissions Office promotes the Technology Scholarship during their recruitment visits across the country.  They also promote the scholarship to all students visiting the college and hold Open Houses each fall and spring.
