 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of innovative ocean observing and animal telemetry technology over Palmer Deep (Western Antarctic Peninsula; WAP) is leading to new understanding, and also to many new questions related to polar ecosystem processes and their control by bio-physical interactions in the polar environment. This multi-platform field study will investigate the impact of coastal physical processes (e.g. tides, currents, upwelling events, sea-ice) on Ad\u00e9lie penguin foraging ecology in the vicinity of Palmer Deep, off Anvers Island, WAP. Guided by real-time surface convergence and divergences based on remotely sensed surface current maps derived from a coastal network of High Frequency Radars (HFRs), a multidisciplinary research team will adaptively sample the distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton, which influence Ad\u00e9lie penguin foraging ecology, to understand how local oceanographic processes structure the ecosystem. \r\n\r\nCore educational objectives of this proposal are to increase awareness and \r\nunderstanding of (i) global climate change, (ii) the unique WAP ecosystem, (iii) innovative methods and technologies used by the researchers, and (iv) careers in ocean sciences, through interactive interviews with scientists, students, and technicians, during the field work. These activities will be directed towards instructional programming for K-16 students and their teachers. Researchers and educators will conduct formative and summative evaluation to improve the educational program and measure its impacts respectively.",

By examining predator foraing behavior at the individual level, we were able to conduct a unique analysis of this important marine ecological hotspot, and illustrate the role fine scale environmental cues have on top predator foraging behavior and potential prey fields. We found that Ad?lie and gentoo penguins used different environmental cues in the same foraging habitats.
