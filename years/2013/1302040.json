These areas are: network design and modeling, mobility services on a large scale, and optical networking.  The workshop will bring together key researchers from the US and Japan these three areas of computer networking.   Japan brings unique research strengths to each of the major areas and US research can be expected to benefit from the exposure to the Japanese technology.    Moreover, the areas under discussion are expected to have significant long-term impact on US network research infrastructures.   To facilitate dissemination of workshop results the PI will maintain a public website containing workshop presentations and reports.",
