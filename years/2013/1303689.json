 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) are kinetic phenomena observed near planetary bow shocks that are characterized by heated plasma and flow deflection. The objective of this proposal is to determine the properties of HFAs and their generating mechanisms. The study will systematically survey two types of HFAs. They are traditional HFAs which are associated with interplanetary magnetic field discontinuities and spontaneous HFAs which occur in the absence of magnetic field discontinuities. This study will use a large data base from the Cluster and THEMIS satellites coupled with analytic theory and hybrid simulations.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) is a young woman assistant professor and this grant will support a female graduate student. The results of this study will be used in the PI's classes. She will make the data base available.",

HFAs are universal phenomena. HFAs have been observed at the bow shock of the Earth, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury. HFAs may have a substantial impact on the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction because they drive magnetopause boundary waves, transmit compressional waves into the magnetosphere that can excite resonant ULF waves and cause particles to scatter into the loss cone and precipitate into the ionosphere, generate field-aligned currents in the magnetosphere that drive magnetic impulse events in the high-latitude ionosphere, and trigger transient auroral brightenings.

HFAs are thought to result from the interaction between interplanetary discontinuities and Earth's bow shock. Since there are much more interplanetary discontinuities than HFAs, the question is what kind of discontinuities are more efficient to generate HFAs. We found that magnetic field on at least one side of the interplanetary discontinuities has to be connected to the bow shock in order to form HFAs. Discontinuities with large shear angles are more efficient to form HFAs. Current sheets with thickness from 1000 km to about 3162 km are more efficient to form HFAs. HFAs are more likely to form when the reflected flow from the bow shock is along the discontinuity. An original upstream discontinuity in the vicinity of an HFA and/or at least one side of the HFA with the convective electric field pointing toward the discontinuity is not a necessary condition to generate an HFA. It has been found that the HFA occurrence rate depends on solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions as well as distance from the bow shock. HFA occurrence decreases with distance upstream from the bow shock. HFAs are more prevalent when there is an approximately radial interplanetary magnetic field. HFAs occur most preferentially for high solar wind. The second major finding of this project concerns the characteristics of HFAs at different evolution stages (young or mature). We found that both ion and electron spectra can be used to classify young and mature HFAs.
