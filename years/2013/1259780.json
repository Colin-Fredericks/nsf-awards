It includes invited lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers (with good representation of female scholars), and contributed lectures and posters by students and experts on the biology and technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a changing world. There is an emphasis on enabling young scientists and students to present their work.",
