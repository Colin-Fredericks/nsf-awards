The goal of the study is to develop and validate predictive models for bimodal and multi-regime combustion dynamics.  The state-of-the-art transported probability density function (PDF) approach is employed as the modeling framework.  A recently developed statistically transient jet flame is chosen as the main target flame for the modeling and simulation.  The study will advance understanding of bimodal and multi-regime turbulent combustion physics and should facilitate future model development and validation for replicating these complicated combustion dynamics.  The accurate and efficient predictive models should enable design of clean combustors for applications in transportation vehicles and propulsion systems.  The proposed work will enhance computational engineering through innovations in computational practice and the use of cyberinfrastructure.  Integration of the research results into both undergraduate and graduate courses is aimed to enhance current engineering curriculum.",
