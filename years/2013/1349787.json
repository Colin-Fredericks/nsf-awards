 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Program award is to perform research into a control-theoretic approach to robust design, appropriate for complex engineered system design. A robust design is a design possessing relatively invariant performance in the presence of various uncertainties. Current approaches to robust design are suitable primarily for designing established consumer products or updating existing system designs; these approaches are not appropriate for the design of large complex systems, such as spacecraft or smart grids, where primary uncertainties, such as environmental, budgeting, or new technology performance, are resolved in time. The research approach taken in this work treats the design process as a stochastic control problem in which the goal is to best align the system design for the current conditions and information available in a given time period. The design process is represented using a state-space model which is solved using Kalman recursion. The research tasks include formulating a motivating aerospace design problem which illustrates the challenges of complex system design, collecting environmental data to enable solution of the state-space model, and finally deriving and solving the governing stochastic control equations.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will provide the basis for a general theory of complex system robust design. Currently, there is a lack of theory, and subsequent methodology, for the robust design of complex engineered systems, leading to frequent cost and schedule overruns and potentially undesirable performance. The approach taken in this research will be unique in that it will transform the design process from a static process of optimizing the design in a defined design phase to a dynamic process of controlling the design throughout its lifecycle. The proposed research will benefit not only the academic community, but also designers of complex engineered systems working in government agencies and large corporations.",

The results of this work will inform a broad range of engineering design activity, from consumer products to large-scale engineered systems. To realize the theory of dynamic design, we have introduced a control-theoretic approach to system design, in which states of interest to the designer, such as the state of system health or market demand, are &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by the system design. These states of interest are uncertain, and represent epistemic uncertainties, versus statistical (or aleatoric) uncertainties. In this work, we examined the dynamic design of a satellite communication system. In this case study, the design is the number of satellites, and their altitudes, while the state of interest to the designer is demand for communication services. The satellite system was designed with flexibility, such that we could update the system design throughout its life, based upon the demand for communication services (Fig. 1). The design of the satellite system was continually modified to best fulfill the demand for communication services at the lowest cost. As demonstrated, this proposed dynamic design approach enables the \"control\" of the state of interest throughout time to enable the best design for each time frame, while being robust to remaining uncertainties (Fig. 2).
