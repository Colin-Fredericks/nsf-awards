 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a linguistic ethnography of how connections among people, words, and things collectively shape global trade in indigenous plants. The research is set in Oaxaca, Mexico, one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world; it is also among the most linguistically diverse, with 16 language groupings and more than a hundred linguistic variants occupying a region roughly the size of the state of Indiana. Many of the region's plants have been used for centuries by the state's indigenous peoples during religious medicinal rituals. Some have recently become widely available on a global basis, sold worldwide by cyber and other vendors. In most countries the sale and use of these plants remains legal, and some of the most popular are now advertised by thousands of online videos documenting users' experiences. Though biomedical researchers are interested in the pharmaceutical and medical potential of such plants, some are also increasingly criminalized due their ostensible side effects. While scientific research on such plants is in its infancy, popular and journalistic discussion of some have implicated them in such social ills as addiction to \"harder drugs,\" suicide, and homicide. This NSF-funded research project analyzes this new global trade, focusing on how the different practices and discourses people use to interact with these plant saturate them with conflicting forms of value. Methodologically, this project joins close analysis of both language use and other forms of semiotic representation deployed in interactions involving the plant with anthropological study of the history and political economy of these emerging global commodity chains. This research has implications for a wide range of other cases where formally local \"things\" sit at the intersection of competing social agendas. In addition, as states around the country debate banning these plants and other new botanical substances, this research has significant policy implications as the first social scientific study of the communities that have sprung up around these plants' use and sale.",

But of the family&rsquo;s roughly 7000 species, <em>Salvia divinorum</em> has special medical significance. A psychoactive plant, it is endemic to only one place on earth: the Sierra Mazateca, a mountainous region of Oaxaca state, in southern Mexico. Indigenous people from the region have been using the plant in religious curing and divinatory rituals for centuries, and until relatively recently the plant was almost unknown outside their communities. Over the last two decades, however, the plant has become a global commodity. Sold worldwide by both online and brick-and-mortar vendors, the plant now attracts interest from recreational users across the globe as well as pharmacological researchers interested in studying and exploiting the unique biochemical properties of the plant's active agent, the most potent naturally occurring psychedelic substance known to science.&nbsp; As a result of the plant&rsquo;s rise to global prominence, a range of people now competes to determine the plant&rsquo;s value. These include not only diverse groups of indigenous people from the plant&rsquo;s home region but also many types of people in the United States and other countries to which the plant is exported. Such &ldquo;newcomers&rdquo; to the social universe surrounding salvia include biomedical researchers, who see in research on the plant the promise of new insights into the workings of the human nervous system and the potential for developing new drugs to treat a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp; Other groups of people now interested in the plant&rsquo;s status include politicians seeking to ban the plant -- who link its usage to homicide, suicide, addiction to &ldquo;harder drugs,&rdquo; and other social ills &ndash; as well as activists and other users, who celebrate the plant&rsquo;s benefits, advocate for its restriction-free availability, and &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; the plant&rsquo;s powers in online videos documenting their experiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research project studied this contested field surrounding salvia, treating the case as a &ldquo;natural experiment&rdquo; whose recent origins and contained scope can shed light on myriad other cases where formerly local products have &ldquo;gone global.&rdquo; More specifically, the project took the approach that understanding salvia&rsquo;s rise and its meaning in the world today cannot be understood without analyzing both the political economies and semiotic ecologies that envelop the plant. In other words, one of the project&rsquo;s central claims is that the global circulation and importance of salvia and commodities like it depend not only on political and economic factors but also to symbolic ones, as salvia&rsquo;s meaning is determined not only by markets and policies but also by the myriad ways people represent salvia, coupling it with other symbols and also turning the plant into a symbol itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project resulted in numerous publications and presentations, both scholarly and popular, existing and forthcoming, in English as well as Spanish. Theoretically, one of the project&rsquo;s key interventions involved synthesizing bodies of literature rarely brought into dialogue in order to forge a novel, unified framework for studying commodity chains that offers new perspectives on the construction of value. In addition, the project contributes to broader societal conversations about such pressing issues as drug policy, drug use and treatment, the ethics of international trade, the politics surrounding intellectual property rights and multinational business practice, etc. Finally, a particular focus of the project &ndash; and a key direction at which project outcomes were aimed &ndash; concerns how the ongoing salvia trade affects people in the plant&rsquo;s homeland, who have long used and cared for salvia. A marginalized indigenous group, they are responsible for the plant&rsquo;s very existence, and salvia&rsquo;s presence in our world today is indebted to generations of care and propagation by people living in that region. The project's collaboration with people from the plant&rsquo;s home region incorporated their perspectives in ways that most representations of the salvia trade have not done, documenting and making visible their claims to the plant's future that in many accounts about salvia are downplayed or even erased outright.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
