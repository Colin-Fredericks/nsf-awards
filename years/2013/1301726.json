 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this five-year project, Nevada Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NV-EPSCoR) addresses critical practical problems of relevance to large-scale solar installations in arid desert lands.  The project combines research on solar thermal energy generation with the understanding of eco-hydrological impacts of solar installation in desert regions to advance the economic and eco-friendly viability of solar electricity generation.  This combination distinguishes this project from several other existing solar energy projects, thus making it a unique model study of relevance to Nevada and other solar installations in the US and around the world.  The major participating institutions in this project are: the University of Nevada, Reno, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute.  Faculty and students from the College of Southern Nevada, Truckee Meadows Community College, and Nevada State College will also be engaged in this project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nDespite plentiful sunlight and cloud-free days which are conducive for solar energy collection, arid regions experience frequent dust storms and receive little or no rain.  Dust accumulated on solar panels absorb sunlight and decrease the efficiency of solar cells; water scarcity increases the cost of meeting the cooling needs of solar thermal collectors.  This project seeks to develop engineering/technological solutions to repel dust and minimize water usage in large solar installations.  In addition, it examines the desert ecosystem responses and provides science-based information for designing effective ways to manage and mitigate environmental impacts associated with large-scale solar installations.  The award establishes a research facility, called the Nevada Environment, Water, and Solar Testing and Research Facility (NEW-STAR) during this project.  Enhancements to the existing cyberinfrastructure capabilities are effected through the creation of the Nevada Research Data Center (NRDC) for data management and communication.  These new facilities promote collaboration among teams of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers on solar-energy-water-environment nexus research and education theme.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project has the potential to develop less costly and thus more competitive solar electricity generation techniques aimed at minimizing both water usage and environmental degradation.  The technological solutions to be developed are applicable to other solar energy installations nationally and globally.  Interactions among scientists and collaboration at regional, national, and international levels as well as partnerships with energy industry and environmental agencies in Nevada are expected to promote economic development in the state.  The project involves 41 faculty, 24 technicians, 43 graduate students, and 38 undergraduate students as participants.  The project offers the following programs aimed at pre-college and undergraduate students with a focus to attract underrepresented minority groups, K-12 teachers, and the general public: (1) Pre-college bridging programs to assist K-12 students to develop academic skills and career pathways; (2) Undergraduate research opportunity programs (UROP) to provide research experience at the solar energy-water-environment nexus; (3) Undergraduate and graduate hands-on training (HOT) to facilitate transition from student to professional; activities include industry internships and laboratory experiences in solar energy technology, and proposal writing workshops; (4) Teacher professional development programs that engage K-12 teachers in research, field work, and working with graduate students; (5) programs to educate K-12 students on project related themes and inform their families of opportunities for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers; and (6) Online learning laboratories, which provide wireless access to cyber learning materials and enhance public understanding of solar energy and related impacts on water and environment.",

Understand Environmental Impacts of Solar Plants Spatiotemporal responses of plants to the large-scale facility in Eldorado Valley, NV were monitored with various sensors.  Simulations using HYDRUS 2D were performed to study impacts of solar arrays on water infiltration.  Ecological adaptation of 2 biological soil crust species from the Mojave Desert were subjected to UV irradiation, rapid succession of dry-wet cycles, and fumigation in ozone.  Thermal effects of utility-scale solar energy plants on the landscape were studied using pre- and post-installation land surface temperature at Copper Mountain Solar One.  Quantification of vegetation recovery after a disturbance was measured in 220 vegetation plots.  Restoration protocols were developed for perennial grasses useful for revegetation at solar facilities.\n\n \n\nO3 ? Develop Sustainable and Advances Water/Wastewater approaches to support water needs for solar energy development.\n\n \n\nThe feasibility of using solar energy for the operation of 3 drinking water treatment plants was evaluated.  Membrane distillation of solar facility waters research included surfactant effects to identify surfactant concentrations that MD membranes can accommodate.  Construction of the Nevada Solar Water Express trailer, which houses advanced water/solar technologies to support research on energy and water issues, was completed.\n\n \n\nO4 ? Improve Reliability, Modeling, and Sunlight forecasting for renewable/solar energy supply.\n\n \n\nThe microgrid facility was used for experiments operating in stand-alone mode and in parallel with the local grid.  A battery energy storage system was integrated with the microgrid, providing more flexibility and power quality.  Solar forecasts in the 5-15 min range use real-time environmental data and imagery from the sky.  These were assessed for integration into grid operations.\n\n \n\nO5 ? Develop new and use existing cyberinfrastructure capabilities to accelerate the NEXUS research.\n\n \n\nData Processing and Analysis: Microservice architecture was designed and implemented to provide access to environmental data collected across Nevada.  This was used for wind-speed forecasting and other model inputs.  A course in Data Mining was developed with this as a data source.\n\n \n\nCommunication Networks: Remote research network improvements were made across backbone microwave links.  Power systems design was improved, as were field deployment/installation practices.  Wintertime reliability was increased, and security improved.\n\n \n\nProject Outputs, Integration, and Collaborations\n\nDuring the course of the project, 178 scholarly, peer-reviewed articles were published. There were 15 thesis/dissertations. Twenty-three other products were created, including six videos, two databases, 11 software products, two websites, and two educational aids. 170 proposals were submitted, and 72 proposals were awarded funding totaling $63,231,624. \n\nParticipants reported 78 collaborations within Nevada. 309 scholarships were awarded to undergraduate students, 152 of whom are female.  Outreach efforts reached more than 12,000 K-12 participants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick C Harris"
