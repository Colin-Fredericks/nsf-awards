To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world, and to do this they must attend international scientific meetings. These meetings provide a forum for interacting with other researchers, forming collaborations, presenting new results and participating in the international scientific community. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide support for approximately 150 US astronomers, postdocs, and students to participate in international professional meetings. This award will be especially important to early-career scientists and those from less-endowed institutions as it will help give them the opportunity to actively participate in these important meetings.",
