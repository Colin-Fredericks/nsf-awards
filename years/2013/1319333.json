 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop scalable techniques and system architectures for transaction management in cloud computing systems.  In the recent years, various data management systems based on key-value storage models have emerged to address the scalability requirements of cloud based applications. However, these systems do not provide rich data management primitives, such as multi-row serializable transactions, often needed in many application domains. This project is investigating scalable transaction management techniques for key-value based data storage systems with the aim of supporting multi-row transactions with ACID (atomicity, isolation, durability, consistency) properties in such systems.  For scalability, this investigation is based on utilizing the snapshot isolation model.  Additional issues arise in supporting transaction management for geographically replicated data across different cloud datacenters.  Considering that weaker consistency models can be adequate in certain applications, this project aims to develop techniques for supporting different transactional consistency models such as snapshot isolation, causal consistency, serializability, and session-level consistency for geo-replicated data in cloud applications.  Moreover, the goal of this project is to exploit the semantics of data operations for enhanced performance and availability. \r\n\r\nThis project aims at enabling the use of key-value based cloud data storage models for a large-class of applications with various different data consistency requirements. The lack of transaction support with strong consistency models in cloud computing systems has been an obstacle in adoption of such systems in many critical application domains. A potentially transformative impact of this project will be towards enabling a broader class of applications to utilize cloud computing systems.\r\n\r\n",

This result is reported in a journal paper [3]. The investigation on transaction management for partially replicated data management systems resulted in the development of the Partitioned Causal Snapshot Isolation (PCSI) protocol. The design of this protocol is reported in a paper [2]. Further refinements of this protocol to scale-out its performance on a computing cluster of 100 nodes is reported in another publication [8]. This work received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Cloud Computing (2016) conference. Building upon this transaction management protocol, a model was developed for simultaneously supporting transactions with different consistency levels in an application. This model supports transactions in four classes of consistency levels. serializable, causal snapshot isolation (CSI), causal snapshot isolation with concurrent commutative updates (CSI-CM), and asynchronous updates with eventual/causal consistency. This work is reported in a paper [10], and the use of this model in groupware applications is reported in [4]. Another significant outcome from this project is the development of the Beehive [6, 7] framework for parallel programming of graph problems. It is based on a transactional model of parallel computing. Since its initial design reported in [6] we achieved more than 50-fold performance scaling of this system. This required a multi-pronged approach to overcome many of the issues which arise due to the use of Java RMI serialization costs in remote data access and garbage collection overheads of Java. The current system supports a hybrid model using both Thrift and Java RMI because Thrift performs better than Java RMI but does not support object-class hierarchy in communication. For further performance scaling, a decentralized protocol for transaction validation was developed. Utilizing the transactional computing model of Beehive, this project developed incremental computation techniques in dynamic&nbsp; and evolving graph structures.
