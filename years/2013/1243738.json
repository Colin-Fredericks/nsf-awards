 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nNutrient cycling in the environment is carried out by complex microbial communities.  Unraveling the network of organismal interactions that drive carbon and nitrogen cycling in nature is a challenging task given the taxonomic, functional, and biochemical diversity of most natural systems. This project will study a series of environmentally derived freshwater and marine photosynthetic microbial communities that grow using cellulose and dinitrogen as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively.  These communities contain distinct populations that can degrade nitrogen-poor cellulose, fix atmospheric N2, and harvest light energy through photosynthesis at different light wavelengths under anaerobic conditions. The goal of this research is to generate new insights into the links between community structure, productivity, and organismal interactions that produce stable nutrient-cycling microbial systems by using biochemical, molecular, and model-based analyses.  These environmentally derived consortia can provide insight into how renewable resources such as cellulose, N2, and light can be efficiently converted into cell biomass and other usable products under marine and freshwater conditions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research will be conducted at the primarily undergraduate institution, Olin College and the non-profit research institution, Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). The interaction between these institutions will provide rich opportunities for undergraduate training. Undergraduates will be strongly involved in all cultivation, biochemical, and physiological characterization of consortia at Olin College. They will be exposed to cutting edge techniques in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics at the MBL. This will provide valuable experience, encouragement and preparation for graduate programs and for a range of careers in science. The data generated by this research will be brought into the classroom and integrated into curricula to enhance student learning of bioinformatics using authentic data.  Undergraduates will be involved in all aspects of this research, will present results at scientific meetings, and will co-author manuscripts.",
