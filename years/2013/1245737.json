 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AAWS) network, first commenced in 1978, is the most extensive ground meteorological network in the Antarctic, approaching its 30th year at several of its installations. Its prime focus as a long term observational record is to measure the near surface weather and climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS sites measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of 3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be measured. Observational data from the AWS are collected via the DCS Argos system aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. \r\n\r\nThe surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The surface observations from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite and remote sensing observations.",

As part of this project we maintained a network of automatic weather stations (AWS) that observe the temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds across the surface of the Antarctic continent. This is the largest network of surface weather observations in the Antarctic and data from this network is fed into global weather models, helping to improve weather forecasts across the planet. This network has provided weather observations from the Antarctic for more than 30 years, and this long-term record of Antarctic weather is critical for assessing how Antarctic climate has changed over the past several decades. During this project a 100 foot &ldquo;tall tower&rdquo; AWS has been installed enabling the detailed study of the boundary layer and lower portion of the Antarctic atmosphere. We also explored the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), or drones, to make meteorological measurements in the Antarctic. While inappropriate use of drones has received much negative attention we found that UAS can also provide high quality data at a much lower cost than traditional manned research flights, thus offering the potential for cost savings for future Antarctic (and beyond) research.</p>\n<p>Using data from the AWS and UAS we explored the fundamental processes that control the weather and climate of Antarctica. Our work on this project has studied extreme weather events, using AWS data, and has described how the atmosphere and underlying ice sheet interact through the boundary layer. We have used our AWS and UAS observations to evaluate a numerical weather prediction model used for weather forecasting in the Antarctic. The basis for this forecast model is also used for weather forecasting and research in the mid-latitudes and our analysis of this model, using data from the Antarctic, has helped to improve this model for all regions.</p>\n<p>An important part of all scientific research is communicating our findings to other scientists, and we have done this this by attending scientific meetings and conferences and publishing our results in peer reviewed scientific journals.

We also conduct outreach by visiting, either in person or online, students in elementary schools.
