 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this CAREER proposal is to establish a strong interdisciplinary program in micro/nanofluidic systems and biochemical/analytical technologies. A novel microfluidic screening platform integrated with multiple functional components for various biochemical and analytical processes will be developed based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic (DMF) principle. \r\nMultiplexing (e.g. fluidic circuit) capability of EWOD DMF is a unique and attractive feature to enable high throughput screening (HTS) platform. With this capability, HTS platform for 3D cell/tissue based bioassay processes will be developed and investigated. Various functions of EWOD DMF that never have been explored yet will be investigated and enabled. Such novel attempts include on-chip 3D cell and tissue culture solely by EWOD DMF, unit functions of bio-separation including on-chip aqueous two-phase system extraction, and novel detection/sensing methods enabled by EWOD DMF such as cut-off frequency sensor and ion-selective sensor array. This CAREER project also aims to tackle current limitations of EWOD DMF such as the volume accuracy and consistency in drop dispensing, and operation of non-aqueous fluids. \r\nWith a successful integration of the proposed HTS, following important outcomes are expected. First, various bioassay data can be analyzed in a single cell and tissue sample with high reproducibility. Second, high-throughput of the bio-molecule separation will be ensured. Third, the kinetic study of fast bio-reaction process such as metabolomic reaction of metabolites will be enabled. In addition, one can easily optimize the cell specific extraction/drug efficacy conditions. The platform will enable a large number of samples in one analytical run, which will remove the problems that arise when comparing data within different batches of samples.\r\nImpacts of a successful result in the proposed research will not be limited to bioassay optimization. These results could bring transformations into wide range of chemical synthesis and analytical techniques based on cells and tissues. Immediate applications are expected in the field of drug discovery, catalyst development, disease biomarker identifications and point-of-care devices but not limited. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, educational endeavors will focus to nurture and train graduate and undergraduate students as future work forces with abundant experiences in bio- and nano- technology on top of solid foundation of conventional mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge. Research outcomes will be incorporated into the multi-disciplinary courses. Separate efforts will be made to bridge K-12 students and teachers with microscale science and engineering knowledge through outreach programs to inspire K-12 students to pursue higher education in engineering. Disseminating research outcome through various ways including interactive website/blog, peer-reviewed articles, conferences, public media are proposed.\r\n",

In this development, the team focused to investigate various functionalities of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidics. In EWOD digital microfluidics, motions of liquids are controlled by electric field. This can create tiny volume (~ 100 nL) of liquid droplets and can transport them as a user programs. This droplet microfluidic function can benefit many biological and chemical analysis protocols.</p>\n<p>:: Outcome Summary ::</p>\n<p>First, a proof-of-concept device where human breast cancer cells are cultured in 3-dimensionally as closely emulating cancer cells in a patient body environment has been designed, built, and tested. In this device, the cytotoxicity of different concentrations of chemicals has been evaluated as successfully demonstrating the drug screening capability of this device. Micrographs of device operation and test results are shown in Figures 1 and 2. This demonstration promises that EWOD digital microfluidics can provide suitable platform to perform drug screening in the context of biological effect. It also promises that patient specific screening of drugs can be done in low resource environments such as a small clinic and underdeveloped regions of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, an electrohydrodynamic model has been developed. This model enabled easy and quick prediction of movability of a liquid in EWOD digital microfluidics. Knowing the movability of a liquid is crucial to develop a microfluidic device to perform particular biological/chemical protocols (Figure 3). This outcome has significant intellectual merit in electrohydrodynamic microfluidic society. Until this point, the effect of frequency of input signal to EWOD (and/or dielectrophoretic) device has been neglected. We found that input frequency can vary the force on a droplet significantly, so that the movability of droplet would vary, too. Some liquids that has been known to be unmovable in EWOD for a longtime was found to be partially movable through this research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, microfluidic function of target biomolecule separation has been developed and demonstrated (Figures 4 and 5). Figure 4 shows that green dye molecules from binary solution (green + yellow) were successfully separated from yellow molecules. Figure 5 shows the preliminary demonstration of DNA separation from aqueous sample to ionic liquid phase in EWOD digital microfluidics. This technology would provide much simpler, faster, and more cost-effective ways to separate DNAs, RNAs, and proteins from raw samples compared to currently existing laboratory techniques. This outcome has broader effects to many research areas in medical science ? genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, cancer biology, synthetic biology and much more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last, an reconfigurable ion-selective sensor array has been developed and integrated into EWOD digital microfluidic device. The sensor array we developed successfully measured concentration of Na+, K+, Ca2+ ions from a single droplet of blood plasma emulator. This integrated sensor array will be useful to run various types of cell-based assays in a digital microfluidics. It also has many broader impacts. This sensor platform provides an outstanding candidate for a portable home-use for continuous monitoring of ions thanks to its advantages such as easy automation of sample preparation and detection processes, elongated sensor lifetime, minimal sample consumption and user-definable/reconfigurable capabilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/31/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hyejin&nbsp;Moon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254602/1254602_10229792_1548955320093_Outcome1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254602/1254602_10229792_1548955320093_Outcome1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1 Creation of a microdisc of 3D breast cancer cells\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1254602/1254602_10229792_1548955320093_Outcome1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1 Creation of a microdisc of 3D breast cancer cells\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Snapshots showing the sequence of creating a microdisc (0.5 mm diameter) of hydrogel which contains human breast cancer cells in the EWOD digital microfluidic device.
