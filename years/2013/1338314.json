 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) has met annually since 1981. It was initiated by members of the Department of Mathematics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and has since then rotated among various research institutions in the Southeast. This year, the 33rd SEARCDE conference will be held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), September 21 and 22, 2013. Continuing SEARCDE's tradition, the conference is a forum to discuss, exchange recent advances in both theoretical and applied areas of differential equations. Besides four invited plenary talks, there will be many contributed talks with a wide range of topics organized in parallel sessions. Young researchers are encouraged to give talks, will receive helpful feedback, and can benefit from interactions with a diverse group of plenary lecturers. The invited plenary lectures will broaden the participants' knowledge about current researchand techniques in differential equations and its applications. Many contributed talks and the networking opportunities will contribute to the exchange of research ideas and the formation of new collaborations. Information about the conference can be found at the meeting website. http://www.math.utk.edu/SEARCDE2013.\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of SEARCDE conference is to promote research and education in the field of differential equations by bringing together established and beginning researchers, including advanced undergraduate and graduates students as well as recent PhD's.  The meeting provides a platform to exchange ideas and to discuss recent developments in the field, both in applied and theoretical differential equations.  SEARCDE particularly encourages the participation of beginning researchers, for whom the opportunities offered by regional conferences are important, especially those from traditionally under-represented groups. Indeed, it is often the case that a researcher in the field will have presented her research findings for the first time at a meeting like SEARCDE. NSF funding will ensure that many talented young researchers will have the opportunity to participate in SEARCDE 2013.",
