The conference is being held in Boston MA during the period of September 22-28.  ICFP is the premier conference on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming and the meeting includes eight related workshops and symposia.  ICFP is the premier conference on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.",
