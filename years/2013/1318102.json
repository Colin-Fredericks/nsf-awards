 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roughly 8 billion moles of methane (CH4) were emitted in 83 days during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the northern Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Interestingly, none of this CH4 was emitted to the atmosphere, but instead stayed dissolved and suspended as \"plume\" or \"intrusion\" layers approximately 1000m below the ocean surface. Based on measurements of CH4 concentration and oxidation rates, dissolved oxygen anomalies, and microbial community structure as well as a CH4 geochemical model, it was determined that all the CH4 emitted during this disaster was respired within 120 days of the initial well blowout. In addition, the methanotrophic bacteria responsible for the oxidation of this CH4 appeared to experience all stages of microbial growth, limited only by the availability of CH4. This finding suggests that releases of CH4 into deepwater, be them anthropogenic or natural, will have minimal direct influence on the radiative budget of the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness in these previous investigations is that CH4 related parameters were only measured at the beginning (May - June 2010) and end (September - October 2010) of this massive CH4 feast, primarily because the rapid demise of CH4 was unanticipated. Thus, the time- and growth phase-dependent understanding of the kinetics of this bloom response is only based on model interpolation between endpoints. A more complete, and measurement-based, understanding of the chemical kinetics is necessary to predict an oceanographic environment's ability to respire large CH4 perturbations. And while measurements of CH4 stable isotopes in theory can be used to assess the extent that the released CH4 has been oxidized, this kinetic isotope effect can only be used in a quantitative fashion if it is known how the isotopic fractionation factor changes with varying chemical and temperature conditions and throughout all stages of the microbial bloom. \r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers at the Texas A & M University will test two fundamental hypotheses relating to aerobic CH4 oxidation and ultimately produce a thorough characterization of the time-, growth phase-, and temperature-dependency of CH4 oxidation rates, oxidation rate constants, and isotopic fractionation factors.   Hypothesis 1: Excluding mixing processes, the bacterial response to a large CH4 perturbation will be limited primarily by the availability of CH4 or dissolved oxygen.   Hypothesis 2: Without knowing the stage of microbial growth, measurements of natural stable isotopes of CH4 and dissolved carbon (organic and/or inorganic) cannot be used to assess the extent of CH4 oxidation in situations of large CH4 perturbations. In order to test these hypotheses, with the goal of disproving hypothesis 2, a suite of mesocosm and pure culture incubations will be conducted. Throughout these incubations, concentrations of CH4 and dissolved inorganic carbon as well as their 13C isotopes will be measured in extremely high resolution with new equipment and experimental designs. In addition, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations, trace metals, CH4 oxidation rates, and microbial community structure will be measured. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. In addition to the normal dissemination of results in publications, meeting presentations, and on a project web site, this work will have strong educational and research impacts with close interactions between the PIs, postdoctoral scholar, graduate student, and undergraduate researchers with collaborations between Texas A&M University and the University of California Santa Barbara. The students will have extended visits at each lab for skill development, knowledge transfer, and general academic growth. During 2010, an informal collaboration was established with Ms. Vicki Soutar, a high school science teacher in Watkinsville, GA, to develop high school science laboratory exercises using real scientific data. This proposed project will involve Ms. Soutar to formalize, enhance, extend, and disseminate the products of this collaboration",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately eight million moles of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, were released.  Interestingly, all of that methane appeared to have dissolved in the deep Gulf waters and was not emitted to the atmosphere.  In addition, numerous lines of evidence suggest that a significant portion of this methane was microbially oxidized within four months after the start of this disaster.  However, this methane oxidation event occurred over an area of approximately 73,000 square kilometers and a time period of roughly four months, thus a thorough understanding of (1) the kinetics of methane oxidation, (2) what may have enhanced or limited this reaction, and (3) how these properties changed over space and time were not obtained.  Since natural releases of methane from the seafloor have been observed to increase with increasing ocean temperature, a more thorough understanding of methane oxidation kinetics has impacts beyond anthropogenic disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The overarching goal of this project was to determine the efficiency of methane oxidation and how it may be different in different regions with different chemical, biological, and physical conditions.  The results of this investigation are enabling a better understanding of the ultimate fate of methane released from the seafloor, be those releases natural or anthropogenic. \n\n \n\nThis project began by developing a new technique enabling the real-time and automated analyses of chemical and isotopic changes in seawater during a methane oxidation event.  This technique developed a reservoir to house large volumes of seawater cleanly and to maintain that level of cleanliness over a period of several months.  Also, a system was engineered for the automated, user-defined analysis and collection of numerous parameters from these large seawater samples such as the concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and trace metals, the isotopes of methane and carbon dioxide, and biological properties such as cell counts and microbial community structure.  The application of these techniques was the central focus of two oceanographic expeditions, one to the northern Gulf of Mexico, adjacent to the location of the former Deepwater Horizon well, and the other in the Hudson Canyon, US Atlantic Margin.  The Hudson Canyon served to as a contrasting environment and helped to assess how this process is different under different conditions.\n\n \n\nThe results of these experiments are leading to eight scientific publications:  five are fully published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, two have been submitted for publication and are currently in peer-review, and one is in the final stages of preparation.  This project supported several Ph.D. students at two different universities and enabled unique interactions with elementary and high school scientific education programs.  The knowledge gained from these experiments has uncovered numerous unknowns about how methane is aerobically oxidized.  First, after methane is released into seawater, our results suggest that it takes between one and four weeks before methane oxidation rates become aggressive.  Second, once aggressive methane oxidation begins, the oxidation reaction continues for only a few days until it is limited by a reactant.  The specific reactant that ultimately limits this reaction depends on the initial concentration of oxygen or a specific nutrient or trace metal as well as the size of the methane perturbation.  Third, aggressive methane oxidation was observed in waters that were both directly influenced by and not directly influenced by methane bubbles released from the seafloor.  However, the start of aggressive methane oxidation was delayed in waters not directly influenced by natural methane emissions.  Fourth, when methane is oxidized, the lighter natural isotopes of methane react faster than the heavier isotopes leading to a c..."
