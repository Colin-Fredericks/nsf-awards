 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Collaborative Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID) project will collect perishable damage data caused by Hurricane Sandy that made landfall on October 29, 2012. It was a very large storm (almost 800 miles in diameter according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that affected large areas of coastlines of New York (Long Island and New York Metropolitan area) and New Jersey. The storm was judged to be Category 1 based on its wind speed. However, because of its size and coinciding with high lunar tide, it generated high storm surge. The coastline regions received serious damage by the flood due to surge and impact forces of waves. Residential structures along the coastlines sustained severe damage and destruction. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will collect field data of damaged residential buildings focusing on the New Jersey coastal area. Two major goals for collection of data are: (1) to collect perishable data on residential building damage levels, failure modes, and building characteristics (elevation, specific connections/members failed, age); and (2) to find damage gradients, and to identify and quantify their causes. Small teams will evaluate and record data for every residence in the selected region. Data taken will include location, elevations, house type and size, approximate age, large scale storm erosion/accretion, local scale foundation scour, approximate waterlines, visible damage from wind/waves, damage levels, damage/failure modes, specific connection and member failures, and environmental exposure (sheltered behind buildings/dunes, open to sea). Numerous GPS-tagged pictures will be taken of each house from multiple angles. With 3-4 teams of 2 people each, 400-600 houses will be surveyed for the database. These damage data will be used in future research in developing storm surge resistant residential structures.",
