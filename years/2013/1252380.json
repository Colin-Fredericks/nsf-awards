 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this REESE/REAL project, the PIs have the goal of investigating the kinds of feedback that are most effective when students are solving complex problems requiring mathematics or other disciplinary knowledge. When learners are solving such problems in an immersive environment on the computer, technology can both provide feedback to learners and also be used to collect and present data that will allow teachers to know what learners understand and are capable of.  This project examines the effects of different forms of feedback on students' learning and engagement in mathematics. Specifically, the PIs are exploring how different forms of feedback (tied to the problem solving narrative, tied to the disciplinary content, and a blend) and timing of feedback (frequency and relation to major assessment moments) contribute to how students engage in learning activities and what they come to understand. The work is being done in the context of two \"quests\" (complex challenges derived to promote understanding and skills) implemented on the Atlantis Remixed platform (formerly called Quest Atlantis), an immersive computing environment. The two quests are based on two well-researched and effective units from the pre-algebra mathematics curriculum Adventures of Jasper Woodbury. In that curriculum, 5th and 6th graders learn mathematics in the context of solving real-world problems. Refining these units for the Atlantis Remixed platform offers learners possibilities of getting advice and feedback as needed in the context of their mathematics work and more easily accessing resources and representations necessary for solving the problem and sharing insights with fellow learners. In addition to investigating effective ways of providing advice and feedback to learners, PIs are exploring the benefits and challenges of each form of feedback and its timing for providing teachers with frequent and reliable sources of information about their students? understanding and the activities they are engaging in online. \r\n\r\nA challenge to promoting learning in mathematics is giving learners the advice and feedback they need at the times they need it. If learners are solving problems in the context of a computer environment, the computer can be used to provide such feedback. To do that well, researchers need to determine which kinds of feedback should be provided in which kinds of situations and when are the most appropriate times to give feedback, during problem solving work or after problem solving is complete. In this project, the investigators are exploring those questions in the context of pre-algebra mathematics learning.",

Scholars have argued that focusing on such mathematical practices does not simply broaden students' understanding of mathematics, it fundamentally transforms it. However, it has been well established that is can be challenging to support such sophisticated ways of doing math as they represent a fundamental change from much of school math,to which students have grown accustomed.

Students are given access to three ultralight flying machines, and must decide which route to take, which plane to fly, the length and time of the journey, how much gasoline will be required (and where to stop to get it), who will pilot the plane, and whether any additional cargo is necessary (or feasible) given the weight limit of the small aircraft. The problem that students are solving is rich and complex, in that they need to determine what information is relevant and necessary to solve the problem, and, once they have determined this, they must use the information to make a final determination of which plan is best and how long the trip would take. The game plays out the decisions that students make, and students see the consequences of their mathematical decisions: Image 1 shows the outcome if students ran out of gas, causing the plane to crash, Image 2 shows the outcome if the eagle untimely dies, and Image 3 shows a healthy, released eagle.&nbsp; Students are given several chances to try again for a more successful outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit. </strong>The study was designed using a methodology called Design-Based Research&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-041fcecc-7fff-d7e4-d602-87bd07ec8645\"><span>(DBR), which involves cycles of conjecture, design, implementation, and revision. </span></span>The game was revised over several cycles and involved making the following significant changes: adding mathematical tools to support students' reasoning about ratio, adding additional animals to save to advance the complexity and replayability of the game; and connecting the game into a teacher portal that allowed teachers to see, engage, and respond to student work. In the course of this project we addressed myriad research questions that involved student learning, the role of different elements of the game in supporting aspects of student problem solving; how interest was developed and sustained in the game; the ways that the practices of gaming and the practices of schooling come into contact and influence student game play; and diversity of teacher practices in playing the game. Briefly, findings demonstrate that students learn about ratio when playing Boone's Meadow and improve in their problem solving by engaging more elements of the situation and become more reflective about the relationship between their mathematical reasoning and the outcomes they experience in the game. Students in every classroom demonstrated interest in the game and investment in the outcome of it, even as they were all fully aware of the fantasy of the game. This interest was enhanced when the game become incorporated into the overall classroom system that included teachers' enthusiasm and emphasis on game outcomes.
