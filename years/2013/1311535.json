 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of virulence is of critical importance to predicting the outcomes of a disease introduction into a new host population.  Past hypotheses have postulated that the direction of evolution in virulence should be away from antagonistic relationships, but observations on human disease, particularly those borne by vectors such as mosquitoes, have challenged this view. This project seeks to examine the trade-off hypothesis, an important concept in disease ecology, which suggests that the virulence of a disease is restricted by an evolutionary link with transmission rate.  This project will test this hypothesis by estimating the virulence and transmission rate of parasites of several medically important mosquitoes through modern molecular biology techniques along with traditional ecology modeling methods that will allow an assessment of the success of both host and parasite.\r\n\r\nThis work has broad implications beyond exploring the trade-off hypothesis.  By understanding how virulence has evolved across the lineage of a parasite, valuable insight into mechanisms related to disease virulence can be gained. Further, as mosquitoes are vectors for many human diseases, an increased understanding of the role of parasites of those mosquitoes might assist in future control efforts of host mosquitoes.  Finally, this work will also present a chance to mentor and train undergraduate students in ecological modeling and quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nJohn Soghigian has completed research for his dissertation, \"The Molecular Ecology and Parasitism of Container Dwelling Mosquitoes,\" supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant.   Soghigian\u00c6s research focused on the interaction between a group of parasites that could be used in biocontrol of mosquitoes, and their disease vector hosts, Aedes mosquitoes.  During his funding period, he collected mosquito and parasite samples in Hungary and in the United States, while additional samples were provided by a team of collaborators ranging from academics to mosquito control workers to undergraduate students enrolled in Clark University.  Soghigian wished to explore the relationship between medically important container breeding mosquitoes and gut parasites that infect them.  By assessing co-evolution of host and parasite and then measuring virulence of the parasites, Soghigian hoped to shed light on important questions in disease ecology related to virulence and transmission rate of parasites within hosts.\n\nSoghigian travelled to Hungary and worked with collaborators at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Szeged (HAS).  There, he collected European mosquitoes and amplified DNA from their parasites for the first time.  He also enlisted the aid of collaborators around the country, and trained undergraduates in collection and identification of mosquitoes and parasites.  In one case, Soghigian and another student discovered an undescribed parasite in Colorado mosquito populations. \n\nSoghigian reconstructed the evolutionary history of the mosquito host and this particular parasite, and found that it is possible they have evolved together.  Furthermore, his research into the evolutionary history of mosquitoes should help to resolve lingering issues with scientific names in the medically important Aedes mosquitoes.\n\nSoghigian adapted published macroparasite models to his particular system, and used them to assess the success of a parasite in its host.  These models provide a starting point for future biocontrol efforts, as they allow predictions on the amount of parasites needed to  kill hosts.\n\nTo be completed in early 2016, Soghigian\u00c6s dissertation marks an important contribution to disease and vector ecology.  Furthermore, Soghigian\u00c6s funding allowed the training of many students that can carry on research into this important host and parasite system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Soghigian"
