Specific research applications will include studies of: 1) acid-mine drainage and corrosion affiliated biomineralization processes; 2) geomicrobiological processed in kart environments; and 3) bone apatite biomineralization processes.  The requested XRD will  replace a Phillips 3100 XRPD system that has been in service in The University of Akron?s (UA) Department of Geology and Environmental Science (GES) since 1985 and present safety concerns for student opertion.   The instrument would support research and research training across multiple departments at the University of Akron and would serve as a regional x-ray characterization facility.\r\n\r\n***",
