This project is enhancing students' ability to explore the underlying principles associated with solar technology by developing and providing a mixture of virtual learning materials and hands-on activities, in an attempt to transform the ways that organic physics and optics related courses are currently being offered. The project is enriching electrical and computer engineering capstone project experiences by connecting topics to relevant, compelling challenges in solar energy, while simultaneously introducing students to underlying systems-thinking principles.\r\n\r\nThe project is collecting data to assess the students' reasoning, investigative, and problem-solving skills by analyzing lab reports and poster presentations. The evaluation of student learning outcomes is studying the students' ability to apply their theoretical understanding in real situations. In particular, the project is examining how the use of virtual learning resources can improve a student's ability to perform analysis, conduct testing, interpret results, and solve problems in their hands-on activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE \r\nThe project's focus on solar energy education is helping address the global priority on energy security and the critical shortage of highly qualified scientists and engineers to positively impact the nation and its related economy. The multi-university partnership brings expertise in multiple disciplines of electrical engineering, while also impacting both lower and upper undergraduate level courses. The institutions associated with the project are coordinating and implementing the effort across a diverse set of engineering student populations and locations, increasing the potential for broad exposure and positive impact. \r\n\r\nThe project is creating a scalable model for developing engineering course material that can be adapted for use by a wide range of universities, which are not limited by geography. The collaborative outreach programs of ODU and NSU will also broaden STEM communities by providing: a \"NanoDays\" nanotechnology educational festival; readily adaptable activities for students, teachers, and the general public; summer research programs that focus on underrepresented minority and female students; and demonstrations of solar technologies in a wide variety of elementary schools.",
