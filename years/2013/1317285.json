 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, \"Graduate 10K+,\" an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade. In particular, this project team is focusing on improving preparation and retention in its engineering (electrical, civil, and mechanical) and computer science (CS) departments with a particular emphasis on first-generation students. The PIs are taking a student-centered approach to academic preparation and learning through creation of an integrated institutional network of supports to increase students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging to their major, and belief in the importance of their contributions to society. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its use of several best practices from the STEM education literature that serve as the pillars for the project: (i) a summer intensive preparation program to increase the placement rate of freshmen into Calculus I, (ii) a first-year mathematics supplement added to the gateway Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science course, (iii) enhanced peer and faculty mentoring, and (iv) affinity housing. The project is exercising a broader impact through the expansion of practices that have proven effective at large public institutions and the assessment of such practices. Such an implementation offers a model for many other institutions of similar size and circumstances to adopt. In addition, the high-tech region around the institution is experiencing steady economic growth and the graduates of this program are poised to answer the demands for an increase in the local and regional workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Foundation for STEM Success (FS2) project is a model for STEM student success that uses a student-centered approach to academic preparation and learning, and creates an integrated institutional network of supports that increases students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging to their major, and belief in the importance of their contributions to society.  These are key factors that affect retention in STEM fields.  FS2 was a five-year project that focused on engineering and computer science (CS) majors with the goal of improving retention and graduation rates. \n\nThe FS2 program included four program elements (1) a summer intensive program, (2) a revised gateway course for engineering and CS majors, (3) affinity housing, and (4) a peer and faculty mentor/tutoring program.  Large public institutions piloted these individual program elements, and this project expands their application to a smaller Liberal Arts college setting. \n\nA total of six hundred and four (604) individual undergraduate students participated in this program in five cohorts.  The average cohort size was one hundred and twenty-one (121) and the largest cohort size was one hundred and forty-seven.  On average 18 students participated in the summer bridge program, 61 participated in the affinity housing, 112 participated in the gateway courses and 15 peer mentors were hired each year. \n\nOutcomes of the FS2 project are based on retention data from the first four cohorts of the project and analysis of the five years of assessment surveys and are listed below.\n\nThe FS2 project implemented its main program elements effectively. Evaluation data indicates that the project was able to implement its strategy for each of its four main program elements effectively, expanding the number of ways to engage students in college activities in the process.\nStudents who earn a D, F, or W in a first-year mathematics course are 2.5 times more likely to change out of an engineering or CS major.  \nThe strongest predictors of persistence in these majors is previous academic performance (as measured by the students weighted HS GPA) and mathematics placement.     \n\nStudents with a 3.5 weighted HS GPA have a 39% higher first year retention rate than students with a 2.5 GPA. \nStudents who place into Calculus have a 31% higher first year retention rate than students who place into Pre-Calculus. \n\n\nThe average one-year retention rate was 72%.  While this average rate is below our project goal of 80%, it represents an increase from our baseline of 67%.  \nThe average two-year retention rate is 59%.  This is below our project goal of 71% however, it is an increase from the project baseline of 57%.\nThe project was able to meet the unanticipated challenge of needing to serve many more students than originally anticipated.  While this hampered the project?s ability to meet its retention goals, it helped the project reach its numerical goals.  More importantly, the project adapted well to larger institutional developments beyond its control by maintaining and in some cases improving the quality of its offerings at a larger scale than was originally anticipated.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/16/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc Veletzos"
