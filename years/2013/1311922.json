 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entails the deployment of a two-dimensional (2D) array of GPS scintillation receivers in Calgary Alberta. The deployment of a large number of GPS scintillation receivers over a 2 km region will allow for the investigation of the temporal evolution of the 2D spatial distribution of observed amplitude and phase scintillations.  The 2D time-evolving observations of GPS scintillations will be combined with comprehensive theoretical-numerical 3D forward propagation of electro-magnetic waves through random media, and inverse diffraction tomography techniques to provide quantitative linkage between the observations and analysis of the ground array, and the underlying physics and structuring of the ionospheric irregularities causing the scintillation observations.  Furthermore, data assimilative techniques will be used to estimate large scale gradients in electron density, winds and fields, and compared with the scintillation results and auroral imaging to investigate to what degree knowledge of the large scale background ionosphere improves our understanding of smaller scale structuring.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  The objective of this project was to study and better understand \"turbulent\" structures in the ionosphere.   The ionosphere is the region of Earth's space, where satellites orbit and the space shuttle flies.  We call it the \"ionosphere\" because the Sun's energy knocks electrons off of atoms, making the region charged.  The ionosphere can be understood as being similar to the atmosphere and air at the surface of the earth, only with electrical currents moving through it.\n\n  The turbulent structures we study are similar to what hurricanes and typhoons would be at the surface of the Earth.  The method we use is to study these is called \"GPS scintillations\". GPS is the very same signals you use in your phone to know where you are. Scintillatiions are similar to what you see when you see a star \"twinkle\", only here it is the ionosphere that is twinkling.\n\n  We study these turbulent structures to better understand our overall Earth environment, but also because these twinkling scintillations can negatively effect GPS positioning and related GPS applications.  For this study we used the Scintillation Auroral GPS Array (SAGA) consisting of 7 GPS receivers in a two-dimensiona array on the ground near Fairbanks Alaska.

However, that is very difficult because they are so turbulent and so fast moving. So, instead we try to characterize what the overall shape of the structures is from the observations.  In fact we try to represent the overall shape as an ellipse, and then determine the orientation (direction of the ellipse) and what the long and short axis of the ellipse are. Figure 4 shows one attempt at such a representation for a short 30 second sample of this 40 minute period.  The shown elliptical structure is a ground projection fo what the turbulent structure would look like at ionospheric heights.  \n\nIn summary, this is just an example of..."
