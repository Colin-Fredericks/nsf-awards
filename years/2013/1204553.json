 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, community college students are gaining important experience and business skills and faculty are gaining technical knowledge and skills through a blended approach to internships and externships, combining virtual and hands-on learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project is also focusing on attracting more students, especially female and minority students, to studies and careers in cybersecurity. A new articulation process between the community college and a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) allows university computer science students to take courses at the community college to gain cybersecurity skills and allows community college students to transfer to complete a bachelor's degree. A partnership with a K-12 school system that has a large minority population allows high school students to enroll in community college courses in cybersecurity. The resulting career pathway engages students from diverse backgrounds to enter employment in the cybersecurity field. The project is also developing a cohort approach to assist post-9/11 veterans and dislocated workers in pursuing rapid credentialing to enter cybersecurity careers.\r\n\r\nAlthough cybersecurity technicians need technical skills, they also need to be able to serve as the human interface between the computing system and its business users, including managers and executives who must implement cybersecurity policies. The project is addressing this need by creating new curricula that give students appropriate business skills. Cybersecurity curricula are also being revised and expanded to incorporate the emerging security needs of both standard PC-based systems and high performance computing (HPC) clusters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Cyber Pro: Professional Development Pathways for Students and Faculty in Cybersecurity project produced work of significant intellectual merit and broader impact.  The following summary provides information about key outcomes over the four year period of the grant.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nIntern/Extern Model for Faculty Development\n\n\nA key premise of the grant was that highly effective faculty development could take place by providing learning experiences rather than traditional training seminars or classes for faculty.  Evidence produced by the project definitely supports this premise&mdash;both college and high school faculty report that their extern experiences provided significant increases in their technical skills; their knowledge of challenges faced by business and government in managing cybersecurity; and their understanding of the need to adjust teaching methods to include important cybersecurity challenges.  \n\n 2. Dual high school and college credit programs in cybersecurity\n\nMost high schools are have little room in their curriculum for elective courses and instead focus on mathematics, science, English and courses to meet high school graduation requirements.  Convincing high schools to add cybersecurity and related Information Technology courses to the curriculum is a major challenge but it was achieved through this grant.  The process used for that achievement, its benefits, and how it can be accomplished by other high schools and community colleges is of high intellectual merit and has been documented and shared broadly with high school and college officials nationwide.  A summary of the process is attached to this report.\n\n 3. Virtual Internship Model\n\nWhile many major corporations allow employees to work virtually from home or other locations and almost all colleges and universities use virtual or online learning courses, there have been few efforts to create \"virtual internships.\"  The model used in this project is of broad intellectual interest since it allows small community colleges, whose students would not typically be able to access learning available at major research facilities or in distant corporate organizations, to provide access to internships and employment experiences which would otherwise be unavailable using virtual technology.

The model is of intellectual merit for possible replication at other colleges in cybersecurity, high performance computing and also in other fields.  \n\n 4. Student/Faculty Development of Teaching Modules\n\nA team of faculty externs and student interns undertook the challenge of creating laboratory teaching modules for use in high school and college cybersecurity courses.  This approach was unique because it used students and faculty working together to incorporate real world cybersecurity challenges into existing curriculum.  \n\nBroader impact:\n\nCAE2Y impact\n\n\nThe work done to become a two year Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE2Y) produced a broader impact for the region.  The program resulted in outreach to the community providing citizens and businesses with specific measures they can take to improve their personal and corporate cybersecurity.  Further the CAE2Y process will continue to assist community college students to be able to enroll in advanced work at four year institutions and have their cybersecurity degree credits transfer and apply towards a higher degree.\n\n 2. Impact of Research Projects\n\nThe summer internship projects were identified by industry as cybersecurity topics which needed detailed investigation, analysis, and research.
