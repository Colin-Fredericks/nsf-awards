 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is structured around a novel conceptual framework for how nitrogen (N) cycling in boreal bogs changes as a function of both time-since-fire and experimentally augmented N.  Bog sites of different ages (time since the most recent fire) will receive elevated N inputs in simulated rainfall.  New insights will be gained into: the importance of biological N2-fixation as a newly recognized major input of N into these bogs; the role of Sphagnum mosses, which cover the bog surface and are the major contributors to ongoing peat accumulation, as the gatekeepers of newly acquired N from either N2-fixation or rain and snow; and the linkages between N inputs and the ability of bogs to sequester both N and carbon (C) in the accumulating peat.\r\n\r\nBoreal peatlands cover only 3-4% of the Earth's land surface, yet store 25-30% of the world's soil C and 9-16% of the world's soil N in peat.  Peatlands represent an ongoing net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Bogs of western Canada persist at the dry end of the climatic gradient across which peatlands exist, and hence are especially sensitive to ongoing climate changes that include increasing temperature, as well as increasing wildfire frequency and severity.  Further, in western Canada, atmospheric N deposition historically has been low, but is increasing because of N emissions from oil sands development in northern Alberta.   Clarifying the linkages between N and C cycling in western Canadian bogs will enhance the ability to predict how N and C storage in peat may be influenced by ongoing climate change.  The research will support graduate and undergraduate thesis students; the PIs will teach a Peatland Ecology course at the Meanook Biological Research Station, Alberta, Canada, in years 2 and 4 of the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPeatlands, bogs and fens, cover 365,157 km2 of northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Canada.  Bogs are acidic, Sphagnum moss-dominated peatlands, and are thought to be ombrotrophic, meaning that they receive inputs of water and new nutrients solely via atmospheric deposition.  Besides Sphagnum mosses, ericaceous shrub species and black spruce (Picea mariana) are found in Alberta bogs.  While bogs in general function as substantial sinks for atmospheric CO2 (fixed by photosynthesis and stored as accumulating peat), these bogs are subject to two major disturbances.  Bogs burn in wildfires about every 100 years.  The frequency and intensity of wildfires in boreal continental western Canada are expected to increase with ongoing climate change.  In addition, although these bogs have persisted where background atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is quite low, in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, N deposition has been increasing regionally as a consequence of ongoing oil sands development.  After wildfire, bogs function as a net source of atmospheric CO2, as peat decomposes and plant photosynthesis is negligible, but over time, these bogs regain their CO2 sink function.  By experimentally applying rainfall of different N contents to five bogs ranging from 2 to 103 years since the most recent wildfire, we examined how increasing atmospheric N deposition affects bog carbon and nitrogen cycling after fire.  We verified our recent finding that biological N2 fixation (bacterial conversion of atmospheric N2 to organic N) is the major source of new N to Alberta bogs, not atmospheric deposition.  Although N2 fixation is low after fire, it increases over time.  However, experimentally increasing N deposition inhibits biological N2 fixation.  Increasing N deposition had no effect on annual net primary production of Sphagnum mosses or on rates of ecosystem respiration (CO2 production from peat decomposition and from live plant respiration), but stimulated production of short-statured ericaceous shrubs.  The net effect was that adding N shortened the time required bog to return to a net CO2 sink function after fire and generally strengthened the bog CO2 sink strength.  However, it may be that a consequence of the stimulation of shrub growth over a longer period of time could be shading out of the Sphagnum mosses, thereby greatly compromising the current net CO2 sink strength of these bogs.  Understanding how changing wildfire regimes and increasing atmospheric N deposition affects carbon and nitrogen cycling in boreal bogs is critical to predicting how the boreal bog net CO2 sink function may change with ongoing climate change and oil sands development.\n\nEducation and training of students was one of the project goals.  This project supported the Masters thesis research of four women, three of which are now employed in environmental positions, one of which is in a doctoral program.  Nine (7 women; one underrepresented group) undergraduate students spent field seasons in Alberta assisting in all aspects of data collection and/or worked as laboratory assistants during academic years.  At various times during the project, four women were supported as Research Technicians.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R. Kelman Wieder"
