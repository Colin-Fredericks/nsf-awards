 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chicago Zoological Society (CZS) in collaboration with Eden Place Nature Center, the Fuller Park Community Corporation, and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) will implement the SCIENCES Program, Supporting a Community's Informal Education Needs:  Confidence and Empowerment in STEM. The primary goals of this Full Scale Development project are to broaden access to and participation in environmental science, strengthen partnerships between CZS, Eden Place, and UIC, and gain insights into the 'ecosystemic' learning model which promotes scientific literacy and agency in the community. The project targets a low-resource community with a minority audience while the secondary audience is informal science learning organizations and researchers who will advance research in informal learning. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical framework for the project design draws on conservation psychology, informal science learning, civic ecology education, and urban science education to create an ecosystematic, geographically centered approach. The deliverables include research, curriculum, and engaging hands-on programs for youth, families, adults, and teachers, reaching both in-school and out-of-school audiences, in addition to the SCIENCES Implementation Network. Three potential curriculum themes to be explored are water conservation and protection, pollinators for healthy ecosystems, and community resilience to climate change. The SCIENCES project offers a comprehensive suite of engaging programs for community audiences. For example, the year-long Zoo Adventure Passport (ZAP) program for families includes hands-on experiments and field trips, while project-based learning experiences enable teens to create wetlands, design interpretive signage, and develop associated public programming. School-based programs include professional development for teachers on the Great Lakes ecosystem and invasive species. Existing programs that have been previously evaluated and demonstrated to show learning impacts will be adapted and modified to meet the goals of the ecosystemic learning model by providing multiple learning opportunities. New learning resources will also be created to support the content themes and provide continuity. The result will be a comprehensive approach that ensures deep community engagement by individuals, families, and organizations, with cohesiveness provided by the overarching content themes which broaden access to STEM learning resources and leverages partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe project includes both a research and evaluation plan. The primary research question to be addressed is:  How does a large informal science learning institution work with a community-based organization to support environmental scientific literacy and agency at all levels of the community? A sociocultural framework will be used for this mixed-methods case study research. Study participants include community leaders, youth, parents, teachers, and staff from Eden Place. The case study sample will include 20 focal individuals drawn from the participant groups and approximately 300 survey participants. Case study data will be triangulated with evaluation data and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. By examining changes from the baseline following the implementation of the community programs, the findings may provide insight on agency and science literacy among community members.  The comprehensive, mixed-methods evaluation plan employs a quasi-experimental design and incorporates front-end, formative, and summative evaluation components. The evaluation questions address the quality of the processes and products, access to environmental science learning opportunities, environmental science literacy, sustainability, and barriers to implementation. \r\n\r\nAn extensive dissemination plan is proposed with a dual emphasis on meeting stakeholders' needs at multiple levels.  The evaluation and research teams will emphasize publication in peer reviewed journals and presentations at conferences for informal science education professionals. Findings will be shared with the Fuller Park community stakeholders using creative methods such as one-page research briefs written in layperson's language, videos, and recorded interviews with participants. The local project Advisory Board will also be actively involved in the dissemination of findings to community constituents. The SCIENCES National Amplification Network will be created and work collaboratively with the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Metropolitan Green Spaces Alliance to disseminate the model. Collectively, the activities and deliverables outlined in this proposal will advance the discovery of sustainable models of community-based learning while the research will advance the understanding of informal learning support for science literacy and agency.",

University of Illinois at Chicago (www.uic.edu) led the research component and ExposeYourMuseum, LLC (www.exposeyourmuseum.com) conducted project evaluation.</p>\n<p>The project vision was to support environmental conservation and lifelong learning through broadening participation and access to relevant science learning programs within a community with a population underrepresented in STEM. SCIENCES offered community-focused education programs for public, student, and professional audiences in Fuller Park and surrounding neighborhoods. The project approach leveraged Eden Place and Chicago Zoological Society assets, including Eden Place's position as a community resource for learning and nature-based experiences with a local perspective and CZS' decades of community outreach and education program experience. The project employed a holistic model with multiple STEM education touch points across a variety of ages, audiences, and program types.</p>\n<p>Eden Place Nature Center, a former dump site transformed through community action, is located in Fuller Park, a less than one-square-mile region with about 2,500 residents, approximately 90% of whom are African American, and about half living below poverty level. Fuller Park has high unemployment and crime rates, and with the exception of a few families, it is a transient neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Following a one-year planning and networking period, SCIENCES offered three years of education programs, aligned by annual themes: \"Pollinators and Native Gardens,\" \"Fuller Park Water: A Shared Resource for Healthy People, Plants, and Animals,\" and \"Nutrition and Sustainability.\" A synthesis and dissemination period followed the education program implementation phase. Education programs continued after the three-year SCIENCES education program phase through other sources of funding, maintaining Chicago Zoological Society's commitment to community programming.</p>\n<p>SCIENCES attendance at approximately 90 education programs (2014-2017) totaled over 3,800. Programs included approximately 10 educator workshops for professional audiences attended by about 160; about 30 programs for student audiences' school group classes, field trips, and the King Conservation Science Scholars teen volunteer program--attended by around 950 participants; and approximately 48 public programs including camp, youth programs, festivals, and community conservation action events attended by about 2,700. Attendance numbers include repeat participants. Education programs took place on site at Eden Place Nature Center, and included visits to the local public library, as well as field trips to area nature-based facilities and to Brookfield Zoo.</p>\n<p>Participants reported through project evaluation increased connection to the environment and comfort with science, and many planned to undertake environmental stewardship activities. Participants indicated programs were a good way to connect with the community.</p>\n<p>In addition, project partners have reflected upon the complexity of a community-focused STEM learning project. Reflections include the strong value of consistency in the availability of education programs and ongoing presence of education and community relations staff members from Chicago Zoological Society at Eden Place and in Fuller Park, in general. Attendance at education programs was supported by both word-of-mouth across community participants and persistent networking and relationship-building through CZS community-relations staff dedicated full-time to the project. Another lesson learned through the SCIENCES project was the strong need to be adaptive and responsive in community-focused education program design and implementation. SCIENCES built upon Chicago Zoological Society's prior suite of education programs that had been carried out in other Chicago city neighborhoods, largely in marginalized communities and primarily in indoor settings such as local libraries. It was necessary to adapt the structure and function of each discrete program in order to be most relevant to the Fuller Park community. Adaptations included program timing, such as holding sessions closer together in time in order to maintain momentum with participants, and education program content, such as drawing on opportunities to use the outdoor space at EPNC to connect to locally-relevant environmental conservation themes. Additional reflections were noted in a 2017 CAISE Project Spotlight article (https://www.informalscience.org/news-views/sciences-supporting-community%E2%80%99s-informal-education-needs-confidence-and-empowerment-stem).</p>\n<p>In addition to education programs described above, about 90 community members participated in interactive conversation and celebration events (2017 and 2018) where reflections on the SCIENCES project, community strengths and struggles, and Fuller Park community and Eden Place and Chicago Zoological Society assets were discussed. A culminating event recognizing the participation of community members in SCIENCES programs was attended by approximately 160 in 2019. The 2019 event also marked the release of \"The Nature of Community,\" a booklet about the SCIENCES project, which describes the project, partners, lessons learned and reflections, and participant and project team perspectives.
