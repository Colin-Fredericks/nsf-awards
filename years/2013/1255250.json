 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richard Feynman famously challenged scientists and engineers to extend the engineering dominion over biology. While there is progress in this area, the reality for major achievements remains largely only a vision. Biological assembly exemplifies mastery over many molecular scales, from small-molecule nutrients to macromolecular proteins and genes, extending to still higher scales of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane. Synthetic control at these molecular scales has remained out of reach, but the microfluidic fruits of Feynman's challenges in systems miniaturization are poised to unravel the complexities of membrane assembly. This technology has led to the building of organized bilayer structures with cellular architecture that are capable of Darwinian evolution. This project explores layer-by-layer assembly as a route to synthetic cells that are programmable in terms of size, concentration of contents, and membrane chemical characteristics such as lipid compositional asymmetry and lamellarity, which are hallmarks of cellular architecture. The resultant ordered arrays of trapped cells will provide a platform for membrane prototyping, enabling the discovery and characterization of entirely novel membrane compositions and membranes composed of primitive materials that may have been present on the early Earth. \r\n\r\nBiology is rich in complex behavior that will drive the most important scientific discoveries of this century. For many, this complexity can impede thinking rationally about its function, diversity and adaptation, and thereby impede further economic and technological development. The proposed research unifies synthetic control at the molecular scale with behavior at the cellular scale. Understanding and appreciating this unity is key to demystifying biological complexity and evolution by demonstrating the chemical basis of life on earth. To achieve these goals, the PI has developed educational activities that teach the scale relationship between atoms, molecules, and cells. Closely mentored high school and undergraduate summer interns will have the opportunity to control with their hands the formation of cellular structures through one-on-one interactions as investments in the nation's future scientific and economic enterprise. Palm Beach County middle and high school science teachers will be offered a professional development workshop to become proficient in this area to impact a large student population through instrumentation and curricula that connect the elegance of chemistry with the complexity of biological function and organization.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is being funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division and is being co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry (CHE) Division.",

However, this work serendipitously resulted in a design that was effective at incubating thousands of microscopic, cell-like water-in-oil droplets. Droplets are loaded with various cargoes that approximate cellular processes, such as enzymatic action or mRNA translation &mdash; the fundamental process by which cells synthesize the proteins encoded by their DNA. Droplets travel to a chamber that extracts the oil separating the droplets, causing them to close-pack &mdash; a process called emulsion &ldquo;creaming&rdquo; &mdash; and incubate in flow for a uniform period of time. This integrated, continuous emulsion creamer (ICEcreamer) incubator ended up being highly advantageous as an incubator design for these biochemical processes, and we published this work in 2017 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03070).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Carrying forward the idea of synthetic cells, the incubator was then added as a component to a larger microfluidic architecture used in the laboratory to screen a miniaturized compound collection for small molecules that affect the reaction in each droplet. Once the microchip identifies such a droplet, it sorts the droplet into a collection tube for further analysis. The ICEcreamer incubator was used to screen a library of small molecules containing a very basic enzymatic reaction. ~30 novel active chemical structures were discovered. The enzyme, autotaxin (ATX), is involved in processing components of the cell membrane that affect cell growth. Inhibition of ATX is thought to be important in the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agents. The implementation of this new reaction incubation circuit component and subsequent molecular discoveries are the subject of a manuscript in preparation that is nearing completion.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once the ICEcreamer incubator was shown to work with a simple enzymatic reaction, we sought to demonstrate its utility in generating, incubating and screening droplets containing a bacterial translation reaction. These droplets are even closer to synthetic cellular entities and model the fundamental process (translation) that many antibiotics inhibit as a method of treating bacterial infections. The circuit was used to screen the compound library for small molecules that disrupted bacterial translation. Again, ~20 compounds were identified that efficiently inhibit this core bacterial process. Five of these 20 have validated as highly active species and we are now in the process of determining exactly how these compounds inhibit bacterial translation and whether they kill bacteria. A manuscript describing these new and exciting results is coalescing. Both the enzyme and bacterial translation papers were uniquely enabled by the invention of the ICEcreamer incubator; this has been a highly fruitful avenue of research and will broadly impact small molecule discovery!</span></p>\n<p><strong>Droplet Interface Bilayers</strong></p>\n<p><span>We have been exploring a microfluidic circuit that creates thousands of flowing droplet pairs. The junction between pairs simulates a cell membrane and is called a droplet interface bilayer (DIB). DIB chip engineering has been complicated. During the last project period we have discovered that using a single phospholipid to stabilize the droplets for DIB formation is not reproducible; pairs seem to coalesce depending on lipid sample prep. Further investigation of this device and chemistry is ongoing. We believe that a solution is to be found in using not pure lipid, but mixtures of different lipids. This has been shown to be critical in the development of prebiotically plausible membranes formed by processes similar to those of the DIB chip.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Impact Through Outreach</strong></p>\n<p><span>We executed a fourth hands-on digital microscopy workshop on the Scripps Research-Florida campus (24&ndash;26 JUL 2017).
