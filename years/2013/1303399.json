 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Workshop on High Dimensional Topology\" will be held at the University of Notre Dame on December 7 and 8, 2012.  The core problem in high dimensional topology is the classification of manifolds through the technique of surgery theory.   This involves techniques from a wide spectrum of mathematics, including algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, analysis, and geometric group theory.    A key theme is topological rigidity, especially the Borel conjecture and related topics such as equivariant rigidity and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature cutting-edge lectures from mathematicians in the field.   One of the talks in the conference will survey the work of Frank Connolly, one of the leading experts in the field.  There have been several conferences recently in Europe on high dimensional topology, but a conspicuous lack of domestic conferences.  The workshop will give the opportunity for professional mathematicians and graduate studies to discuss current developments.\r\n\r\nThe conference website can be found at\r\nhttp://mypage.iu.edu/~qkhan/conference/",
