Tuscaloosa\r\nTitle: \tMRI/Dev.: Robot-aided, Cognitive Virtual Rehabilitation for Automatic Physical Training of \r\n\t\t\t\tIndividuals with Disabilities (iRAPID) \r\nProject Proposed:\r\nThis project, developing iRAPID, a robot-aided cognitive virtual rehabilitation instrument for automatic physical training of individuals with disabilities, integrates several hardware components (the KineAssist robot, programmable treadmill, biomarkers (sensors) and Xbox kinect sensors) to build an augmented virtual reality animation of the patient. A series of newly developed software tools will support virtual rehab research computations of body balancing and neuro-pattern changes during rehab.\r\nThe instrument will be designed to be suitable for three different cost/performance levels, with successive levels making use of more comprehensive sensors. Combining the sensors (e.g., functional NearInfraRed and EEG brain imaging) with physical rehab mechanisms (e.e., treadmill) make possible interesting research areas related to the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation training. Hence, iRAPID will be a cognitive, research-oriented rehab instrument with automatic, accurate rehab training progress computation.  To enable the stated goals, the system should be capable of recording a wealth of sensor measurements. Advancing the next-generation  rehab system, the work\r\n-\tAdopts a hierarchical (3 layers), incremental (3 modes) development strategy,\r\n-\tSupports computational rehabilitation research, and\r\n-\tAdopts evolution-oriented software design.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe instrumentation enables research an education of an exciting new field, Cognitive ElectroBiomedical Systems (CEBS), enables the training in CEEBS of two PhD students, and outreach to minorities. CEBS is a trans-disciplinary (TrD) field has distinguished features compared to multi-disciplinary (MuD) and inter-disciplinary (InD). The authors compare these fields to a cake where different ingredients are not easily distinguishable (TrD) giving a new format product,  and a plate of salad that still has clear existence of different ingredients ((InD).  The PhD training program will have a training structure  included TrD/MuD/InD curriculum and service learning. The Director of Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) will assist in involving underrepresented students with summer CAMP and K-12 activities. This development is likely to highly contribute within an EPSCoR jurisdiction.",

(1) The iRAPID provides significant new capabilities that are not available from an instrument provided by a vendor: First, none of the existing vendors can provide such an integrated hardware system with seamless inter-operations among the co-robot (KineAssist), treadmill, wireless sensors, and VR units. Second, we are the first team to build a series of software tools to support virtual rehab research with accurate, automatic computation of body balancing levels and neuro-pattern changes during rehab. (2) This iRAPID instrument, which has been successfully developed, has enabled the research and education of an exciting new field - called Cognitive ElectroBiomedical Systems (CEBS). Just like a revolutionary field proposed two decades ago - microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), CEBS is also a transdisciplinary (TrD) field which has distinguished features compared to multi-disciplinary (MuD) and inter-disciplinary (InD) fields.
