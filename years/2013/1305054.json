This proposal explores\r\nsome fundamental issues in integer feasibility checking and certification for \r\na specialized class of constraints called Unit Two Variable Per Inequality \r\n(UTVPI) constraints. This approach is based on fundamentally new insights into \r\nthe problem of integer feasibility checking, and will provide actual certificates \r\nof infeasibility. The ability to provide positive and negative certificates \r\nwill impact program verification, and enhance the reliability of software.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a proof system called FMR (Fourier-Motzkin with Rounding), which \r\nis a sound and complete system for establishing the lattice point infeasibility of \r\na UTVPI system. This work will isolate the smallest-sized proof of infeasibility \r\nin the FMR proof system with an appropriately defined notion of size, and will explore \r\nthe problem of certification by trying to identify the form of certificates and \r\noptimize the size of such certificates.",
