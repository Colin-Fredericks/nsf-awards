 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks to further our basic physical understanding of severe convective storms and tornadoes, with an emphasis on tornadoes produced by supercells. The overall goal will be accomplished through the analysis of data collected by state-of-the-art mobile Doppler radars and a mobile Doppler lidar (TWOLF: Truck-Mounted Wind Observing Lidar Facility). The former include: 1) a rapid-scan (mechanically scanning), polarimetric, X-band radar (RaXPol); 2) a rapid-scan, phasedarray, X-band radar (MWR-05XP); and 3) a high-resolution, W-band radar (University of Massachusetts-Amherst's W-band radar).\r\n\r\nSome of the radar data to be analyzed includes datasets collected during VORTEX2 (The 2nd Verification of the Origin of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment) in the springs of 2009 and 2010.  The remainder of the radar data to be analyzed include RaXPol and MWR-05XP data collected a during a small, local, field program during the spring of 2011, RaXPol data collected during the spring of 2012, RaXPol and TWOLF/MWR 05XP data collected during the spring of 2013, and RaXPol data collected during the springs of 2014 and 2015.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nUsing the rapid-scan radars, the evolution of vortex signatures in time and space will be explored in both supercells that produce tornadoes and those that do not. This information can be used to help assess the mechanism(s) of tornado formation. The polarimetric radar will be used to infer information about microphysical processes within supercells and how they might relate to storm structure and evolution, and tornado formation. The high-resolution W-band radar data already collected during VORTEX2 will be further analyzed to document the fine-scale structure of tornadoes and tornado-like vortices. TWOLF will be used mainly to measure the vertical variation in winds in and near tornadoes and mesocyclones in the lowest 100 m, an undertaking, owing to ground clutter contamination, that is difficult with radars and is extremely challenging by in-situ probing. Very little is known about the boundary layer in tornadoes or under storms when they form. The character of the boundary layer is thought to be a very important factor in determining the potential intensity of intense vortices such as tornadoes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nIt is anticipated that forecasts and warnings of tornadoes and other severe weather phenomena such as large hail and straight-line winds will be improved with an increase in a physical understanding of them. The results from this project may be useful to the National Weather Service and private forecasting companies, and could help mitigate property damage and save lives. Graduate students will be trained and become part of the pool of the next-generation of researchers.",

To accomplish this task, my graduate students and I, supported by this grant, conducted field programs in the springs of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, during which detailed datasets were collected in the Plains of the U. S. for tornadoes and their parent storms using a mobile, rapid-scan, polarimetric Doppler radar and, during 2015 only, using a mobile Doppler lidar. The significance of the former is that the wind and precipitation fields and the nature of the precipitation were measured at short time intervals commensurate with the rapid formation and evolution typical of tornadoes. The significance of the latter is that fine-scale profiles of the wind near the ground near tornadoes could be obtained, something that has hitherto not been attempted and is very difficult or impossible to do with radars. Data collected during these field experiments and data collected during VORTEX-2 (the second Verification of the Origin of Tornadoes Experiment), in 2009 and 2010, were analyzed. In particular, the evolution and structure of tornadoes were documented for a major outbreak near El Reno, Oklahoma on 31 May 2013 and for a number of other tornadoes. It was found that tornadoes in some supercells begin near the surface after a mesocyclone (a cyclone around 2 &ndash; 5 km across) about 1 &ndash; 2 km above the ground forms. It was also found that very high wind speeds can occur in tornadoes just above the ground (as high as 300 m s<sup>-1 </sup>or greater), but may not be evident without Doppler-radar documentation when the surface does not contain any structures that can be damaged, such as an open field. Also, the structure and motion of multiple vortices within a tornadoe were analyzed in unprecedented detail; it was found that the individual vortices begin and end in preferred quadrants of their parent circulation. Anticyclonic tornadoes, which are relatively rare, were also documented and analyzed. Several of the graduate students who were at least in part funded by this grant have earned Ph. D. and/or M. S. degrees in meteorology and have gone to teach at other universities, one has gone on to work as a forecaster for the National Weather Service, and another completed his M. S. thesis research and is currently working on his Ph. D. One of the students was a woman; women are underrepresented in meteorology. In summary, there were important scientific findings regarding tornadoes and their parent storms, which will improve our ability to forecast them and their effects; members of the next generation of researchers, educators, and forecasters have been trained. Our research was highlighted in the media nationally and internationally, thus giving the public a look at how science progresses and possibly inspiring young students to consider becoming meteorologists, Finally, a new mobile radar and lidar were tested in the field and used to further our knowledge of tornadoes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Howard&nbsp;B&nbsp;Bluestein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262048/1262048_10241585_1499376555223_053113.231220z--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262048/1262048_10241585_1499376555223_053113.231220z--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Radar reflectivity in a tornadic supercell\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1262048/1262048_10241585_1499376555223_053113.231220z--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Radar reflectivity in a tornadic supercell\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image from the tornadic supercell that hit El Reno, Oklahoma on 31 May 2013, was made using RaXPol, a mobile, rapid-scan, polarimetric radars funded by NSF.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard B.
