 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial-mineral interactions are ubiquitous and crucial aspects of geochemical cycling at the Earth's surface. Significant progress has been made towards identifying how specific groups of microorganisms interact with minerals, especially Fe oxides. However, there has been little work on how microbes make and break elemental sulfur (S(0)), though geologists have postulated microbial involvement in producing economic S(0) deposits. Chemical and biological controls on this process are not well understood, and will require a better understanding of factors affecting S(0) production and consumption within microbial biofilms.\r\n\r\nSulfur-cycling in the deep subsurface Frasassi cave system has been the target of several previous investigations due to its unique biogeochemistry and relative accessibility to human exploration. The cave ecosystem is sustained by microbial chemosynthesis taking place near the surface of its perenially sulfidic and microoxic aquifer. Conspicuous white biofilms in the cave waters contain 20 to 80% elemental sulfur by mass. Thus its geochemical and microbiological features make Frasassi a promising system for investigating microbial interactions with S(0), an important solid-phase intermediate in the sulfur cycle. Enigmatic Epsilonproteobacteria from the globally distributed and largely uncultivated Sulfurovumales clade are major players in Frassasi biofilms. They are especially abundant in waters with high sulfide and low oxygen supply, conditions which should lead to S(0) accumulation due to limited availability of electron acceptors. Using Frasassi biofilms and enrichment cultures as a model system, investigators are combining metatranscriptomics, correlative electron microscopy, and geochemistry with field and laboratory experiments to develop new understanding of S(0)-accumulating biofilm communities. This research will improve understanding of (i) the microbial role in producing geologic S(0) deposits; (ii) mechanisms for microbial interactions with solid phase S(0); and (iii) the metabolic capabilities of currently uncultured Epsilonproteobacteria. The research supports the long-term goal of integrating genetic and geochemical understanding of modern and ancient S biogeochemistry.\r\n\r\nProject funds provide for the mentoring of two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The proposed project provides outstanding opportunities for outreach to the general public due to interest in caves and extreme microbes. Images and microbial cultures from the project will be utilized in two highly successful annual events: PSU Exploration Day and PSU Geosciences Dept. \"Shake, Rattle, Rocks\". These events reach more than 2000 K-12 students and parents last year and 150 third grade students. Project microslide cultures will be incorporated into a hands-on grade 6-12 teacher workshop and the College of Earth, Ocean and Environment's annual Coast Day on the Lewes campus, a 34-year tradition that now attracts thousands of community members. Results will also be shared as part of the DE Sea Grant At Sea newsletter, and Sea Talk radio segments on NPR.",

Scientists have made good progress identifying how microbes interact with some minerals, for example apatite in bones or iron metal alloys in infrastructure, but many other important minerals have been overlooked. Solid elemental sulfur deposits, which originate from fluids mixing beneath the earth's surface, have been mined economically for several centuries. The overarching goal of our project was to learn how and when microbes produce and consume solid sulfur. Solid sulfur is insoluble and water-repelling, and therefore poses a potential challenge for microbial cells that could potentially process it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since solid sulfur is a central intermediate in the sulfur cycle, we designed this project to help us better predict the speed and extent of sulfur transformations, both on the present earth and in the deep geologic past when sulfur played an even more crucial role in our planet's chemical balance with respect to oxygen. In collaboration with our colleagues at the University of Delaware, we used tools including environmental microbiomes, fluorescence and electron microscopy, and x-ray spectroscopy to examine natural microbial communities living in a sulfur-rich aquifer. Deep underground (&gt; 500 meters), the aquifer intersects a cave accessible to human exploration. The cave provides a rare window for us to study processes occurring below the earth's surface that are otherwise hidden from view.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We learned that in the aquifer, competing microbial processes are simultaneously creating and destroying solid sulfur. Production is enhanced when oxygen is consistently present at low concentrations. Under these conditions, microbes can only partially burn hydrogen sulfide, resulting in solid elemental sulfur as a waste product rather than more completely burned (oxidized) products such as sulfate ions. Solid sulfur destruction under these conditions cannot keep up with production, and appears to occur by a poorly understood microbial pathway known as ?disproportionation?. &nbsp;Microbes carrying out disproportionation gain relatively &nbsp;small amounts of energy from each sulfur atom. As a result, they can be quickly replaced by microbes carrying out more energetically favorable sulfur transformations if oxygen availability increases. In this case, solid sulfur is more rapidly destroyed and does not accumulate in the environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We learned in a prior project that sulfur producing microorganisms are sensitive to tiny (5-10 micromoles per liter) changes in the concentration of oxygen around them. In this project we learned that the greatest sulfur accumulations are associated with microbial species that prefer very high sulfide:oxygen ratios, so that we can now predict which species are the most efficient solid sulfur producers and what conditions they prefer for best growth. We can use this information to develop more efficient reactors to remove and recover sulfur in wastewater coming from sewage, mining, and leather tanning industries on earth, and in wastewater recovery reactors designed to support human space exploration. The recovered sulfur has a variety of important industrial uses including battery construction and acid generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to potential biotechnology and industrial applications, our new knowledge of how microbes make and break solid sulfur in nature can be used as input for better numerical models of sulfur cycling on present-day and ancient earth. The DNA sequence data that we contributed to public databases as part of this project will feed future studies of sulfur-rich microbial communites, including those found in industrial and hydrothermal vent settings, and contributes to our emerging understanding of how sulfur cycling microbes and their enzymes evolved billions of years ago.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project provided training for 5 &nbsp;graduate students (3 female, 1 hispanic) and a female postdoctoral researcher. Two of the students obtained M.S. degrees and went into industry jobs in their chosen subfields. A third M.S. student is continuing in her field as a Ph.D. student at another university. The fourth and fifth students obtained doctoral degrees and successfully secured jobs in academia or industry. The postdoctoral researcher obtained a permanent academic position and is now a professor with a research group of her own at a large U.S. university. We published 7 peer-reviewed journal articles, with several more in final stages of preparation for review.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also inspired a segment of the award-winning documentary film The Most Unknown, which is available on Netflix.
