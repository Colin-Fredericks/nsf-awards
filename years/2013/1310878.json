 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traits that influence reproductive success can be both remarkably elaborate and differ greatly between related species. Variation in such traits not only influences an individual?s success in populations, but can also help form new species when groups differ in characteristics important to choosing a mate. Measuring reproductive success becomes more complex when animals mate with multiple individuals within a single breeding cycle, a common occurrence. Reproductive success, a major influence on trait evolution, is then shaped not only by success in achieving matings, but also by competitively fertilizing eggs, and producing high quality offspring. Using lines of flour beetles whose males? produce sperm with red or green fluorescent tagged heads, this research will evaluate the outcome of these different selective episodes and identify their contribution to reproductive success. The use of the fluorescent sperm lines also enables identification of mechanisms underlying differences in competitive fertilization success within populations, as well as differences in fertilization capability in hybrid versus same species matings. Finally, this research will explore how repeated matings influence offspring production in this highly promiscuous species.\r\n\r\nBecause flour beetles are economically significant stored grain pests, insight to their reproductive system can inform management efforts. Additionally, the project will include involvement of multiple undergraduate researchers and outreach to the Syracuse City School District.",
