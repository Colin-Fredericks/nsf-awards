 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in STEM fields need exposure to research and project experience tying together the elements of STEM - fundamentally based in science and math, using technology tools to achieve engineering solutions - in a context demonstrating societal impact.  The growing area of biomedical engineering provides an appropriate and effective framework in which to implement a high-impact undergraduate research program addressing this need.  Leveraging an existing research strength in the area of biomedical device technologies, a three-year REU program (summer site) supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers will focus on providing an intensive research experience in biomedical devices for undergraduate students.  With a focus on biomedical devices, the project topics include robotics, medical tool design, implanted devices, imaging, tissue engineering, and so forth.  This proposed research is classified as an institutional priority area and is seen as a growth area for scientific and technological discovery.  The objectives are to: 1) provide interdisciplinary research experiences to undergraduate students in the area of biomedical devices, with 50% of the program participants being underrepresented minorities and/or students from institutions with limited research programs; 2) foster participants' skills in becoming independent researchers; 3) provide participants with a broader view of research and development activities in academia and industry; and 4) expand participants' skills and knowledge in entrepreneurship and other areas of professional development.  Some of the anticipated outcomes are: 1) stimulate career interest in biomedical engineering and related STEM fields; 2) improve participants' understanding of the role of research and development in the commercial sector and its relation to national interests; and 3) stimulate interest in commercialization of ideas and technology.  Research results and educational outcomes will be published with students as lead or co-authors.  This balanced and diverse summer experience will influence the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers to make substantial contributions in their future careers.",
