 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIowa Lakes Community College's Infinity Scholars program is designed to unify a diverse group of talented STEM students with academic preparation for a successful transition to a university or the workforce.  Each year, up to 30 scholarship recipients are to engage in career exploration conferences, undergraduate research with a capstone event featuring participant research, professional portfolio development, membership in the Iowa Academy of Science, and a STEM Exploration Trip.  Additionally, faculty mentoring and cohort study table activities are planned to increase student retention to degree achievement.  At graduation, Iowa Lakes' Infinity Scholars are well-prepared to become leaders and innovators in technical areas of national need.\r\n  \r\nIntellectual Merit: The program builds upon Iowa Lakes' first S-STEM program in which 144 participants maintained an average GPA of 3.50, well above the college average of 2.76.  Experienced Principal Investigators plan to expand this success through the addition of more intensive career exploration, participation in goal-focused cohorts, and professional networking. The Infinity Scholars program success is to be measured against eligible, non-participant student baseline data for Iowa Lakes and STEM degree programs in a project database.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The Infinity Scholars program is to advance learning and discovery through participant travel, professional networking, and opportunities for undergraduate research.  Iowa Lakes' designation as the Northwest Iowa STEM Hub is to allow program information to be quickly disseminated to gifted students throughout the region and the state, and will be an effective means for recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups.",
