 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Innovation Institute: From Problem to Product (I2) takes high school students through the entire process of inventing a device, software or other technology. This proposal makes use of a Makerspace at the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), which is located in a community with a high proportion of both immigrant and low-income residents. I2 builds on NYSCI experience with the Maker movement and leverages its Explainer program (where high school students who work as exhibit or program facilitators) by providing: 1) a product prototype/design program for high school Explainers and 2) afterschool and Saturday activities for middle school students, with mentoring provided by the Explainers. It will serve a total of 60 high school students (20 in each cohort) and 1000 elementary and middle school students. \r\n\r\nUsing a quasi-experimental design, the project evaluation addresses these questions: \r\n1. Does engaging in the process from design to product, emphasizing entrepreneurship, engineering, and the use of technology, lead to Explainers':  Deeper learning and 21st century skills?; STEM and ICT knowledge, skills, dispositions?; and Persistence in the STEM workforce? \r\n2. Does transferring the learning to younger students lead to deeper learning on the part of the Explainers (transfer and self-regulated learning), increased knowledge of the engineering process, and increased knowledge and skills in using technologies? \r\n3. Does participating in design-based activities increase middle and elementary students' positive attitudes, engagement and interest in STEM and STEM careers and lead to the perception of Explainers as role models? \r\n\r\nThe project will disseminate a replication handbook for scaling up the model and project evaluation reports. Project results will be further disseminated through articles submitted to peer-reviewed academic journals, workshops presented at museum conferences, and articles in other publications such as Make Magazine, a publication that targets those in the Maker movement.",
