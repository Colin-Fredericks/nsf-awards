 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elliptic variational inequalities are fundamental mathematical tools for modeling phenomena that  involve elliptic partial differential operators and constrained optimization. This project will develop and  analyze finite element methods for fourth and higher order elliptic variational inequalities, which arise  naturally for example in mechanics and elliptic optimal control problems.  A recent theoretical advance  by the PIs demonstrates that, for the displacement obstacle problems of Kirchhoff plates, the heart of  the error analysis involves only problems at the continuous level and therefore any finite element  method that works for fourth order boundary value problems can also be adapted for obstacle problems.   This new approach will be extended to other fourth and higher order variational inequalities with  different types of constraints, which will bring well-developed finite element methodologies for  boundary value problems (conforming and nonconforming methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods,  generalized finite element methods, isoparametric finite element methods, local mesh refinement,  singular function method, etc.) into the study of numerical solution of higher order variational  inequalities. Fast solvers for higher order variational inequalities, such as multigrid methods, domain  decomposition methods and adaptive methods, will also be developed.  In particular this project will  lead to new algorithms for second order elliptic distributed optimal control problems with pointwise  state and/or control constraints that are fundamentally different from existing algorithms.  \r\n\r\nThe results from this  project will provide new insights to the numerical solution of higher order  variational inequalities, an area that is becoming increasingly important as more and more complex  phenomena in science, engineering and finance are being modeled by higher order differential  equations. The outcomes of this project will impact diverse areas that require reliable and efficient  numerical algorithms for the solution of such inequalities.",
