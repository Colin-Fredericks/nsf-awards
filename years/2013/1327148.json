Signal processing and systems engineering communities can be important contributors to Big Data research and development, complementing computer and information science-based efforts in this direction. Recognizing the need to engage these communities, this workshop aims to bring together experts from various fields to carve out the role that analytical and experimental engineering has to play in Big Data research and development. Such a workshop will be unique in emphasizing signal analytics and systems engineering aspects of Big Data. Time is of essence, as the premise is to engage the engineering community and help shape up research directions for the next few years.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe workshop will address key questions in big data analytics in engineering disciplines.  Topics of interest include multidimensional signal analytics that build upon a signals and systems fabric, and systems engineering is sure to play an important role in designing and deploying such large, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis workshop will help engage engineering disciplines in Big Data research and development. The discussion results from the workshop will have significant impact on the research and development for big-scale engineering projects in the data-driven information age, as well as the training and education for future engineers. The workshop report will provide a useful resource for the scientific community and general public.",
