 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern multicores are designed around complex memory hierarchies that\r\nachieve high performance with a high cost in design complexity and\r\nefficiency. The reason is that delaying the memory access just a few\r\ncycles has an unacceptable performance impact. This proposal decouples\r\nthe memory operations in non-critical and critical. The critical\r\ncomponent is allowed to be incorrect which results in a system with\r\npower savings, simplifications in the memory hierarchy, and even the\r\nremoval of complex memory coherence.  The proposed sequential\r\nconsistency model allows simple programming models without performance\r\nor power consumption impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the challenge of excessive complexity in modern\r\nmulticore memory hierarchy. This complexity results in a power waste and\r\ndifficult programming models.  For modern systems, the memory hierarchy\r\nrepresents over half of the power. The proposed decoupled execution\r\nallows an energy efficient implementation by moving the complex\r\noperations out of the critical path. Furthermore, the proposed memory\r\nhierarchy allows for simpler parallel applications because it avoids\r\ncomplex consistency models commonly used. This proposal solution allows\r\nfor an efficient implementation of the simplest consistency model\r\navailable.  Overall, the PI hopes to make fundamental advances toward\r\nenergy efficient and simpler to use memory hierarchies.",
