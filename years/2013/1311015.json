 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Zane Pannell of University of Tennessee, Knoxville to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Tsinghua University Institute of Transportation Engineering in Beijing, China.  The project title is \"Road User Vulnerability - Impacts of the New E-Bike Mode.\" The host scientist is Dr. Yang Xinmiao.\r\n\r\nThis research is an opportunity to explore crash histories for users of all modes of traffic in Beijing, China. Although this project aims to focus on safety for modes, it concentrates specifically on electric bicycles (e-bikes). While a handful of studies have touched different aspects of multimodal safety, this study brings a new approach to safety, focusing on vulnerability and fault. This approach moves away from classic safety analysis (counting and normalizing injuries and fatalities) and focuses on quantifying vulnerability and fault. This is an important contribution because it moves policy toward protecting vulnerable road users (VRU) (e.g., bicyclists) from what is hypothesized as intrinsically dangerous road users (e.g., cars) rather than pointing at the VRU as the dangerous element in the transportation system simply because they are more represented in crash statistics.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the goal of this project is to help policy makers establish a policy in effort to reduce the number of e-bike crashes, which focuses on saving lives. This project can also help educate all modes of the transportation infrastructure on the vulnerabilities of e-bikes and make them more alert to e-bikes. In effort to broadcast the results, this project will be submitted to top safety journals and the results will be presented at conferences in the US and China. The results and traveling experience will also be presented at the Institute of Transportation Engineers and American Society of Civil Engineers meetings at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.",

Therefore, we can take a ratio of the sum of each j column and the sum of each i column to assess the total relative vulnerability for each individual mode. The calculation is as follows:\n\n Vi=&Sigma;I.j/&Sigma;I.i\n\n \n\nFor example, the total relative vulnerability for e-bikes is calculated as 47/28=1.69. The results for all modes, except fixed object, are summarized in Table 2.\n\n \n\nTable 2 Total Relative Vulnerability Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\n\n\n\nE-Bike\n\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n\nRegular Bike\n\n\n\nMotorcycle\n\n\n\nPedestrian\n\n\n\nBus\n\n\n\n\n\nVi\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n\n2.36\n\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n\n20.00\n\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBy ranking the total relative vulnerability for each mode from greatest to least, we can assess which mode is the most vulnerable to injury during a crash. The total relative vulnerability rankings from most vulnerable to least vulnerable are pedestrian, regular bike, e-bike, motorcycle, bus, and vehicle.\n\n From the results, pedestrians are the most vulnerable to injury because they have the highest exposure and are the slowest of all modes in our network. Regular bikes, e-bikes, and motorcycles are in the middle category of vulnerability. These are all two-wheeled modes of transportation without allowing any protection. Vehicles and buses are the least vulnerable mode because these modes are the most protected mode in our network. Bus riders are at the greatest risk of being injured when bus stops are located adjacent to e-bike and vehicle lanes. An interesting finding is that our ranking from greatest to least vulnerable modes has a direct correlation with speed. For example, vehicles are faster than buses, which are faster than motorcycles, which are faster than e-bikes and so on. Also, mass-momentum is factor because vehicles have a much greater mass than e-bikes and carry more momentum into a crash than e-bikes.\n\nIn conclusion, this study applies a new methodology to evaluate multimodal traffic safety. The relative vulnerability matrix allows insight to the vulnerability of e-bikes, the new emerging mode of transportation in China, with the rest of the modes in China\u00c6s transportation network.
