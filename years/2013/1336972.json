 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Freund, Jonathan \r\nProposal Number: 1336972\t\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that in small tubes and capillary vessels, red blood cells flow in a strikingly regular lined-up column, with viscous stresses deforming them into bullet-like shapes. This regularity fails in larger vessels or tubes, where the cells take on varied and intricate shapes and flow with irregular and apparently chaotic interactions. This work will investigate this apparent bifurcation, leading to the onset of instability and chaotic motion. It is both an important fluid mechanical instability, with biophysical implications, and an important consideration in the design of microfluidic devices that process blood cells. Forming and maintaining uniform rows of cells in such a device will facilitate processing them on a cell-by-cell basis for diagnostic or filtering purposes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nAlthough hydrodynamic interactions at the low Reynolds numbers of flowing red blood cells are linear, the overall system is significantly nonlinear. Geometric nonlinearities associated with the cell positions and their deformable shapes present analytical challenges. A systematic approach is proposed to develop a description, with predictive capability, focusing in particular on the factors leading to the destabilitization of flowing red blood cell columns. A highly accurate simulation tool will be used for the collective motion of interacting and realistically flexible blood cells flowing within complex-geometry tubes or vessels. It is a spectral boundary integral solver, which has been used in several recent studies, including the fundamental analysis of blood flow in small tubes, the transport of magnetic nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, and the biomedically important forces and transport effects of red blood cells on white blood cells as part of the inflammation response. \r\nPreliminary simulation results suggest the existence of a bifurcation between the lined-up flow and the apparently chaotic flow, which depends upon vessel diameter and cell volume fraction. Analytical work to describe the bifurcation will be pursued. The simulation will be used to calculate the linear interaction of all perturbation degrees of freedom and thereby will provide a complete linear dynamic model. This linear system will be analyzed with standard and, if necessary, transient algebraic growth methods to describe the behavior of small perturbations. A rigid-sphere analog is much more tractable and provides a starting-point for the proposed effort. An initial result for this is also presented. A goal is to advance understanding within a mathematical description to the point that a reduced dynamical description can then be used to predict phenomena of biological and microfluidic engineering importance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nStudies such as this at the juncture of fluid mechanics, advanced simulation, applied mathematics, and biophysics are fundamentally interdisciplinary and therefore of high value from an educational perspective. In this particular case the analytical tools will translate into a reduced description that can both illuminate biophysical phenomena and provide guidance for the analysis and design of microfluidic devices. The PI will broaden the STEM impact of this work via the development and distribution of a user-friendly reduced model of cell interactions. This will be done in collaboration with undergraduate research assistants, and with the goal to enable simulation-based bio-microfluidic design projects for simplified blood-cell-handling devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBlood is made up mostly of red blood cells, which give it its color and affect the way it flows.  Effects on its flow are most pronounced in the smallest of blood vessels, which have sizes that are similar to the size of the cells themselves.  This is a study of what happens in such vessels.  In particularly, for very narrow vessels (the smallest capillaries) the cells flow in single file.  In some sense, this is because that is the only way they fit.  Such a regular order is attractive for conceptual devices that might treat blood disorders at the cell scale.  Malaria, sickle cells disease, and even the simple aging of cells in blood banks are all cases of interest for this.  For any such cell-scale biomedical device, lining the cells up would make processing them easier.  A challenge, however, is that for vessels marginally larger than the smallest capillaries, the single-file flow breaks down, and the blood cells appear to flow chaotically.  Understanding the mechanism of this transition and describing it were the main scientific goals of this study.  It is hoped that understanding this stability problem might impact engineering design of advanced biomedical technologies.\n\n \n\nTo study this, we developed an advanced simulation tool and applied it to a series of vessel-like model configuration.  This showed the mechanics (the forces and motions) of how the transition from order to chaos happens, the character of the chaotic flow, and what might be done to suppress it.  The same simulation tool, in which the equations governing the coupled mechanics of the flow and the blood cells, has also been used in a series of related studies.  These include studies of how the stresses caused by flowing blood cells might trigger stages of embryonic heart development and how old blood cells can become trapped in narrow slits in the human spleen.  \n\n \n\nThis work involved rigorous integration of fluid mechanics, numerical simulation, the biological aspects of cell mechanics, and biomedical engineering.  Such intellectual bridges provide a means for fundamental science to impact engineering.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan B Freund"
