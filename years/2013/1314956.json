 "awd_abstract_narration": "The domain name system (DNS) protocol plays a significant role in operation of the Internet by enabling the bi-directional association of domain names with IP addresses.  It is also increasingly abused by malware, particularly botnets, by use of:  (1) automated domain generation algorithms for rendezvous with a command-and-control (C&C) server, (2) DNS fast flux as a way to hide the location of malicious servers, and (3) DNS as a carrier channel for C&C communications. This project explores the development of a scalable, hierarchical machine-learning stack, called HIMALAYAS, which specializes in algorithms for automatically mining DNS data for malware activity. In particular, we are interested in isolating both ordered and unordered sets of malware domain groups whose access patterns are temporally and logically correlated.  \r\n\r\nHIMALAYAS performs a task of increasing complexity at each level - starting from scalable clustering and feature selection at lower levels, to more advanced malware domain subsequence identification algorithms at higher levels. It has multiple benefits, including speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ability to use domain knowledge, which makes it very well suited for malware analysis and related tasks. The analysis by HIMALAYAS should accelerate the identification and takedown of malware domains on the Internet and improve services such as Google SafeSearch. \r\n\r\nThe machine-learning stack developed as part of the HIMALAYAS project has broader application to many important data mining problems, e.g., in financial data analysis, and mining user patterns from web access logs.  The project provides opportunities for students to participate in the development and transition of the technology.",
