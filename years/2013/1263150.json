 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed field research in Mali and Burkina Faso will complete a multi-year project documenting all languages of the Dogon family (Mali). These languages are especially interesting for their tonosyntactic systems, where certain words control tone overlays on adjacent words. A second feature of interest is that action verbs such as 'eat' and 'carry' are consistently expressed to include indication of manner or process of acting rather than, as in English, the function or result of acting. The project will also complete work on Bangime (Mali), a language isolate. Having established a second base in neighboring Burkina Faso, the project will also carry out primary documentation of two more endangered language, Jalkunan (Mande family) and Tiefo (Gur family), and will begin documentation of a third, Seeku (Mande). In addition to reference grammars (and spin-off journal articles), lexicons, and texts, the project is producing simple documentary videos of many practical activities and cultural events, is mapping the 1000 or so villages of the Dogon/Bangime and adjoining areas in Mali, and is developing guides to local flora-fauna including scientific identifications, native names in several languages, and ethnozoological information. Select grammars are being published through traditional venues and most of the materials collected will be disseminated on a project website.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's  International Science and Engineering Office and the Documenting Endangered Langauges Program.",

During the final grant period we completed and published several Dogon grammars and the Bangime grammar. We branched out to Burkina Faso to document two endangered languages, Tiefo-N and Jalkunan, and published grammars of them as well.</p>\n<p>The core project team was Jeffrey Heath (PI), Abbie Hantgan, Steven Moran, Laura McPherson, Vadim Dyachkov, Kirill Prokhorov, Aminata Ouattara, Minkailou Djiguiba, and the late Stefan Elders.</p>\n<p>A special feature of Dogon languages is what we call tonosyntax, where certain modifiers control tonal changes on the noun and any words in between. We identified the semantic principle determining which modifiers have such control power (adjectives, demonstratives, relative clauses, possessors) and which do not (numerals, universal quantifiers, 'only', 'even', topic, and usually definite markers). We also showed how conflicts between two controllers with different \"agendas\" are resolved. Finally, we showed how certain pairs of modifiers exert tonosyntactic control only when both are present, while each on its own is tonosyntactically inert.</p>\n<p>We are especially pleased that the work on Bangime was completed, in spite of the tragic death of project member Stefan Elders in 2007. Bangime is perhaps the only true genetic isolate among West African languages, having no demonstrable relationship to any language family in the area. It is spoken in a narrow cul-de-sac valley that cuts into the western edge of the Dogon plateau. It has its own extremely complex tonal system, combining tonal ablaut, tonal terracing, and low-level tone sandhi.</p>\n<p>It was also gratifying to complete the work on the endangered Burkina languages Jalkunan and Tiefo-N. The latter in particular had been given up for dead, but we identified two elderly speakers, whose only other language is the locally dominant Jula. A team of the PI, Abbie Hantgan, and Aminata Ouattara were able to collect enough data for a short reference grammar and a lexicon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to grammars, lexicons, and texts, our project has three other components. The first is flora-fauna. We have systematically collected flora-fauna terminology from all of the languages we have worked on in Mali and Burkina (and a few others). In the course of this work we have photographed or collected specimens of over one thousand plant and animal species. The website tsammalex.clld.org presents the terms in each language along with images from us and from the web. The project has produced one published paper on the ethnoentomology of grasshoppers, and specimens we collected are featured in a herpetology journal.</p>\n<p>The second is geography. We have taken GPS coordinates of several hundred Dogon and non-Dogon villages, along with some basic information about each. This material is most easily accessed in the interactive Villages page of our project website, dogonlanguages.org.</p>\n<p>The third is documentary videos. Over ten years, we have filmed and produced some fifty short documentaries, mostly of Dogon and Bangime but also a few of Fulbe and montane Songhay. These are viewable on the Videos page of our project website, and are archived in multiple video formats at deepblue.lib.umich.edu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/14/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;G&nbsp;Heath</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263150/1263150_10251065_1550164605607_Bounouwell--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263150/1263150_10251065_1550164605607_Bounouwell--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"well at Bounou village\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1263150/1263150_10251065_1550164605607_Bounouwell--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"well at Bounou village\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Well at the school in Bounou village, built by project members with personal funds.
