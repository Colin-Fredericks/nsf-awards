This study is a plan to describe quantum dot fate in representative aquatic settings subjected to broad chemical conditions while exploring specific degradation mechanisms and environmental factors that influence these processes. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanocrystals with core/shell structures often less than 20 nm and employed in fluorescent measurements and energy applications, and, like other metallic nanoparticles studied over the past decade, may undergo physical (aggregation) and chemical (dissolution) transformations that influence their overall bioavailability upon release to receiving water bodies. While the toxicity of CdSe/ZnS QD and their leached metals have been examined closely for a variety of microorganisms, more mechanistic details of their degradation processes is needed for the various classes of QDs subjected to diverse aquatic chemistries in order to better predict their overall fate.\r\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to determine how different types of QDs, both conventional and next-generation, degrade in aquatic environments and waste streams. Specific objectives are (1) to develop a robust, rapid analytical procedure for identifying and quantifying QD elements in their particulate, complexed, and dissolved forms with almost no sample pre-treatment using single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC-ICPMS), (2) to identify the ligand groups of various types of organic matter that promote QD degradation and element release, (3) to determine influence of UV and visible light in promoting QD degradation, (4) to evaluate other inorganic geochemistry factors such as dissolved hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfide that may influence QD degradation, and (5) to determine whether physicochemical properties of QD coatings can be altered to prevent QD degradation. Reaction rates and product distributions will be determined within batch reactors containing various combinations of QDs and geochemical constituents. The results will provide fundamental information on the roles of geochemical solution conditions, dissolved organic compounds, and UV and visible light exert on the dissolution of a variety of QDs. The SP-ICPMS developed here will have application to other metallic nanoparticle measurements in waters.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe laboratory investigations into QD degradation processes will lead to a deeper understanding of QD longevity to be expected upon release into aquatic environments, and this information will lead to improved designs of QD coatings. This work will provide education for one graduate student per year and several undergraduate students in environmental engineering. The research opportunity provides diverse experimental and analytical instrumentation training in water quality, inorganic synthesis chemistry, and mineralogical techniques. Broadened participation of underrepresented groups will be addressed by providing experiential learning opportunities through hands-on laboratory engagement to undergraduate students, Massachusetts state teachers, and local high school students. Their research experiences will be integrated into the PI's Research Program by supporting QD synthesis, reaction, and characterization methods as well as the Educational Program by assisting development of educational materials for the instruction of broad audiences about the principles of environmental science and engineering. These materials are intended to foster systems thinking education using WWW-based multimedia modules comprised of graphical, video, and systems modeling tools. The results of this Educational Program will reach local middle school, high school, and undergraduate students through field trip demonstrations and curriculum modules.",

QDs usually contain a semiconducting CdS, CdTe, or CdSe core which is sometimes coated with a protective ZnS shell, and at times may be surrounded by a capping agent which gives QDs stability in aqueous or solvent suspensions or needed biological compatibility. With the projected market for the QD enabled products reaching billions of dollars annualy, QDs entrance to the aquatic environments seems inevitable by ways of product disposal in landfills or waste streams from manufacturing.  Consequently, the chemical processes that cause QDs to persist or dissolve in water require attention. \n\n \n\nPredicting QD behavior in nature is challenged by limited understanding of how QD chemical and structural composition influences their reactivity.  Their unique core-shell-capping agent structure and semiconducting properties should provide QDs with a distinct reactivity in water compared to their naturally occurring, bulk (&lt;100 nm sized) metal sulfide or selenide minerals, or compared to more homogeneous engineered nanomaterials such as silver or gold nanoparticles (~5-100 nm).  Enhanced reactivity of QDs is expected due to their high specific surface areas and abundance of lattice strains at surfaces or between core-shell boundaries.  Light also promotes QD dissolution due to their semiconducting photoactivity.  Conversely, shell layers and capping agent coatings may provide a layer of protection for the core against dissolution and prolong core solids.  The goal of this project was to better understand the relationship between QD composition, QD dissolution rates, and water chemistry influences.\n\n \n\nThis study aimed to investigate important water chemistry factors that control the dissolution of QDs in aquatic environments.  Experiments were conducted to follow QD dissolution over months while exposed to different water chemistries.  Dissolved and solid-phase metal concentrations were measured simultaneously using a newly-developed online size exclusion chromatography separation process connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Dissolution results show that within anoxic, aphotic, neutral pH environments, CdSe/ZnS QDs are slow dissolve, with progressive ZnS dissolution over weeks and the core CdSe mineral remaining solid for over two months.  Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and metal complexing ligands accelerate QD dissolution in these dark conditions.  Dissolved organic matter was also found to promote aggregation of QDs. \n\n \n\nThe presence of light significantly enhances QD dissolution rates and can decrease QD lifetimes to less than one day.  Due to their semiconducting abilities, QDs when exposed to light create electron-hole pairs which were observed to be responsible for oxidation of core and shell minerals as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species, among which hydrogen peroxide was chiefly identified as a secondary oxidant.  The presence of commonly found solutes including nitrate, nitrite, iron, and dissolved organic matter increased QD dissolution rates by way of catalyzing secondary reactive oxygen species that further oxidized QD minerals.  To better quantify QD dissolution rates, a new dissolution kinetic model was created which accounts for the core-shell structure of QDs.  Using the kinetic model on dissolution experiments performed with a wide range of commercially available QDs, it was observed that higher band gap values, smaller QD diameters, and low shell thickness are the most important structural factors causing rapid QD photodegradation.  These results imply that the next generation QDs should consider thicker shell layers or other protective coatings to better resist release of toxic metals from dissolution. \n\n \n\nThis project provided research opportunities for two graduate students and one undergraduate student.  Students received training in diverse topics of environmental engineering including nanomaterial characterization, mass spectrometry, environmental analytical chemistry, and water quality analysis.  One PhD dissertation, one Masters report, and one publication were produced, and four other publications are in preparation or under review.  This project also supported two Research Experience for Teachers participants, one Research Experience for Undergraduates participants, and two Young Scholars Program participants.  These participants constructed benchtop models that demonstrate water treatment unit operations and pollution dispersion and reaction in natural systems.  To accompany the model reactors, video demonstrations and theoretical explanations were created and made available to high school and university students through a website that provides learning modules on physical-chemical processes in environmental engineering and science.  Research results were also incorporated into the PI?s graduate and undergraduate courses in environmental chemistry.

Fundamental information on quantum dot degradation and aggregation processes were also required.  The results should be helpful in predicting the fate of nanomaterials in the environment. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Larese-Casanova"
