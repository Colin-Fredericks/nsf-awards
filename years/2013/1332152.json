 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) comprised of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MUST) and the University of Houston (UH). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to explore and develop statistical analysis methodologies for practical EMC and Signal Integrity applications. The proposed research will be focused on two areas: 1) charactering effects of geometry/material variations, manufacturing tolerances, and process variations on high-speed signal channel performance; and, 2) characterizing random noise sources through nearfield scanning. Various methodologies will be investigated through modeling and measurements, and the gained insights can be used to develop effective design tools for specific practical engineering applications in the next step. The high-speed design community has neither systematic experimental procedures nor simulation-based tools for addressing random effects in complex real-world problems, which are critical when the industry moves ahead to the next generation of designs. The proposed study will close this gap by developing and improving general statistical analysis methodologies for real-world EMC and signal integrity applications. \r\n\r\nThe successful completion of the project will result in a deep understanding of various statistical analysis methodologies for high-speed designs, which can provide useful insights and guideline for engineering CAD tool development. The outcome of the project can help the nation to maintain its competitive advantages in high tech industry. The next generation of electronic, computer, and communication systems will benefit when more accurate modeling and measurement techniques to address random effects become available. The knowledge gained in this project can inspire similar ideas and approaches in other engineering fields to incorporate statistical methodologies. The proposed innovative research will be effectively integrated into education to transfer the developed technologies into the minds and hands of the next generation workforce. Research findings and results will be disseminated through the IUCRC CEMC to the center members, and through conferences, publications, and websites to the general public.",
