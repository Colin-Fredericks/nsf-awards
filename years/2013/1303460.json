Complex analysis of biological systems provides biological knowledge for the organization, management and mining of biological data by using advanced computational tools. The biological data are inherently complex, non-uniform and collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The investigations of complex biological systems and processes require an extensive collaboration between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers to improve our understanding of the various complex biological processes from gene to system. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The main objective of the summer school is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and bioengineering students to the relatively new approaches of Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno (NBIC) Technologies and translational research. This summer school will be helpful, also, to students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in pursuing research in biology, bio-molecular engineering and bioengineering, since the summer school provides exceptional insights into the fundamental challenges in biological sciences. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The summer school uses lectures, oriented toward biological science students, by expert faculty and will focus on the Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno (NBIC) Technologies and Translational Research: Opportunities and Challenges. In addition to these lectures, the summer school will employ 2 two-hour panel discussion, with active participation by the summer school participants, focused on Engineering Better Medicines and Advances in Biomedical Engineering Research and Education in the World. The summer school will stimulate further interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical researchers, and will help in identifying new, challenging directions in complex biological science and bioengineering research.",
