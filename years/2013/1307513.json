 "awd_abstract_narration": "String theory provides consistent high-energy extrapolations of theoretical models of particle physics, as well as naturally unifying those models with gravity, and provides tools of mathematical physics with a number of applications in theoretical physics. One promising type of string theory model known as F-theory has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years which points out the need for some basic foundational studies. These studies involve a sophisticated branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which provides the background for constructing the physical models. The PI will determine what are the restrictions for gauge groups and matter content for F-theory models, both on Calabi-Yau threefolds and Calabi-Yau fourfolds; whether every elliptically-fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold is birational to an equidimensional family, and if not, what is the physical interpretation of the fibers of large dimension; the structure of the base of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold; the F-theory interpretation of Calabi-Yau manifolds which have a genus one fibration that is not elliptic (i.e., there is no section); how the birational geometry of the total space of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold interacts with the choices of flux on that fourfold, and in particular, to what extent F-theory vacua are necessarily lifted by fluxes; the M-theory dual interpretation of the theory of T-branes; can the duality between F-theory and nongeometric heterotic strings be extended; and other topics in Calabi-Yau geometry which may be relevant to F-theory, including further exploration of the recent discovery that the gauged linear sigma models which describe Calabi-Yau manifolds contain via a partition function on S2 a wealth of information about the Calabi-Yau manifold. \r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe project will also have a broader impact through educational activities of the PI, at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as well as through the PI's ongoing efforts to streamline scientific communication by making as much of it available electronically as possible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe world around us can be well-described by a variety of physical theories.  The ones which are closest to laboratory measurements often involve approximations, and one of the lessons of the last 100 years is that those approximate theories are often just a shadow of theories which are valid (and even more precise) at very high energies.  The study of those high energy theories is somewhat indirect, but they were the heart of this research project.  The principal investigator was employing a particular mathematical tool known as the theory of elliptic fibriations to study the high-energy behavior of physical theories which can describe the world around us, particularly the world of particle physics.\n\nIn the course of this study, the investigator drew upon his extensive knowledge of the mathematical aspects of these theories.  He was able to refine the mathematical description of the theory in question -- a closely related cousin of string theory known as \"F-theory.\"  With the refined description in hand, and in collaboration with other scientists, the investigator was able to classify certain physical theories with special properties -- the \"superconformal\" theories and the \"little string\" theories.  The classification results were obtained in six spacetime dimensions but also have direct implications for theories in fewer spacetime dimensions (such as four).  \n\nThe results from this project are mainly applicable at high energy, and direct tests of the correspinding physics will depend on extrapolation to high energy or on careful derivation of low-energy conequences of the high-energy theories.  The study of those theories from a mathematical perspective also produced a number of concrete examples in the mathematics of Calabi--Yau manifolds and some associated manifolds in higher dimension (manifolds with holonomy \"G2\").\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Morrison"
