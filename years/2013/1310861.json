 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Adrienne George of University of South Florida, College of Marine Science to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Chinese Academy of Sciences, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology in Guangzhou, China.  The project title is \"Comparing Coral Diseases and Parasites at Sites with Anthropogenic Stress at Sanya, Hainan Island.\" The host scientist is Dr. Kefu Yu.\r\n\r\nThis project characterizes and compares coral diseases and parasites in China at three reef sites (Luhuitou, Xiaodonghai and Dadonghai fringing reefs) at Sanya, Hainan Island. This project identifies coral diseases and parasites in China through coral health surveys, analysis of carbon requirements of the microbes in coral mucus, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and histological examination. This is the first comprehensive study to characterize and identify the coral diseases of Sanya, Hainan Island, China.  Currently, there is very little information on coral disease and parasitism in China. This study provides baseline information for researchers that will carry on the work. The results of this study will give the host country a better understanding of their coral reef ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, a catalogue of coral lesions is being made freely available on Dr. Yu's Chinese Academy of Sciences web page. This allows researchers, scientists and the general public to have access to this information. Additionally, results of the study will be presented at scientific meetings and we expect at least one peer-reviewed publication.",
