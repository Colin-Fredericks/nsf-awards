 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cyber-learning tool was developed to enable the integration of campus sustainability projects into a wide variety of classes as relevant, experiential learning sites. The broad goal of this endeavor is to engage undergraduate students in order to help them develop the STEM related skills needed in the 21st Century. The goal of this project is to develop, pilot and assess a framework that can be employed as a step towards future use at other universities. The framework includes the cyber-learning infrastructure for campus sustainability (CLICS), as well as examples of how these data can be used in project-based learning experiences, and an agenda for training instructors to design experiential learning modules using such a tool in their own classes. Assessment and evaluation provides preliminary evidence that the approach engages students and helps them excel in 21st century STEM skills. The development and assessment of a framework for cyber-infrastructure tools and training to help bring the value of CLICS into the classroom represents the primary intellectual merit of this project. CLICS includes specifications for sensors, data acquisition and a schematic-based open-source graphical interface to enable easy user access and interpretation.  Eleven faculty members are trained to use CLICS in their classrooms, impacting over 300 students per year.  Many classes that do address sustainability issues have a relatively high percentage of female students.  Thus, this project disproportionately supports gender diversity in STEM classes.",

The broad goal of this endeavor is to engage undergraduate students in order for them to excel their competencies with 21st Century skills [1], including STEM content, sustainability literacy and critical thinking.\n\nNSF TUES funding was used to develop CLICS\u00c6 computational and educational framework, pilot the methods at Clarkson University and assess its impact on students. CLICS has been developed with data specific to Clarkson\u00c6s integrated greenhouse and digester project.  This data-rich infrastructure provides a wealth of opportunities for understanding and evaluating engineered systems from diverse disciplines and perspectives. \n\nIn the implementation of the CLICS interface and data into a variety of classroom experiences., our goal was to support instructors with the opportunity to use these real-world and relevant data to meet learning objectives in their particular class. The CLICS program provides:\n\ntraining of instructors to understand the engineered systems and use of Mango;\nproject ideas;\ndevelopment of basic report templates that can be used directly or adapted for students\u00c6 data access needs; and,\ntutorials and presentations for classes to help students understand the physical systems and data access procedures.\n\n\nAfter the development and testing of the system over 4 semesters, CLICS was used in 17 classes reaching 830 students. Evaluation results indicated that over 70% of all students strongly agreed/agreed that the overall experience of using campus data was positive and recommended that CLICS should be used in other classes and all participating instructors indicated that they would continue to integrate place-based data into course assignments and would expand the use into different courses. \n\nAssessment of sustainability literacy and ctritical thinking attributes highlighted an intersting difference between students in engineering classes and students in math classes (who were also largely engineering majors).  The use of real-world data and data analysis in engineering classes resulted in higher scores on each of the three dimensions of sustainability literacy and the critical thinking rubric.  These differences could stem from the nature of the assignments in the different classes or the expectations that these types of real-world projects are an expected aspect of engineering classes, but not math classes.\n\nIntegrating project evaluation comments with the research team's observations, several key elements were identified are critical to the success of this type of project.

The inclusion of a field trip to the site (which was feasible in smaller classes), help to provide students with an adequate understanding of the system they were studying.\nTraining is critical, but not sufficient for instructors.  Instructors must also actually engage in the project data acquisition and analysis they expected of their students to understand the system and work required to effectively teach their students \nMango is not recommended into the future.  This open source software was selected to facilitate the expansion of this project to other universities.  However, even with the improvements made wt the graphical-based GUI and virtual data, the system was not sufficiently intuitive and easy to use in comparison to professional software and apps today's students expect.\nSubstantially more bandwidth to access the data server is required for education purposes compared with research purposes.  \n\n\nUltimately, the success of the CLICS concept has been embraced by Clarkson Universi..."
