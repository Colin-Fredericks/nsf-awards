TAMUCC is an HSI and PVAMU is an HBCU. This Alliance is requesting a renewal of LSAMP funding to focus on determining and sharing promising practices to continue increasing STEM enrollment, B.S. graduation rates, and preparation for graduate school for URM students. The goal of the project is to sustain and institutionalize successful prior LSAMP efforts and refine strategies for increasing the number of well-prepared URM students attaining STEM B.S. degrees, who are globally competitive and motivated to pursue a graduate education.",
