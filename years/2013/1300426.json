 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues funding of a Center to foster research and education at the interface of the mathematical and biological sciences. The goals of the Center are to address fundamental and applied biological questions while advancing the mathematical sciences, and to foster the development of transdisciplinary researchers. An interdisciplinary perspective, linking biology to the physical and social sciences, is needed to advance modern biology along a broad array of challenging problems while providing avenues for fundamental advances in mathematics. The Center will develop a series of small working groups focused on topics that will benefit from interdisciplinary efforts through an open call to the entire community so as to make the center truly a national community resource. These efforts have the potential to transform the way that mathematicians and biologists collaborate, a cultural change that will spur significant progress in both disciplines and at their interface. \r\n\r\nOver the past century biology has changed from mostly describing the patterns of the living world to determining how these patterns arose, what processes affect them and how we might effectively modify and manage them. In collaboration with government and industry partners, the Center will provide scientific insights into problems such as the control of invasive species, limiting impacts of infectious diseases, and suggesting new methods for drug design. Thus the Center will produce new knowledge that will help to shape national policy. Educational initiatives at all levels, from K-12 students to post-doctoral scholars, will illustrate the connections of mathematics to all areas of biology and will train a new generation of mathematical biologists. These efforts will be guided by the need to broaden participation by groups under-represented in the biological and mathematical sciences. The Center will develop a strong public outreach effort through a significant partnership and research collaboration with the National Park Service targeting visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.",

This has involved the use of mathematics, statistics and computing to address both core biological questions and those focused on specific applications, considering processes operating at scales across the entire range of biotic systems, from within cells to the globe. The objective of NIMBioS has been to foster new collaborations that encouraged researchers and students to appreciate the potential for benefit to science and society of work at the interface of mathematics, life science, computational science and social science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />There have been over 10,000 visits by individuals from more than 55 countries and every US State in scientific collaborative activities at NIMBioS, including researchers, educators and students. NIMBioS has supported 58 Working Groups with 184 meetings, 55 Investigative Workshops, 30 Tutorials, 12 undergraduate summer research programs, 52 Postdoctoral Fellows and 14 large conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />NIMBioS programs and results have enhanced collaborations between diverse academic communities, fostering convergent research and education in the United States and the world. Project outcomes include: (i) supported more than 450 projects proposed by the science community, leading to the publication of over 1000 peer-reviewed scientific articles; (ii) investigated numerous questions of direct public policy concern, particularly the analysis of the potential spread, impact and control of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin, including West Nile virus, anthrax, malaria, swine flu and mad cow disease; (iii) active engagement of participants from diverse backgrounds and establishment of methods to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented groups in NIMBioS events, as compared to the representation of these individuals receiving doctorates in the biological and mathematical sciences; (iv) supported over 280 education and outreach activities with more than 2,400 participants from primary school level through graduate school level including programs promoting equity in science, engineering, technology and mathematics (STEM); (v) broadened reach to wider audiences via a live streaming infrastructure, which hosted over 5,000 virtual participants in NIMBioS activities; (vi) established NIMBioS Interactive, a virtual collaborative space for the NIMBioS community in response to an increased emphasis on virtual events during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic; (vii) created a systems-based approach to program evaluation of center-scale effectiveness which included more than 200 systematic evaluations of NIMBioS activities and events; (viii) fostered the development of the National Institute for STEM Evaluation and Research (NISER) which provides evaluation services for STEM research and education projects around the US, (ix) fostered the development of the Center for the Dynamics of Social Complexity (DySoC.org) which promotes transdisciplinary research into the origins, evolution, and futures of human social complexity; (x) produced a video library of more than 600 videos with more than 280,000 views and 2300 subscribers, featuring scientist interviews, science narratives, workshops, tutorials, seminars, webinars and educational events.</p>\n<p><br />Some NIMBioS outcomes are illustrated in the accompanying figures.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of peer-reviewed publications reported to NIMBioS that arose from each of the different types of activities supported.
