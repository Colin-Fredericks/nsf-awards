 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will focus on determining how spatial ability is affected by navigational experience and how spatial abilities differ by gender and change with age.  Previous research has observed that males generally have larger geographic ranges than females across a wide range of cultures, and males generally have done significantly better at some spatial tests.  Because large ranges pose navigational and spatial challenges, many theorists have speculated that gender-related differences in mobility may underlie gender-related differences in spatial performance.  This project will test three hypotheses that may explain the root causes of gender-related differences in mobility patterns and evaluate how natural mobility, navigational style, and spatial ability are related.  Because there are large cultural differences in age and gender-related patterns of mobility, this project will include participants in communities in Tanzania, Namibia, and Ecuador that subsist on foraging and small-scale farming, and it also will include participants in the United States, where lifestyles are considerably different.  The researchers will assess mobility through the use of interviews and by tracking subjects using GPS devices.  They will assess navigational and spatial ability through the use of cognitive tests adapted to make them broadly applicable across cultures.  The navigational data will based on both real-world and virtual world tasks and will include both field and laboratory-based components.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance basic understanding of the factors that shape spatial performance as well as how it differs by gender and across cultures.  The project will test a number of hypotheses that have been posited in hopes of relating spatial ability to different kinds of experience.  Because spatial skills are related to higher levels of performance in mathematics and science, and women and minorities are underrepresented in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology-related fields, greater knowledge about the factors that enhance spatial thinking has the potential to make scientific and technical education and related employment opportunities more broadly accessible.  The project will develop and disseminate assessment tools that can be used with people of all ages and different cultures, including non-literate populations, which should help improve spatial capabilities for people in many different environments.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.",

Accordingly, the project asked two main questions: (1) why do males range farther, and how does this vary across cultures and across the lifespan?  and (2) can gender differences in mobility explain gender differences in spatial ability? \n\nOur cognitive abilities evolved in the context of small-scale foraging economies, and so we addressed these questions using cross-cultural data from several forager-horticultural societies, as well as laboratory studies using naturalistic virtual environments.  We found that males had larger ranges and better spatial ability than females in all four societies that depend in full or part on hunting and gathering, but the gender differences in range size (measured by GPS and interview) and in spatial ability (dead-reckoning and mental rotation) were large in the savanna groups (Hadza and Twe) and small in the tropical forest goups (Tsimane and Shuar), where travel and visibility are limited by dense vegetation. Gender differences in range size and spatial ability, therefore, are not unique to industrial societies, but they are also not invariant, and appear to respond to the navigational demands of traveling in these different environments.\n\nBecause these gender differences are found widely across cultures, we considered some explanations that have been advanced by biologists for other species that show similar sex differences.  One is that larger male ranges reflect male-male mating competition, another is that smaller female ranges reflect constraints of parenting.  We found variable support for these hypotheses, where the motives for male mobility appear to reflect societal differences in family patterns.  A third hypothesis is that these differences reflect the sexual division of labor in foraging societies, particularly the greater navigational challenges facing hunters of mobile prey.  This is consistent with mobility patterns among the Hadza, who depend heavily on hunting and gathering, and where men travel over much larger ranges and along more winding routes than Hadza women.\n\nWe have used virtual environments to understand whether and how these differences in mobility are related to differences in spatial ability.  In one study, we found that while men were more accurate navigators, errors were smaller among people who traveled more widely in daily life, and the effect was greatest for women.  We have also found that harm avoidance may play an important mediating role.  Females are, by many measures, more harm avoidant and risk-averse, and this appears to influence the way they travel, and consequently the spatial information they gain from this travel.  When exploring for hidden objects in a virtual environment, women moved more cautiously, as reflected in more pausing during travel and more revisiting of previously traversed locations, and these patterns of exploration partially accounted for gender differences in navigational accuracy.

Continued spatial experience may also be important in successful cognitive aging.  Our results thus far indicate that in our forager-horticultural populations, where people remain highly mobile into old age, performance on abstract spatial tasks declines in old age but performance on tests of navigational ability is preserved.  \n\nSpatial thinking is important not only in daily life but in participation in STEM (science, engineering and math) fields.  Knowing the factors that shape variation in spatial performance, therefore, has the potential to help address disparities in participation in STEM.  Our spatial tests were developed to be suitable for a wide range of ages and cultures, which also contributes to that mission.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth A Cashdan"
