The study will proceed from relatively simple flows in capillaries to more complex ones, involving fingering instability and buoyancy-driven flows of brine-supercritical CO2 mixtures in porous media. Results will be used to determine behavior near critical points in these systems and to establish the validity of a theory. \r\n\r\nStorage of CO2 in a supercritical state in earth formations (porous media) is currently being proposed as means to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration requires the storage of CO2 in its supercritical state in contact with subsurface brines. Supercritical fluids are also used as green solvents in industrial processes such as decaffeination and enhanced oil recovery. The results of the present study will be useful in assessing the risks and in designing safer carbon sequestration and industrial processes that use supercritical fluids.",
