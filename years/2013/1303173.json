 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on questions that arise in the study of algebraic varieties and their cohomology, many of which have arithmetic applications. Earlier work of the PI and others has led to substantial recent developments in our understanding of operations on cohomology arising from correspondences, and also to a new suite of problems which the PI will investigate. The PI will study questions of independence of l for actions of correspondences on various cohomology theories (specifically etale, intersection, and crystalline cohomology), continue his work on localized chern classes, and study global questions using trace formulas. These lines of investigation are motivated by the theory of motives, which predicts independence of l results for certain operators on cohomology and suggests that their traces should have geometric significance.In addition, the PI will continue earlier work researching algebraic stacks, abelian varieties, log geometry, Fourier-Mukai transforms,  and moduli spaces. The PI will continue to advise Ph.D. students working on projects related to the proposed research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work concerns basic geometric structures, such as cohomology, moduli spaces, and stacks, which lie at the core of algebraic geometry and its interactions with other fields, including number theory, representation theory, combinatorics,  and practical applications. Roughly algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of geometric properties of algebraic varieties, which are solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Cohomology theories provide some of the most powerful techniques for the study of such varieties. For example, the Lefschetz trace formula can be used to estimate numbers of solutions of polynomials over finite fields, and more generally cohomology groups of algebraic varieties are one of the main sources of Galois representations, which are fundamental objects in modern number theory. The proposal addresses problems on cohomology theories arising in this context. Another fundamental approach to the study of algebraic varieties is through their classification and moduli spaces. The PI's work on moduli spaces and stacks will continue to advance our understanding of key moduli spaces and provide broadly applicable foundational tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe project concerned a variety of fundamental questions about the structure of algebraic varieties.  Very roughly the basic objects of study in algebraic geometry are sets of solutions to polynomial equations and the geometric and arithmetic properties of these so-called varieties.  Some of the basic invariants we consider when studying such varieties are their cohomology, especially etale and crystalline cohomology in the arithmetic setting, derived categories of coherent sheaves, and moduli spaces.  The project furthered our understanding in all three areas.  More specifically the project was concerned with questions of independence of l for etale and crystalline cohomology, arithmetic questions related to Fourier-Mukai transforms, and moduli spaces and log geometry.  Results obtained include results on the motivic nature of local terms arising for correspondences acting on etale sheaves, new results about about varieties with equivalent derived categories in positive characteristic, and moduli spaces for spherical varieties.  The work in the project also opened up several new directions of research which will be explored in the future.  Most of the work was conducted with collaborators and students.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nThe main broader impact activities were centered around the training of graduate students in the PIs research group.  The PI also organized conferences and gave mini-courses and other lectures on topics related to the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin C Olsson"
