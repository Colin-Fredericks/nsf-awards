The conference encourages and financially supports participation by members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest in computatonal mathematics. The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in numerical linear algebra, with emphasis on preparing Ph.D. students for useful and engaging research careers. Allocation of the funds will be based on scientific merit, financial need, and diversity, with an emphasis on participation by members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://g2s3.cs.ucdavis.edu",
