 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to liberate wireless access networks currently constrained by spectral and energy scarcity via a new framework, referred to as FreeNet, by exploiting cognitive networking and green energy. FreeNet will be designed and optimized using a series of novel techniques such as dynamic network architecture optimization, network resource aware traffic scheduling, and spectrum sharing. The network architecture optimization framework will apply advanced probability theory to investigate inherent relationships between the optimal network architecture and the availability of spare spectrum and green energy, and adopt control theory to adapt the network architecture according to the dynamics of the spare spectrum and green energy. The network resource aware traffic scheduling and spectrum sharing algorithms will be designed based on optimization theory. Finally, theoretical analysis will be reduced to practice and translated into communications protocols in enabling and prototyping FreeNet. The theoretical analysis will elicit a series of theorems to direct the utilization of green energy in communication networks. \r\n\r\nThe communication protocols design and FreeNet prototyping will provide guidelines for designing resource aware communication systems. The research activities will advance the understanding of inherent relationships among the network architecture, traffic scheduling, spectrum utilization, and energy consumption. FreeNet will be deployed for offloading mobile traffic in urban areas, delivering content in rural areas, and enhancing emergency communication capacity during natural disasters. FreeNet will improve the availability and capacity of wireless networks, broaden the benefits of wireless networking, and enhance the living environment, the earth, by reducing the release of carbon footprints. Research outcomes from this project will be disseminated via publications and a website with frequent updates. Other broader impacts include integration of research and education through participation of both undergraduate and graduate students in the project, incorporation of research outcomes into course work, interactions and exchanges with invited speakers, and seeking involvement of REU students and under-represented groups.",

The project has applied control theory to enable each individual network node to cooperate with each other based on the availability of spare spectrum and green energy. Various algorithms related to wireless energy transfer, smart grid green energy sharing, traffic scheduling, spectrum sharing, and communications/storage/computing resource exchange and trading, have been designed and investigated based on optimization theory. This project has formulated and solved varioous networking problems in hybrid energy powered cognitive radio networks. Software simulation platforms and hardware testbeds have been developed to validate the performance of the developed solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FreeNet, liberating the spectrum and energy constraints of the wireless networks, will significantly enhance availability and capacity of wireless networks, and will broaden the benefits of wireless networking. The research activities advance the understanding of the inherent relationships among the network architecture, the traffic scheduling, the spectrum utilization, and the energy consumption. Moreover, FreeNet will enhance our living environment, the earth, by reducing the release of carbon footprints. In addition, FreeNet provides public benefits during emergencies. Remote access equipment is currently powered by a combination of public power, backup batteries, and varying degrees of local generation. Technologies developed by this project can extend operation as an emergency backup to help protect the public health and safety. The main products of this project include 2 book chapters, 18 journal papers, 17 conference papers, 4 non-provisional patent applications, and 3 awarded US patents. Through participation of this Freenet project, three Ph.D. students and one MS student have successfully completed their degree requirements and graduated, by having defended their respective doctoral dissertations and thesis; likewise, three undergraduate students, recruited, as REU, to prototype a small scale testbed in powering a cellular network with hybrid energy sources, have acquired their BS degrees.

Meanwhile, the tradeoff between the network performance and the energy efficiency in hybrid energy powered wireless access networks has been studied. A novel traffic load balancing framework has been developed to strike a balance between network performance (e.g., the average traffic delivery latency) and the green energy utilization.

In addition, optimal power management schemes have been proposed in the two hop relay networks with either a) energy harvesting enabled source node which can harvest energy from the forwarding signals transmitted by the relay node, or b) energy harvesting enabled source node and relay node, where they can harvest energy from the radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by each other.</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dual-battery enabled green energy harvesting architecture has been designed to enable access points to efficiently harvest, store, and utilize green energy.

Based on the proposed architecture, the green energy aware live virtual machine (VM) migration method has been designed to migrate VMs from the cloudlets without residual green energy generation to the cloudlets with sufficient green energy generation, thus minimizing the on-grid energy consumption of the network, while guaranteeing the average end-to-end delay between mobile users and its virtual machine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msoanchor_1\">[XS1]</a>This part is related to the intellectual merit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msoanchor_2\">[XS2]</a>Please double check the numbers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msoanchor_3\">[XS3]</a>This part is related to broader of impacts</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/03/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nirwan&nbsp;Ansari</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320468/1320468_10268895_1531331697732_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320468/1320468_10268895_1531331697732_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig1.jpg\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1320468/1320468_10268895_1531331697732_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig1.jpg\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1 The smart grid enabled mobile network (derived from X.
