The striking electron liquid phases occur in highest quality semiconductor hetero-structures in large magnetic fields. This research employs measurements of low-lying modes to uncover exciting physics that dictates the emergence of novel electron matter from unique Coulomb interactions in two-dimensions. Here, partially populated higher Landau levels are hosts to remarkable states like the fascinating even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall fluids that occur in the second Landau level. Excitations in charge and/or spin degrees of freedom will be measured by unique resonant inelastic light scattering methods at low temperatures below 50milliKelvin degrees that are achieved in dilution refrigerators. The award will support the PhD dissertation research of a graduate student and enable the participation in these projects of highly qualified undergraduate students. This research should uncover physics of fundamental many-electron interactions that would greatly expand the frontiers of studies of strongly interacting low-dimensional electron systems.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nWhen embedded in high magnetic fields electron systems in artificial high quality semiconductor hetero-junctions display intriguing phases that manifest the striking weirdness of quantum mechanics. Of primary interest are the intriguing even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall effect states in the second Landau level. This project is a quest in which measurements of low-lying excitation modes, by advanced light scattering methods at very low temperatures, uncover exciting new electron physics that emanates from quantum interactions in reduced dimensionality semiconductors. Novel low-dimensional electron systems attract broad attention. Progress in understanding their fundamental physics and their materials science advance the state-of-the-art in technologies of contemporary and future electronics and optoelectronics. In fundamental science the research appeals to world-class scientists working on topics of interaction physics that seek answers to questions that are at current frontiers. The project offers opportunities to highly qualified undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdocs interested in participation in research at frontiers of condensed matter science.",
