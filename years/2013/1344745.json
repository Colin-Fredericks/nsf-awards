 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:  The objective of this program is to understand and develop scalable nanomaterial-based wet-coating processes that enable high-throughput, cost-effective roll-to-roll production of an organic solar cell integrated with a composite supercapacitor that simultaneously harvests and stores solar energy.  The proposed device and processes have the potential to transform energy applications by dramatically decreasing costs and increasing the adoption of solar energy; lowering dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing climate change.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:  The intellectual merit is a deeper understanding of producing high-performance polymer solar cells/nanowire electrodes and supercapacitors with low-temperature, high-throughput, wet coating processes.  A systematic approach with interdisciplinary researchers from the basic materials level to the manufacturing process level provides the intellectual basis for the project. Barriers to high performance organic solar cells, nanowire electrodes and composite supercapacitors are addressed to bring these important components together in an integrated device. The materials and processes involved in the devices are all optimized and/or developed to be compatible with cost-effective roll-to-roll production.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The broader impacts are related to both education and technology.  The knowledge gained from the process development will provide a base for cost-effective solution processing of numerous other nanomaterials and an array of devices beyond those studied in this proposed work, including; organic light-emitting diodes, wearable electronics, flexible sensors, and flexible displays.  This program will also enable nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing enhancements to undergraduate/graduate courses as well as the development of a new course and workshop. It will reach high school students through hands-on research opportunities.",
