The outcomes of this workshop will provide guidance to the EarthCube initiative from the petrology-geochemistry community to design and develop the architecture of an Earth Science cyberinfrastructure that is aligned with the end-users' needs for data and sample access, software tools for data and metadata acquisition, workflow support, data analysis, data visualization, and modeling, computing capabilities, interoperability with data from other domains, as well as policies and procedures that address the scientists' concerns regarding, for example, data sharing, data citation, intellectual property, sample curation, and career advancement. The workshop report will be made widely accessible on the web.",
