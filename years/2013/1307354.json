 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative research project involving a partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Cornell University, and PPG Industries.  It will develop polymers that utilize changes in stress state to mechanically activate -- without human intervention -- chemical reactions that signal the presence of damage and initiate repair wherever and whenever it occurs.  The reduction in waste achieved through lifetime extension will contribute to a sustainable materials landscape. Mechanoresponsive polymers are created by directly linking force-activated molecules (mechanophores) into polymer chains. The complex spatial and temporal changes in stress state that precede damage in polymeric materials promote mechanophore activation, transforming it into a new chemical species for signaling or for initiating productive changes in materials properties.  Realization of mechanochemically based sustainable polymers requires mechanophore motifs with amplified responses that can be activated efficiently. The proposed research entails synthesis of new mechanophores specifically for damage detection and repair, experimental and computational development of force-focusing strategies to achieve efficient force transmission to the mechanophore, and experimental evaluation of materials systems. Elucidating the fundamental, molecular-level mechanisms governing mechanophore response to macroscopic damage in polymers will be advanced through symbiotic combination of modeling and experiments. These scientific advancements will then be applied to the design and experimental evaluation of polymers that self-report and self-heal in response to tension overload, fatigue, and interfacial delamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWaste reduction is key to a sustainable materials landscape. Plastics are ubiquitous industrial materials and their waste reduction is achievable through life extension and recycling. Given the high energy requirements, financial cost, and limited yield of plastic recycling, life extension is critically important to life cycle management.  The proposed research program seeks to develop graded warning and healing systems for industrially relevant plastics. The technical approach relies on the synthesis of plastics with force sensitive molecular units called mechanophores that are activated by damage.  Advances in self-reporting plastics will reduce material consumption and waste by eliminating prescheduled replacements. Self-healing capabilities for plastics can drastically extend the service lifetime of these materials.  This research project will involve the education and training of several graduate students at the University of Illinois and Cornell University. These students will be part of an interdisciplinary research team working in close partnership with PPG Industries, Inc. to translate scientific advances to commercially viable plastics.  The research themes of self-reporting and self-healing for sustainability provide a unique opportunity for education and outreach to the general public.  A series of educational demonstrations, exhibits, and videos will be developed on how materials impact sustainability, with emphasis on zero waste.  These platforms will be widely disseminated over the web and at special public engagement events.",

This collaborative research project has resulted in new experimental and computational tools to support the development of sustainable plastics that self-report the presence of damage and potentially initiate self-repair wherever and whenever it occurs. Damage-reporting plastics were created by linking force-activated molecules, known as mechanophores, directly into polymer chains or by anchoring the mechanophores at an interface between a rigid reinforcement (such as silica) and a polymer matrix. The application of force or initiation of damage in the plastic transforms the mechanophore into a new chemical species for signaling or for initiating productive changes in materials properties. A critical challenge for this project work was to impart self-reporting properties to high stiffness, high durability plastics, typical of materials used for coatings or other structural applications.</p>\n<p>Our first accomplishment was the discovery of a new color-changing mechanophore, naphthopyran (NP), thus adding to the library of force sensitive molecules. We systematically studied the effects of how the molecular attachment of the mechanophores to the polymer chains in the plastic influenced activation.&nbsp; The NP mechanohores were incorporated in bulk polymer and characterized under tensile force. Importantly for the development of self-reporting plastics, the NP mechanophore changed to a bright yellow color upon application of force (Figure 1). The mechanophore response was also analyzed using CoGEF molecular level calculations.&nbsp; &nbsp;We found that&nbsp;although CoGEF is a promising tool for rational design of mechanophores, there are additional effects such as electronic structure that also play an important role in mechanophore activation and design.</p>\n<p>A second key accomplishment was the development of force-focusing strategies to give better control over mechanophore activation in plastics, composites and coatings. &nbsp;We hypothesized that attaching the mechanophores to a rigid interface will lead to activation at lower forces, providing an important tool for controlling mechanophore activity. New experimental and computational tools were developed for probing mechanophore activation at an interface. &nbsp;We successfully demonstrated the activation of maleimide-anthracene (MA) mechanophores at the interface between a patterened epoxy film and a fused silica subrate (Figure 2) as well as the activation of mechanophores at the interface of polymers and nanoparticles (Figure 3). &nbsp;As hypothesized, we found that mechanophores linked to an interface require less strain and less stress for mechanical activation than in bulk linear polymers.&nbsp;This result opens promising design routes for self-reporting composite materials.</p>\n<p>A new method of mechanochemical activation by mechanical scanning probe lithography (m-SPL) was also demonstrated.
