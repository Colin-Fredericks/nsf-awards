Sprays are widely used to reduce the level of particles in air in applications such as pollution control and dust control in mines.  However micron scale particles are very difficult to remove from the air using sprays, and so significant levels of these micron scale particles exist even when sprays are vigorously implemented.  An acoustic radiation force exists whenever a sound wave interacts with an object.  In this work the acoustic radiation force from ultrasonic waves is used to force particles and drops to come into contact with each other thereby scavenging, or removing, these particles from the air.  The goal is to cause greater scavenging of micron-scale particles than would have existed without the use of ultrasonics.\r\n  \r\nSeveral theories for the acoustic radiation force exist, however there are significant disagreements between these theories.  This is a significant issue, since without a theory, any attempts to improve the scavenging of particles using acoustics will be forced to rely on a time-consuming trial and error approach.  Accordingly, the first step in this project is to experimentally validate and correct a theory.  This will be a significant result in and of itself.  This result will also be used to guide further experimentation in this project to show how to best improve scavenging of micron-scale particles by sprays using ultrasonics.  An especially important goal of this project will be to determine if the acoustic radiation force should be configured to act on both particles and drops, forcing them into a small region, thereby increasing the scavenging of particles, or alternatively (or in addition), to use the acoustic radiation force to make the particles combine with each other, causing them to more easily be removed. \r\n\r\nParticles that are on the order of one micron in size (about one-fiftieth of the diameter of a human  hair) are very dangerous to the pulmonary health of human beings.  This is of concern for two reasons.  Firstly, particles in this range are very difficult for the human body to reject.  Particles larger than a micron tend to be blocked in the pharynx and upper respiratory system, while particles much smaller than a micron may be exhaled after entering the lung.  However, particles that are about one micron in in size tend to make it all the way into the alveolar region of our lung, and then stay there.  Water sprays are often used to help eliminate particles from the air.  For example, devices called wet scrubbers are used in smokestacks to reduce the level of particulate pollutants.  However, due to technical reasons, water sprays are not very good at eliminating particles that have a size on the order of a micron, leading to the second point of concern which is that sprays are good at removing particles that are much larger than or much smaller than a micron, but not those on the order of a micron.  Hence, micron size particles can cause lung damage, and sprays are not very good at keeping them out of the air that we breathe.  In this project, ultrasonic sound waves (acoustic energy just outside of the range of human hearing) are being used to improve the ability of sprays do remove particles from the air.  By using high intensity ultrasound, particles and spray drops can be pushed into close proximity to each other, enabling the drops to remove the dangerous particles in a way that would not otherwise occur.  The potential importance of this work is that it may be implemented in smoke stacks, automobile and truck exhaust systems, the cabs of mining vehicles, and in underground mines.  In this way, the technology developed in this project may be used to reduce the level of particles in the air, thereby reducing the incidence of lung ailments such as asthma, lung cancer and COPD.",

The overarching goal of this research was to facilitate the development of methods for improved removal of pollutant particles from exhaust sources such as smokestacks and vehicle exhuasts.  Specifically, the goal was to demonstrate how ultrasonics (sound outside the range of human hearing) can be combined with fine water mist (fog) to enhance the removal of particulate pollutants. \n\nThe project was successful and showed that very significant increases in the removal of particles can be achieved by flowing partice-laden air into an ultrasonic standing wave field in the presence of fog.  This was studied in two configurations: a field established between two disks, and a cyldindrical ultrasonic standing wave field.  In all cases, the fog was generated also using an ultrasonic source.  For the cylindrical case, as many as 95% of the particles were removed. \n\nIn order to enable the further development of the above results, and to ultimately enable their transition to actual applications, a theory of the acoustic radiation force is required.  Such theories exist, but there were discrepancies among those theories.  Prime among these discrepancies was the fact that some theories predicted a change in the sign of the acoustic radiation force at a critical diameter, while others predicted no such sign change.  We conducted experiments which tested for this sign change, showing that such a sign change does indeed exist.  This is a significant intellectual development and will facilitate further theoretical developments of the acoustic radiation force which will, in turn, facilitate further development of the devices studied herein, enabling their deployment as commercial scrubbers capable of effectively removing particlulate pollutants from exhaust. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John R Saylor"
