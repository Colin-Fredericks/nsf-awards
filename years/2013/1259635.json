 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Odyssey III Scholarship Program is designed to strengthen the infrastructure of the computer science and mathematics programs at Mississippi Valley State University.  Program activities are designed to capitalize on the academic gains made by computer science and mathematics majors during the last decade and to transform these gains into increased academic aspirations, particularly graduate school attendance.  The program assists the University in creating an environment which equips and prepares students with skills that contribute to their success in graduate school and increases the pipeline of underrepresented minority students entering the workforce with graduate STEM degrees. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the program goal of providing stronger support for student aspirations to pursue graduate studies, program activities include a) active recruitment of students to participate in research internships; b) engagement in student development activities which facilitate graduate school admission such as GRE preparation and preparation of graduate school applications and statements of interest; c) early engagement in professional development activities such as freshman conference attendance, d) active engagement in conference research presentations by sophomores, juniors and seniors; and e) faculty-led initiatives that increase the awareness of graduate school requirements.  The desired outcome of program activities is an increase in the pursuit and completion of graduate degrees by the programs' primarily African American student population, who are underrepresented in STEM",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to provide experiences for undergraduate STEM students that influenced them to pursue graduate STEM degrees.  Activities of the project exposed students to environments on and off the University's campus which allowed them to network with graduate school faculty members.  Students who showed an interest in graduate education were persuaded by University faculty members to apply for REUs and research laboratories as well as participate in research projects on the campus of MVSU.   During the duration of this project, students participated in several local, state, regional and national conferences that allowed them to disseminate findings from their research.   The areas that are supported by this project has shown an increase in the number of students who apply to graduate STEM programs and subsequently enroll in those programs.\n\nTo provide assistance with students research experiences, faculty members began to acquire mini-grants which allowed undergraduate students the opportunity to perform research.  All (100%) of full-time faculty members within the department guided research projects for undergraduate students.\n\nThe student population of MVSU is primarily African-American.  Data shows that in STEM disciplines, the percentage of African-Americans who pursue and inevitably receive a STEM degree has been the lowest among all races/ethnicities.  This project assisted in increasing the number of African-American students who obtained STEM degrees.  Official reports identify that STEM education is important to the US Economic future.  By providing an avenue to increase the number of African-Americans pursuing STEM fields increases the number of STEM-trained professionals which provides assistance in supplying trained professions for current and future STEM-related careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Holston"
