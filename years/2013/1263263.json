 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Kent State University (KSU; with The Holden Arboretum (HA) near Cleveland) that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013 to 2015. The program focuses on terrestrial-aquatic linkages within urban-impacted environments. Student research will be conducted at several field sites around KSU and HA that are impacted to varying degrees by human activities such as urbanization, industry, farming, mining, and recreation. Early in the program, training and cohort activities will take place at both KSU and HA, including field trips and workshops that use active-learning exercises. Skills emphasized will include ethics training and responsible conduct of research, generating testable hypotheses, communicating science to diverse audiences, and involving non-scientists in research. Cohort activities will encourage students to work in teams, communicate, analyze the quality of their data, and archive data in a geospatial database. Students will then conduct research mentored by faculty with wide ranging expertise in terrestrial and aquatic ecology. These projects could include examining how human activities affect the flow of nutrients within and between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, change microbial community composition, or contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Weekly reading/discussion groups will bring participants and mentors together to further student-student and student-mentor interactions while fostering the communication skills necessary for a successful science career. Participants will be recruited from both U.S. colleges and universities and local two-year colleges (Cuyahoga Community College, Lakeland Community College, KSU's regional campuses) with a high proportion of students from underrepresented groups that often do not continue their education. Participant selection will occur based on student qualifications, statement of interest and recommendation letters. Participants will be tracked using a web page, blog and Facebook page and through followup surveys. Information about the program will be assessed by an external assessor and using an REU common assessment tool. For more information visit http://ecologyREU.kent.edu, or contact the PI (Dr. Patrick Lorch at plorch@kent.edu) or co-PI (Dr. Kurt Smemo at ksmemo@holdenarb.org).",

The program was built around the theme of aquatic-terrestrial interactions in environments that have been affected/impacted by urbanization. As part of this REU Site, we recruited a diverse array of students (including students from groups underrepresented in STEM careers) from two-year colleges (which generally have limited research opportunities) and four-year colleges and universities. Through a multi-pronged approach (using workshops, presentations, mentored individual and collaborative research projects, and field experiences), the students gained substantive experience in the effective conduct of scientific research. Student training included, but was not limited to, workshops on ethics in science, application of the scientific method, generating questions and hypotheses, experimental design, the use of technology in research, and designing and presenting oral/poster presentations. As an aside, the workshops and their associated materials developed for the REU are now being used at Kent State University to inspire our students to pursue research, graduate school, and STEM careers; by repurposing this material, we have brought an added benefit to students at our own institution. With respect to the REU itself, this approach resulted in students conducting independent research projects working closely with a mentor from Kent State University, Holden Arboretum, or Cleveland MetroParks. Additionally, they also gained research experience through collaboration on focused, cohort-driven research projects, learning the benefits of team-based work, while honing their new research skills, preparing them further for future careers in the STEM pipeline. Along with workshops, the REU program incorporated significant amounts of field experience for each cohort, through organized field trips to northeastern Ohio ecosystems with linked aquatic-terrestrial systems differing in types and degrees of impairment resulting from urban impacts. These field trips allowed students to see the magnitude and diversity of urban impacts in these ecosystems, particularly with respect to streams and rivers. Many of these sites had also experienced restoration/remediation efforts with varying levels of success, giving students a sense of management options and factors influencing the likelihood of restoration. An added benefit of all of these activities was that students met and interacted with both academic and applied scientists, providing additional mentoring and networking opportunities for the REU participants. It also increased their comfort level and confidence relative to talking with scientists and other practitioners, which will pay benefits in any future interactions and/or research opportunities they pursue. Overall, through this suite of research projects, workshops, and field trips, student gained a deeper understanding of the scientific process, which increased their interest and confidence in attending graduate or professional school, with the goal of ultimately pursuing careers in science and other STEM fields. To help them follow this path, we gave a workshop on preparing for, applying to, and choosing a graduate school, which was well-received. In fact, the majority of our students (participating in this REU across all three cohorts) plan to or have already gone on to graduate or professional school. In terms of the research conducted by the REU students, it has resulted in presentations and publications, and has also enhanced research efforts and directions associated with their mentor&rsquo;s labs. Further, student research and mentor collaborations from the REU have allowed for the potential of synergistic, interdisciplinary research efforts among folks who interacted during the REU. Overall, our REU students gained a lot from the structure/approaches used in this program, and through their research efforts, their mentors and host labs gained as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Kershner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
