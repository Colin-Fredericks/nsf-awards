 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northeast Ethics Education Partnership (NEEP) program, managed by Brown University's Center for Environmental Studies, provides training to graduate students in research ethics, cultural relativity, and community-based approaches.  NEEP offers this training through semester-long courses and student/faculty mentoring, as well as through an extensive training database of slide presentations on 30 topics in research ethics, cultural competence and community-based research.  Through this award, the project team is expanding NEEP training from its current partnership (Brown University and SUNY-ESF) to include Northeastern University and UMASS-Dartmouth.  One goal of this expansion is to conduct short/long courses with their engineering schools, and environmental studies and marine science departments. National dissemination of the NEEP website training materials is being promoted and a research survey to identify research ethical/cultural relativity issues of concern in environmental field research is being conducted with environmental studies researchers,  environmental anthropologists/sociologists and engineers. Ethics training is being provided to a diverse community of minority and underserved students and women scientists through the large, racially-diverse populations being served by UMASS and Northeastern University programs.",
