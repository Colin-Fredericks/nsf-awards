 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Iowa Museum of Natural History to connect it to the existing InvertNet Thematic Collections Network by digitizing approximately 28,000 insect and crayfish specimens from the museum's zoological research collections. Capturing 2D and 3D images and digitizing irreplaceable data will ensure long-term data preservation and make collection information accessible online to scientists, educators, students, and the public. Museum collections are crucial to modern biological research, and historic specimens are especially necessary in studying the effects of environmental and land use change.  However, the fragility of these specimens and the scattered location of collections can make using them in research difficult and inefficient.  Digitizing images and data makes specimen information more visible and accessible, increasing the potential for new research and public understanding.\r\n\r\nIn concert with digitization, the museum will integrate public education with InvertNet research by creating a \"traveling trunk\" for educators on the theme of invertebrates in the Midwest, updating an existing exhibit on arthropods to include content from the InvertNet project, and developing a traveling exhibit that can be borrowed by schools, nature centers, museums, and other groups in the region. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

This project joined UIMNH to a network of 22 other museums and collections creating a large database of photos and information about Midwestern arthropod collections. Our goal was to photograph our entire collections of insects and crayfish and transfer photos and data about these collections to the national databases InvertNet and iDigBio. We photographed 336 drawers of insects, more than 44,000 specimens total, using a robotic high-resolution camera developed by other institutions in the network. The robot automatically took and stitched together an array of 320 individual photos for each drawer, efficiently generating giga-pixel images in which even small insects can be seen in detail. We photographed 281 groups of crayfish, most from multiple views, using a digital SLR camera and lightbox. These photographs and information about when, where, and how the specimens were collected have been sent to shared, multi-institution online databases, where they will be easily searchable and permanently available to scientists and members of the public.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts: </strong>Many museum visitors are unaware of the vast holdings of natural history collections and their importance for modern scientific research. Having digitized information on our collections available online makes it easier to share them with our visitors and the general public. In addition, we created a touchscreen-based digital exhibit about our insect and crayfish collections for the University of Iowa Mobile Museum, which had more than 33,000 visitors in 2017. We also created more in-depth touchscreen exhibits about our collections and their scientific importance for use in the Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s own Biosphere Discovery Hub, and designed a new exhibit on arthropod ecology and evolution for a section of the museum focused on the diversity of life. Museum educators created a traveling education trunk about insects, with content tied to state K-12 science standards, that is available for loan to educators, parents, and others throughout Iowa. Undergraduate students performed much of the data transcription and photography on this project, giving them valuable professional experience with crucial concepts in modern museum collections management.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/13/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Trina&nbsp;E&nbsp;Roberts</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1303840/1303840_10238934_1507066562333_SUI-Ins-Hymenop-12-smaller-landscape--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1303840/1303840_10238934_1507066562333_SUI-Ins-Hymenop-12-smaller-landscape--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example insect drawer photograph\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1303840/1303840_10238934_1507066562333_SUI-Ins-Hymenop-12-smaller-landscape--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example insect drawer photograph\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reduced-resolution photo of a drawer of the insect order Hymenoptera, showing the array of 320 images stitched together for each drawer.
