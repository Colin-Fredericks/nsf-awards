 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a single-celled fertilized egg into a multi-cellular adult is an essential part of animal life cycles.  Morphogenesis, a critical component of development, is the process by which embryonic structures are molded to generate the final adult form.  Morphogenesis is driven by changes in the migration and shape of embryonic cells and tissues.  While much is known about the processes that change cells during morphogenesis, very little is known about how these processes are regulated to ensure that they occur in the correct time and place.   This research focuses on discovering novel genes and regulatory mechanisms that mediate morphogenesis.  To accomplish this, the project team uses the remodeling of the tail of C. elegans males as a model of morphogenesis.  Male tail remodeling provides a unique system for identifying novel morphogenetic genes and regulatory mechanisms because: i) C. elegans is remarkably easy to manipulate genetically, ii) tail remodeling  involves changes in only four cells, and iii) DMD-3, a conserved regulatory protein, is known to be the master regulator of this process.  It is expected that, upon completion of this research, the project team will characterize the role of intracellular vesicular trafficking in male tail morphogenesis, identify novel genes and processes involved in morphogenesis, and characterize how DMD-3 controls these genes and processes.  The experiments will be carried out by undergraduate students working in the research laboratory or taking a Developmental Genetics course.  This project will provide students with experience using current genetic and cell biological techniques and will introduce them to C. elegans, one of the preeminent invertebrate genetic model systems.  In summary, this study will link aspects of cell biology, genetics, and developmental biology to provide a detailed description of morphogenesis in C. elegans, and inform our understanding of similar processes in vertebrates.",

Morphogenesis, the focus of this project, involves the structural changes that occur in cells and tissues that function to mold the adult body form and construct organs during organogenesis.  Morphogenesis is driven at the cellular level by changes in cell shape, adhesion, migration and fusion.  These cellular changes are controlled by effector genes that exert their influence directly on cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, etc.  Importantly, our understanding of the downstream effectors of morphogenesis is still incomplete, especially at the level of linking these effectors to upstream regulatory mechanisms. \n\nThe focus of this research project was to characterize the morphogenetic processes that generate sex-differences in tail shape in the nematode C. elegans.   The male tail is blunt ended and contains sensory structures that the male utilizes during mating.  In contrast, the hermaphrodite tail is pointed [Fig. 1A].   The difference in tail shape is due to a male-specific morphogenetic process that occurs during the last larval stage.  This process involves sex-specific changes in cell biological processes that cause the tail tip to migrate forward (a process called tail tip retraction).\n\n We discovered that DMD-3, a conserved transcription factor, is both necessary and sufficient for activating the morphogenetic program that causes the male tail to retract [Fig.1B].  Current experimental evidence suggests a \"bow-tie\" regulatory model in which multiple signaling pathways converge upon DMD-3, (and MAB-3, a similar protein), to drive expression male-specifically in the tail tip [Fig.1B].  DMD-3 activates the expression of \"effector genes\" that carry out morphogenesis by directly change the cell biology of the tail tip cells.  The goal of this project was two-fold: 1. To establish \"tools\" that we can use to visualize the cell biological changes that occur in the tail tip during retraction and 2.To discover effector genes that are regulated by DMD-3 activity.\n\n         We have generated C. elegans strains that we can use to analyze cell biological changes during tail tip retraction [Fig. 2].   We have made strains that express protein fused to a red fluorescent molecule that localize to organelles involved in vesicular trafficking [Fig. 2A].  In addition, we also generated transgenic strains that allow us to visualize changes in the actin cytoskeleton during tail tip retraction [Fig. 2B].  Since preliminary experiments clearly indicate that both processes are important for tail tip retraction, these strains will allow us to assess how these change during tail tip retraction in both normal and mutant males.\n\n         To identify downstream effectors of DMD-3, we performed a large-scale analysis to identify all the genes expressed in male tail tips.  This approach has identified ~600 potential candidate DMD-3 effector genes. A major focus of my lab has been to determine the expression patterns of these candidate genes by generating and analyzing the expression of GFP reporter transgenes [Fig. 3].   Through this process we have identified three genes that are expressed male-specifically dependent on MAB-3 / DMD-3 activity.\n\n         The first gene, sqv-4 [Fig. 4], is involved in chondroitin biosynthesis.  Chondroitin has been suggested to be important for multiple morphogenetic events during animal development.  Despite this, the exact mechanisms by which chondroitin synthesis is regulated are well understood.  Our work demonstrates that chondroitin synthesis in the male tail tip is, at least partially, regulated by the transcriptional activation of the sqv-4 gene by MAB-3 / DMD-3. \n\n         The second gene, T07A5.1 [Fig. 5], is an uncharacterized, conserved gene.

However, expression analysis of T05H10.3 and its paralogs strongly suggests that this gene plays an important role in the cessation of male tail tip retraction.        \n\n         Another goal of the project was to train future scientists. During this granting period, 31 undergraduate students and two high-school student were involved in this project.  Twenty-two of the trainees were women and four were from groups underrepresented in science.  In addition, three of these students presented this work at scientific conferences.  In addition, experiments from this project were also included in the laboratory portions of two of my upper level courses, allowing an additional 47 students to be exposed to a primary research experience as an undergraduate.  Research on this program helped expose students on exciting new molecular genetic techniques, including Gibson Assembly and CRISPR / CAS genome editing.  Finally, I presented parts of this research to a 9th grade Honors Biology classes at a local high school as part of my presentation on CRISPR / CAS genome editing.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: D.
