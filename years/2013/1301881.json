 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasmas (i.e., charged, ionized gases) are pervasive.  From stellar nurseries to the Earth's ionosphere, plasmas represent a fourth state of matter that is the most common form of matter in the visible universe.  Moreover, a phenomenon known as a \"dusty\" or \"complex\" plasma is formed when charged particulate matter, such as dust or ices, becomes incorporated in the plasma environment.  In space, phenomena such as in comet tails or the rings of Saturn are examples of dusty plasmas.  Closer to Earth, control over particulates in plasmas are important in high-technology and microelectronic fabrication.  In both astrophysical and technological plasmas, the presence of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the properties of the plasma.  This research project supports a new, state-of-the-art, multi-user, superconducting, high-magnetic device to understand the basic properties of a strongly magnetized plasmas and magnetized dusty plasma.  The intellectual merit of this work is that it will enable the study of new regimes of plasma physics and dusty plasma physics that have not been accessible in previous experiments.  The main project goal is to investigate how the structural, thermal, charging, and stability properties of a dusty plasma evolve as the system is taken from an unmagnetized state through a progression of regimes where first the electrons, then the ions, and then charged microparticles become magnetized.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work is substantial.  This project is a direct collaboration among three US universities (Auburn University, The University of Iowa, and University of California-San Diego) that perform leading research in the field of dusty plasmas.  The researchers from these three organizations will coordinate a broad team of collaborators representing universities, national laboratories, and international partners.  And, this project will provide excellent opportunities to train the next generation of plasma scientists through the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as providing partnerships with dusty plasma researchers at predominantly undergraduate institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF award supported undergraduate student research as part of a joint NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering Project entitled, \"Collaborative Research: Physics of Magnetized Dusty Plasmas\".  The intellectual merit of this work was centered on new investigations of the interaction between charged microparticles and strongly magnetized plasmas.  This portion was largely funded through the Department of Energy.  The research activities focused on the use of the Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiment (MDPX) device &ndash; a multi-user, superconducting, high magnetic field (B &gt; 4 T), research device at Auburn University.  Experiments performed using the MDPX device led to observations of modified wave structures, enhanced particle flows, and the first observations of a new type of ordered structure in a dusty plasma.  The NSF portion of the funding was used for broader impact; specifically, support for five undergraduate research students in a combination of experimental and computational projects.  The simulations performed by the students used a molecular dynamics code to model the transport of the charged microparticles in strongly magnetized plasmas.  This work provided insights into the dynamics of particle flows at high magnetic field.  The experimental studies allowed us to evaluate the performance of laser manipulation and high speed imaging diagnostics for future application to studies on the MDPX device.  Students were able to learn foundational laboratory and computational research skills, engage in scientific discussions with faculty and graduate students, and make presentations at scientific conferences.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward E Thomas"
