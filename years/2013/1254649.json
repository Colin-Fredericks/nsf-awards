 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms for enhancing optical nonlinearity in subwavelength metallic nanostructures. The approach is: (1) to examine the nonlinearity enhancement in subwavelength metal-nonlinear dielectric grating systems; (2) to develop an effective medium (metamaterial) description to assess the enhancement and to predict new optical phenomena; and (3) to investigate the fundamental limit of the enhancement and to explore the dependence of enhancement on grating geometry. The success of this proposal will be transformative to optical science, providing a viable mechanism for enhancing and tailoring the optical nonlinearity to create multi-functional nonlinear optical materials.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Recent advances in artificially created inhomogeneous composite materials have established the opportunity for synthesis of new classes of material that will enable new families of linear and nonlinear nanophotonic devices. The PI will examine the mechanisms for extraordinary enhancement of optical nonlinearity in nano-structures and the applications. The research findings of this proposal will make possible ultra-compact, ultrafast, and energy-efficient nonlinear optical devices for optical switching and modulation to prepare for future demands for broadband signal processing.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This research program presents an approach to develop novel nonlinear artificially engineered material structures. The interdisciplinary science and engineering training and education will also involve working with minority, women and K-12 teachers and students. The PI participates in a technology outreach program, and will further contribute to general public science awareness programs through outreach activities.",
