 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data centers worldwide use approximately 30 billion watts of electricity\r\nwith data centers in the United States using approximately 8 to 10\r\nbillion watts. Power consumption of datacenter systems is expected to\r\ncontinue to grow both absolutely and as a percentage of national\r\nconsumption. The goal of the proposed research is to develop massively\r\nparallel processor arrays that work in conjunction with traditional\r\nenterprise-class processors to compute datacenter workloads with vastly\r\ngreater efficiency. The proposed research may lead to new applications\r\nand capabilities that were previously constrained by power dissipation\r\nor processing throughput.\r\n\r\nProject participants will propose, model, develop, and characterize\r\nnovel fine-grain many-core architectures, VLSI chip designs, and\r\napplication algorithms for a processor array serving as a co-processor\r\nor functional unit. The proposed programmable fine-grained many-core\r\nprocessor array contains no algorithm-specific hardware and is of a core\r\ngranularity that is very lightly explored in prior work. The array will\r\noperate inside or near, and in co-ordination with a host\r\nenterprise-class processor and compute key computational kernels often\r\nwith similar or higher performance than the host processor, but with\r\norders of magnitude higher energy efficiency. During kernel computation,\r\nthe host processor could attend to other tasks or enter a low power\r\nstate. The targeted workloads include sorting, regular expression based\r\npattern matching, encryption, data compression, video encoding and\r\ndecoding, and other enterprise workloads of high impact that are\r\ndiscovered during the course of the research.",
