 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  The 2013 RNA Upstate NY Conference will be held October 25-26, 2013 at the Inn on the Lake, Canandaigua, NY.  The objective of this conference is to assemble a diverse group of scientists from the northeastern United States that is actively involved in a broad range of research on the biology of RNA, to present and discuss recent findings, evolving methodologies, and future scientific directions and challenges.  The field of RNA Biology has greatly expanded over recent years and RNA is now known to be involved in regulating metabolism and gene expression in all forms of life.  The Specific Aims of the meeting are to:  1. Provide a venue for the exchange of ideas among researchers from the northeastern United States with interests in the role of RNA in biology.  2. Encourage the participation in RNA research careers of graduate and postdoctoral students, as well as women, under-represented minorities and person with disabilities.  3. Enhance future communication and collaboration among regional scientists working in the field of RNA biology.  The site of the conference will allow easy access by regional scientists, thereby encouraging the participation of graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs and junior level researchers.  The conference will enhance the cross fertilization of interdisciplinary ideas by organizing presentations along thematic lines that represent cutting edge research in the field of RNA biology.  The format of the meeting will include four keynote speakers in different areas of RNA biology and additional speakers, chosen from the students and post-docs who submit abstracts for the meeting.  Those not chosen for talks will present their work in poster form.  Time is allowed in the meeting schedule for formal as well as informal interactions.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  One important goal of this conference is to enhance the dissemination of new scientific results, ideas and techniques in current use in the field among students, junior faculty and experts in the field. This is especially important this year as the annual RNA Society Meeting is being held in Switzerland, beyond the fiscal reach of many junior laboratory members. Thus, the conference will facilitate the participation of scientists with broad experience in this rapidly advancing field.  The organizers will choose speakers from submitted abstracts, ensuring that students and postdocs deliver the majority of platform presentations, and will balance the gender and ethnic diversity of the participants. The previous RNA Upstate RNA Conference participation included about 25% women and at least 2% under-represented minorities. Four of the sixteen platform speakers were women, as were 16 of the 64 poster presenters. The organizers expect to exceed these numbers, if possible, and to ensure the seamless participation of persons with disabilities.",
