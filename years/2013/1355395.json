PACE, a coalition of the ACM, the Association of Information Systems, IEEE-Computer Society, Computer Science Teachers Association, the Computing Research Association, and the National Center for Women & IT, is dedicated to improving the preparation of the computing workforce.  Through discussion among leading computing and education researchers, we propose to achieve the following goals:\r\n(i) to develop a shared understanding of the state of computing education research across subdisciplines\r\nof computing, identifying gaps and overlaps;\r\n(ii) to identify present strengths and future opportunities for research on computing education;\r\n(iii) to assess the viability of building mechanisms for improved infrastructure, such as a research coordination network, and\r\n(iv) to encourage knowledge sharing across the fragmented domains of study.\r\n",
