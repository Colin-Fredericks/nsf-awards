 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chickasaw (ISO 639-3 code: [cic]), is a severely endangered language in the Muskogean family, with 70 or so fluent first language speakers remaining.  The Muskogean languages have extraordinarily complex verbs, especially with regard to the intersection of their morphology (word structure) and phonology (sound system).   Chickasaw is prosodically complex, with long vowels, geminate consonants, laryngeals (consonants produced with constriction near the glottis), pitch accent, nasalization and rhythmic lengthening, all of which intersect with a rich morphology that includes prefixes, suffixes and an elaborate system of internal changes known as verb grades.   This project will investigate these elements of Muskogean verbs.  Verb morphology is vulnerable to loss through language attrition and since all of the Muskogean languages are either highly endangered or no longer spoken, it is important to document the verb information now.\r\n\r\nThe project is a unique collaboration between the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program (CLRP) located in Ada, Oklahoma, and The University of Texas at Arlington. Linguist Colleen Fitzgerald of UT Arlington and CLRP Director Joshua Hinson have designed a documentation project that will increase our understanding of the Chickasaw verb and make available a significantly-sized database of verbs, both in number of verbs and in the number of inflected forms per verb. This project will collect verbs in paradigms and connected speech (e.g. narratives). Analyzing paradigms will increase knowledge of Muskogean verbal structure, theoretically important for linguistics. Documenting and analyzing texts will record Chickasaw speakers' traditional knowledge and experiences in context, essential to indigenous language revitalization.",

Accomplishments for this award include the collection of approximately 11 hours of digital audio recordings of narrative and conversation data in Chickasaw and 7 hours of HD digital video recordings of Chickasaw conversation data. During the time period, fieldwork and data collection of Chickasaw verbs included: structured elicitations, elicitations using stimuli, narrative and conversation documentation, and professional-grade, multimedia studio HD recording of several group conversation sessions of fluent speakers. There are also numerous transcriptions in ELAN and texts entered in FLEx. Curation of this major data set is ongoing and copies will be archived with the Native American Language Collection at the University of Oklahoma's Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and with Chickasaw Nation's own tribal archives.</p>\n<p>This project has advanced knowledge of the complex morphological and phonological structure of Chickasaw, it has created a substantial and rich documentary record of recordings and metadata, and it has created a searchable corpus of annotations for a portion of the recordings. Analysis of the process of community-based language research has been disseminated through publications (Fitzgerald and Hinson 2013, 2016; Fitzgerald 2018, 2020), including a dissertation (Hinson 2019). Linguistic analysis of Chickasaw has also been disseminated through publications (Fitzgerald 2016, 2017c). Research was also disseminated through an invited plenary address at the Linguistic Society of America Annual Meeting (Fitzgerald 2017a). Conference presentations and publications also continue to be generated</p>\n<p>Thanks to the generosity of Chickasaw elders, who have shared their knowledge of the language, the project recorded fluent speakers' traditional knowledge and experiences in context, essential to indigenous language revitalization.

Language documentation and the associated intellectual content was produced for a critically endangered Native American language. Activities increased opportunities in social science research for Native Americans, who are highly underrepresented in linguistics and social science. THE NSF-DEL grant products, in particular recordings of fluent speaker narratives, have had broader impacts in support of Chickasaw language revitalization. Specifically, they have been utilized in departmental efforts including the Chikasha Academy Adult Immersion Program and Rosetta Stone Chickasaw. The CLRP has taken these fluent speaker narratives and modified them into progressively more grammatically advanced stories in a beginner, intermediate, and advanced version for each narrative. These are used as vehicles for language acquisition in the immersion environment. Additionally, the program has created simplified versions of native speaker narratives and have animated them for use in Rosetta Stone Chickasaw. In addition, both PIs (Fitzgerald and Hinson) have shared their experiences and knowledge on this project with other academics and tribal citizens through presentations, formal and informal networking, and trainings.</p>\n<p class=\"Refs\">Fitzgerald, Colleen M. &amp; Joshua D.
