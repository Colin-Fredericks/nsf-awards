 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Benjamin Arbuckle will direct three years of multi-disciplinary, international field and lab research at four sites in central Turkey. This project brings together an international team of researchers from the US, Canada, Turkey, France and Germany with specialties in archaeology, zooarchaeology, paleogenetics, isotope biochemistry and paleobotany to provide the first comprehensive picture of the history of Asiatic ass and wild horse hunting and the subsequent emergence of domestic horses in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of the horse represents one of the most important technological achievements of the ancient world and revolutionized strategies of subsistence exchange, interaction and warfare across the Old World. Although the history of horse domestication in the steppic regions of western Eurasia is slowly coming into greater focus, the origins of the domestic horse in the Near East continues to represent a major archaeological puzzle. Although it has long been acknowledged on geographic grounds that ancient Turkey may have played an important role in the transmission of domestic horses into the Middle East, few data have been available to adequately test these hypotheses, and the social and biological processes responsible for the origins of domestic horses in the Greater Near East remain obscure. \r\n\r\nThrough an innovative combination of archaeological, genetic and isotopic datasets this project will build a detailed interpretive framework that will 1) define the nature of the newly discovered patterns of intensive wild horse and Asiatic ass hunting on the Anatolian plateau, 2) evaluate the roles of local domestication versus importation in the appearance of domestic horses in the region, and 3) understand the social processes responsible for the origins of domestic horses. By applying a powerful combination of methods to newly available archaeological assemblages rich in horse remains, this project has the potential to provide a radically new perspective on the origins of the domestic horse, one of the most important innovations of the ancient world. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research is multidisciplinary in scope. It will significantly impact research addressing the process of animal domestication and the transmission of innovative technologies, both major topics of archaeological and anthropological inquiry. It will also provide new insights into the history and origins of equines, and will add to the understanding of the biodiversity of an important livestock species. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the study are that it will support international cooperation and collaboration between American, French, German, Canadian and Turkish researchers across multiple disciplines. It will also provide support for training a graduate student and will help support the development of innovative research methods in paleogenetics as well as archaeology. Results will be made accessible via open access web publications, ensuring the broadest possible impact.",

Despite the central role of horses in shaping human history, the history of domestic horses themselves, and particularly their origins, has remained a mystery largely because the wild ancestor of domestic horses is extinct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have made three significant discoveries in our exploration of humans and prehistoric horses. First, our archaeological results have shown that there is a long tradition of intensive hunting of native wild horses and a now-extinct wild ass in central Turkey between 8000-3000 BC. We have been able to provide the first detailed descriptions of this ancient tradition of equid hunting as well as the genetic and morphological characteristics of the populations of wild horses and asses themselves which were previously largely unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, our results strongly suggest that domestic horses were imported into the region now known as Turkey&mdash;rather than independently domesticated there&mdash;by at least the third millennium BC and perhaps as early as the 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC probably from north of the Black Sea (modern Russia and Ukraine). However, we identified local Anatolian wild horse maternal lineages in domestic horses at Bronze and Iron Age sites (3000-1000 BC) indicating that local wild horses were widely incorporated into the incoming domestic herds. These ancient native wild horse lineages are still present in Middle Eastern domestic horse populations and this discovery is potentially important for identifying and protecting this valuable and ancient genetic heritage present in some modern horses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, we have uncovered evidence for the late survival of the now extinct Anatolian wild ass into the early second millennium BC in central Turkey. This is the latest attestation of this important grazing animal anywhere in the world prior to its extinction and provides important information concerning one the most recent extinctions of a large mammal. Moreover, we also have genetic evidence that Anatolian wild asses were captured, raised, and hybridized with domestic donkeys in the third and early second millennia BC to produce a hybrid animal known in ancient texts as a <em>kunga</em>. This equid hybrid was perhaps the most highly valued animal in the last centuries of the third millennium BC and was used by Bronze Age elites in Iraq, Syria (and now we know also Turkey) to pull wheeled vehicles in military campaigns (a local precursor to the horse and chariot technology of the following millennium). Our results represent the first biological evidence for this wild ass x donkey hybrid and emphasize the high level of technical knowledge accrued by ancient equid hunters, wranglers, and herders and the intensive nature of the interaction between humans and both wild and domestic equids in the ancient world.</p>\n<p>Although this project has successfully addressed its primary goals, our discoveries have led to additional questions that we must continue to explore. A high priority is connecting the importation of early domestic horses into ancient Turkey with archaeological evidence for migration and exchange across and around the Black Sea to better understand the sources and mechanisms for the movement of these animals. In addition, the fact that domestic horses appear in Turkey in the third and perhaps even fourth millennium BC, yet were not widely incorporated into Middle Eastern political and economic systems until the second millennium BC, requires that we further explore the cultural and/or biological factors responsible for this early reticence in the adoption of what would become the most important animal in human history.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Benjamin&nbsp;Arbuckle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1311551/1311551_10284169_1536935116394_CD5021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1311551/1311551_10284169_1536935116394_CD5021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CD5021.
