 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Permanent Magnet Material\r\nAbstract\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop compact, high torque density, energy-efficient, rare-earth-material-free electric machines for alternative energy and transportation applications. The approach is to use the concept of transverse flux paths with the unconventional \"ring\" winding that allows the increase of pole numbers without the reduction of ampere-turn per pole. The goals of this research will be achieved through electromagnetic, structural and thermal design, analysis and optimization followed by fabrication and testing of a 50kW prototype electric drive. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed transverse flux machine has a modular structure that uses the flux focusing technique to increase air-gap flux density without having to use high flux density materials. The modularity of poles allows for easy assembly and scalability of the machine. The double windings per module or phase open the door for developing innovative control methodologies.  The structure has high stator core utilization, and high fault tolerance capability, which are highly desirable features in traction machines and wind generators. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n The research will establish designs and design methodologies for high torque and power density electric machines without using expensive rare-earth magnet materials. The practical and lower cost machines to be designed will promote alternative transportation and increase the penetration rate of renewable energy harvesting technologies. The research will establish the US foothold in the area of compact, high-torque motors facilitating gearless electromechanical systems. The comprehensive educational plan built with lecture and laboratory modules on alternative energy and transportation will help train many graduate and undergraduate students.",
