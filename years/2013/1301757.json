 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystal growth from high temperature solutions is used to create new oxide materials with complex structures and desirable luminescent properties.  Several approaches to the crystal growth from high temperature solutions are being pursued to create different classes of luminescent materials for solid-state lighting applications, including the use of high temperature solutions to grow new complex rare earth containing oxides for solid state lighting and upconversion applications; and the use of fluxes stable under highly reducing conditions for the crystal growth of complex Eu2+ containing phosphors. In addition, this research investigates the process of crystal growth in fluxes using in-situ at the Diamond beam line in the UK, aiming to reveal the materialization of intermediates that are typically neither observed nor isolated, and the formation of the final product. In the short term, the information gained from the in-situ work is used to optimize the crystal growth experiments, while in the long run this understanding transforms flux crystal growth from an empirical method to a more deliberate process.\r\n\r\nThe area of solid state lighting materials is focused on the development of energetically more efficient and visually more pleasing light emitting phosphors.    To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting-edge techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of the art instrumentation.  This project provides education and research training to students (including women and underrepresented minorities) and helps to prepare a skilled workforce for academia and industry.",
