A week-long workshop on the applications of succinct data representations to Big Data analysis  will bring together about forty mathematicians and computer scientists to exchange ideas about, and share current work on, succinct representations of data enabling sophisticated analysis, as in compressed sensing and streaming, sparsification, distributed sensing and data fusion, machine learning, optimization and complex query processing.\u00a0 The workshop will be in cooperation with the Simons Institute on the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley, and will take place on September 16-20 2013, during the Institute's semester-long program on algorithmic foundations of big data analysis, thus also engaging in its work the (more than thirty) participants of that program.  The workshop will be open to all potential participants and the findings and video tapes of presentations will be distributed to the public for comments and engagements.",
