 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop integrated design and optimization of wireless cooperative networks for practical source signals. Unlike traditional approaches based on idealized Gaussian input assumption,  this project takes into full account the practical constraint of finite-alphabet input signals and data security consideration against eavesdropping. The fundamental nature of this study should lead to new discoveries in wireless networking, optimization, and PHY layer security.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Merit:\r\n\r\nThe technical merit lies the development and optimization of novel integrated transmission precoders and receivers for various wireless multi-antenna configurations including cooperative and wiretap channels by focusing on practical input signals from finite alphabet sources.  This investigation emphasizes effective design integration and joint optimization of these wireless configurations such as cooperative multi-antennas, multi-user cooperative systems, and packet retransmission diversity schemes. The project?s novel approach to wireless system design integration represents a fundamental and practical design paradigm shift that truly transcends both physical and data link layers to achieve high spectral efficiency, reliability, and secrecy.  Important technical contributions include investigation of centralized and distributed cooperative transceiver optimization and relevant open problems under non-Gaussian discrete input signals and passive eavesdropping, under incomplete or uncertain channel state information.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe project's broad impacts include new research directions, new tools, and results that can influence research and development in other science and engineering fields. The research findings would impact the quality of future wireless services and broaden their applications in practical environment where quality of service, spectral efficiency, and confidentiality concerns are paramount.",
