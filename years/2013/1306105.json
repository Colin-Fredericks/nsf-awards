The conferences are being held in Shenzhen, China in February 2013.  These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of architecture, compilers and parallel programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.",
