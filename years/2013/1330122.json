 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project will demonstrate a sustainable wavelength selective energy producing greenhouse covering that will provide a second harvest of electricity for greenhouse growers of vegetables and flowers. The greenhouse uses a proprietary method to selectively absorb only the green portion of the solar spectrum that is not used by plants and utilize this light to generate electricity. Plant growth is helped by controlling the spectrum of the light for most efficient growth. This cost effective and highly durable greenhouse cover will be tested in a commercial greenhouse growing environment. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the energy required to produce food in the United States and lower the carbon footprint for greenhouse grown products. The greenhouse covering will help the rapidly growing local food industry by improving the economics of small scale greenhouse production and save natural resources by growing food close to where it is consumed. The commercialization of this product will create a completely new energy source that can pay for itself in 5 years and can also provide fresh flowers and vegetables to local consumers.",

The intellectural merit of this project is a semi-transparent greenhouse roof panel that generates electricity AND benefits plant growth. By integrating solar energy production above crop production, GIPV allows growers to utilize on-site energy resources, without compromising valuable land area and crop production. The dual use of the greenhouse and PV structure decreases balance of system (BOS) costs for retrofits of our GIPV products relative to conventional solar. Renewable energy incentives can be applied to the combined greenhouse structure and solar panels to reduce the capital cost of the greenhouse &ndash; a major pain point for the implementation of high efficiency and sustainable greenhouse crop production. Soliculture uses technology developed and patented from the University of California - Santa Cruz in 2011 from the physics laboratories of Prof. Sue Carter and Prof. Glenn Alers. A luminescent dye is used to convert solar wavelengths that are not beneficial for plant growth to wavelengths that can facilitate plant growth and can generate electricity. Soliculture has been focused on crop production trials in commercial greenhouses since 2010 to determine the optimized light spectrum for combined electricity production and plant growth. The broader impact of this work is the creation of Soliculture, founded in 2012 by Prof. Glenn Alers with the help of the NSF I-Corp program. In 2013 an NSF Phase I award was able to demonstrate the technology in small research scale greenhouses and initial commercial greenhouses. Soliculture received a phase II NSF SBIR award in 2014 that was used to turn the concept into a commercially viable product. In 2015, Soliculture entered into a strategic partnership with Solaria Inc. in Fremont, CA who brought in the Si cell singulation and stringing technology to make the panels manufacturable in high volume. Leveraging standard solar industry manufacturing methods with a proprietary luminescent polymer layer and patented advanced singulation technology from Solaria, Soliculture has the only GIPV panel on the market that can produce electricity AND benefit plant growth. The product is compatible with standard cSi manufacturing and can be produced at any number of cSi solar contract manufacturing sites, eliminating the need for large capital expenses. Soliculture&rsquo;s GIPV products achieved commercial availability in Q2 of 2015 with their first 10kW installation in Watsonville, CA. Soliculture is currently marketing a combined crop cover / power generation product to open up the market for new greenhouses and new crops with combined power generation and agriculture. Soliculutrue has six trial and commercial installations in California and Alberta, Canada.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Glenn&nbsp;Alers</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1330122/1330122_10272107_1467732348963_logoplant7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1330122/1330122_10272107_1467732348963_logoplant7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LOGO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1330122/1330122_10272107_1467732348963_logoplant7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LOGO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imag...",
