 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban environments lie at the core of many major environmental issues. Much of the human burden of 'greenhouse' gases (GHGs: CH4, CO2 and others) and pollutants (e.g. CO, black carbon aerosol, volatile organic compounds, NOx) emitted globally originate in cities.  Urban dwellers are also exposed to radiatively important pollutants and toxic substances and their associated health risks. Scientists must be able to understand and predict the distribution of emitted species originating within urban atmospheres in order to assess the validity of emissions inventories, the efficacy of emission reduction programs, and the exposure of urban populations to associated pollutants. \r\n\r\nThis MRI acquisition seeks integration of three components of a sensor network:\r\n1. FTIR SOLAR-TRACKING SPECTROMETERS. Three automated solar tracking Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometers will be deployed to make accurate measurements of total column amounts of GHGs including H2O. \r\n2. LIDAR. A Pulsed LiDAR will be acquired to determine time-height cross sections of fine particles and hydrometeors, providing key data to test meteorological simulations of the urban dome \r\n3. An existing solar-tracking VIS-UV spectrometer (acquired at no cost to this project) will also provide time series of total column O3, NO2, H2O and H2CO species, which are reactive atmsopheric components.\r\n\r\nComprehensive measurements of total column, surface, and vertically resolved distributions of these chemical species will be assimilated into a very high resolution model-data framework, enabling a more accurate and complete understanding of regional rates of emission, production, transport, and transformation of these pollutants and GHGs. The model that will be developed and validated using the network will provide a variety of societal (economic, policy) benefits, initially for Boston, and applicable to other similar urban centers. \r\n\r\nElements of an existing surface urban network have already established educational and outreach activities with local (Boston) officials, and has engaged graduate and undergraduate students interested in urban issues in which they live. Real-time data access as an educational tool to engage the public more broadly is intended. All data collected in the network will be available for download by the public in near real time, and as soon as QA and QC checks are completed.",
