SIGACT (the ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory) applied for and was granted the award.  \n\nThe funds provided by this award supported 15 students, from a range of different institutions and educational backgrounds, to attend STOC 2013.  The award provided support towards registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.  The students who received support included ones who had papers at the conference as well as students  who did not.  It is commonly more difficult for students in the latter group to obtain travel support from their local institution, so the award made it possible for a number of students to attend STOC who likely would not otherwise have been able to attend.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the award consists in its having enabled a broad group of students to be exposed to cutting-edge research across a broad range of topics in theoretical computer science.  The broader impacts of the awards consist in its giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional and social exchanges that STOC fosters.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rocco A Servedio"
