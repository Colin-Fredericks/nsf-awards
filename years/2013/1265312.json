Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union.  The meeting will be held in Reykjavik, Iceland March 10-15, 2013. The sessions will last 5 days. Three main questions will be considered: (1) How to magnetotails form? (2) Once energy and mass enter the magnetotail what modes operate? (3) How do magnetotails affect the inner magnetospheres and ionospheres? The meeting will consider the terrestrial and planetary (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) magnetotails.",

Magnetotails are the site for many dynamic processes critical to \nthe circulation of mass, energy and magnetic flux. The great differences in \nsolar wind conditions, planetary rotation rates, ionospheric conductivity, and \nphysical dimensions from Mercury\u00c6s small magnetosphere to the giant \nmagnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn provide an outstanding opportunity to \nextend our understanding of the influence of these factors on these basic \nprocesses.  \nIn recent years there has been an explosion of observations from \nspacecraft missions, such as MESSENGER, Geotail, Cluster, THEMIS, Galileo, New Horizons, Cassini, and ARTEMIS to name but a few.
