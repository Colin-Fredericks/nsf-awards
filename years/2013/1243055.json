 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some dinoflagellates (small unicellular marine organisms) are bioluminescent; they have the ability to emit flashes of light, a beautiful and spectacular sight in the ocean. This project will explore the potential role of voltage gated proton channel (HV) proteins in bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and test their physiological role in bioluminescence. The location of the channel proteins in scintillons (the light emitting organelles of these dinoflagellates) will be examined, as well as their biophysical properties as proton channels. This project explores a novel aspect of dinoflagellate biology and provides an excellent model in which to study the general mechanism of proton selective transport, which is an essential aspect of the processes of photosynthesis and respiration. \r\nBroader impact:  This project will generate knowledge of the basic biology of the dinoflagellates, some of which are responsible for toxic \"red tides\" whilst those that are bioluminescent create threats of exposure for night-time naval operations involving divers, swimmers and underwater vehicles. This project will provide a unique opportunity to train a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of molecular biology, biophysics and marine science.",

Forty years ago, the first suggestion that a HV1 proton channel should exist came in the context of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates, one type of marine algae.  In that work, J.

We showed that the gene coded for a bona fide HV1 protein and characterized its properties.  We isolated scintillons from L. polyedrum and used fluorescently labeled antibodies to show that the HV1 of L. polyedrum localizes to the scintillon as predicted. \n\n \n\nIn addition to achieving our original research objectives, we also used this grant to survey data made available by MMETSP and showed that HV1 is present in many dinoflagellates, most of which are not bioluminescent.  This suggests that HV1 has a function in dinoflagellate biology separate from bioluminescence; because of HV1?s known role in controlling cellular pH in other marine algae, we believe the most likely function is the same in dinoflagellates.  Understanding the mechanisms by which cells regulate pH is important for understanding, predicting, and responding to the effects of an acidifying ocean.  It is also important for optimizing the use of marine algae in biotechnological applications such as the production of fuels, drugs, and vitamins. \n\n \n\nFifteen undergraduate students at Kennesaw State University and two graduate students (one at Kennesaw, one at University of Maryland) helped perform this research.

Importantly, two of the students were primarily engaged in bioinformatics projects.  This grant has thus made a significant impact on developing the US workforce capacity for continuing advances in the life sciences.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan M Smith"
