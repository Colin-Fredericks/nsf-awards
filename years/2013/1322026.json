 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, at the University of Toledo, creates an I-Corps Site at an institution that has a track-record in moving projects from the lab to commercialization. The UT entrepreneurial efforts focus on students and involves coaching, mentoring and innovation curriculum. In addition, this institution will designate physical space to the I-Corps Sites activity. This new I-Corps Site builds on the University of Toledo?s Innovation Enterprises (UTIE) which developed a technology commercialization paradigm called ?Lab to Launch.? Lab to launch engages stakeholders at various points along the tech transfer, prototyping, commercialization, seed/venture funding and market entry continuum of business creation. The UT Site is student-centric and there is strong integration of faculty-student interactions. The facilities currently provided, and that will be expanded, are substantial and provide a strong foundation for an I-Corps Site. In addition, the broader impacts may be significant, impacting on economic development in the region and matching well to the mission of the I-Corps Site goals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n UT now has a self-sustaining iCorps program, and there is a growing culture that favors start-ups.  Many engineering students now favor start-ups over traditional jobs on graduation.\nSpread iCorps methods through training of faculty researchers (59), students (308) and community members (70), which has helped inculcate the customer discovery process at UT.\nFaculty inceasingy apply for NSF National program, and follow-on funding (STTR/SBIR, iCorps on Ohio and Ohio Third Frontier).\nFour(4) start-up companines were formed from this iCorp initiative.  Presently, none have recieved investments, but venture funding is expected in the near future.  \nTwenty (20) mentors were develped from the program.  \nAn iCorps simulation game was designed, and will become part of the future training program once it is ready for release.  This design was used as a basis for a sales simulaton game, which has now been used for four (4) semesters in the college of business curriculum.  Simulation games are a great way to provide the customer interaction process on a virtual basis.  \nThere has been a growth of infrastructure and technology to support the program.  This includes fab labs, maker spaces and some very advanced 3D printing capabilities.  UT has leading skills in 3D/VR, which allows the teams to visualize their models virtually, and then print them.  This is very powerful for the new product development process.  \nGraduates of this program have obtained $2.1M in follow-on grants.  \nThe program has had a positive impact on the UT start-up community, and helped support the UT deal flow.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Mccreary"
