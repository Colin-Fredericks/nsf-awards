 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of today's computational capability is housed in massive cloud computing infrastructures sometimes known as \"Warehouse Scale Computers.\"  This transition has given rise to a new class of emerging applications that run on hundreds of thousands of powerful cores, and access petabytes or exabytes of storage; these applications include web search, media streaming, big data analysis, etc. This centralization of the world's computing means that inefficiencies in those systems are magnified to a high degree -- in other words, if we can improve the efficiency of those systems, we measurably improve the efficiency (improve performance, reduce energy drain) of the world's computing infrastructure. This research addresses several sources of inefficiency, including increasingly inaccurate assumptions of hardware homogeneity, unpredictable interference between applications, and poor models of low-level resource sharing. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses these inefficiencies by (1) creating a heterogeneity-aware execution framework for cloud platforms that not only accounts for the heterogeneous capabilities of the hardware that are expected to increase over time, but intentionally employs heterogeneity (at multiple levels) to improve efficiency in running diverse workloads; (2) creating a holistic runtime system for shared resource management that accounts for resource sharing at all levels, including low-level sharing on CMPs and multithreaded cores, allowing threads to be more aggressively co-scheduled; and (3) creating new precise prediction models for performance and quality of service that can drive more intelligent scheduling decisions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDatacenters currently sponsor a dominant portion of the world?s business and personal computational capability, and consume a significant fraction of the world?s energy.  Computational efficiency in these datacenters is critical to advancing our ability to solve key problems, and yet do so with reduced impact on our environment.\n\nThis research addressed many challenges to datacenter efficiency.  These include.\n\nDatacenters must co-locate diverse jobs, and doing so is inherently efficient.  But this raises key challenges.  This work demonstrated the ability to precisely estimate performance implications of application interference (both same-processor interference and same core, via SMT, interference), precise power accounting of interference.\n\nThis research demonstrated the performance and security advantages of heterogeneous architectures that employ cores that run distinct instruction set architectures.  It demonstrated that the cost of cross-ISA migration could be reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to prior solutions.  Next it showed that such an architecture provides significant efficiency advantages, with as much as 21% performance gain and 23% energy gains over the best possible single-ISA heterogeneous design.\n\nAdditionally, this work demonstrates significant security advantages of multi-ISA heterogeneous architectures.  Such an architecture can address a wide array of security attacks, which fall under the broad label of Return-Oriented Programming, by frequently (in face of a possible attack) switching between cores with distinct ISAs.  In this way, we can execute traditional code seamlessly, but make it nearly impossible for code that exploits unintentional control to execute intended or useful computation.\n\nThis research further extended the heterogeneous-ISA compilation and runtime infrastructure to work on a real IBM datacenter across diverse machines.\n\nThis research introduces DjiNN, an open infrastructure for DNN as a service in WSCs, and Tonic Suite, a suite of 7 end-to-end applications that span image, speech, and language processing.  It used DjiNN to design a high throughput DNN system based on massive GPU server designs and provide insights as to the varying characteristics across applications.  This improves DNN throughput by over 120x for all but one application (40x for Facial Recognition) on an NVIDIA K40 GPU.\n\nThis project  proposes the use of phase change materials (PCMs) to temporarily store the heat generated by the servers of a datacenter during peak load. The ability to store heat allows the system to shape the thermal behavior of the datacenter, releasing the heat only when it is advantageous to do so.

Due to the high worldwide demand for datacenter-based power, any reduction in energy consumption will have noticeable effect on world energy resources and environmental impacts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dean M Tullsen"
