 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP) is a collaborative alliance of nine institutions, including two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and three two-year institutions. The overarching goal of ARK-LSAMP is to increase the pool of baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) disciplines entering Arkansas? workforce. The Alliance maintains its commitment to the overarching goal of this transformative initiative through objectives that will continue to increase the number of STEM graduates, as well as implement best practices learned from initial NSF funding. A summer Bridge program prepares first semester freshmen to successfully navigate the transition to college level coursework. Mentoring programs provide peer mentoring (upper-level student to lower-level student) as well as faculty mentoring. Summer and academic year research in faculty laboratories provide extracurricular involvement in research at the forefront of STEM. In addition to undergraduate STEM programs, the Alliance continues to focus on increasing graduate STEM scholars with a STEM seminar series providing training in research ethics, information on STEM careers, STEM in society, and preparation for graduate school. In response to NSF priorities, a veteran student focus will be added to the program. An existing and well-established veterans program at a member institution will serve as the best practice model. Alliance-wide and inter-institutional conferences and activities will foster greater collaborative research among faculty across institutions.",

The overall goal of ARK-LSAMP was to increase the number of underrepresented minorities who major, graduate and obtain positions in Arkansas and the national workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).&nbsp; The Alliance is extremely proud of our partnership with the Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC) former the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority (ASTA) over the last ten years which has allowed us to continuously support our students throughout their undergraduate careers.&nbsp; The impact of a program of this magnitude has had profound benefits for the state of Arkansas, our region and the nation.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">ARK-LSAMP is composed of eight colleges and universities all located within the state of Arkansas.&nbsp; The Alliance is strengthened by its commonality and by its diversity.&nbsp; There are seven public and one private institution including three 2-year community colleges, one 4-year college and four universities.&nbsp; The participating institutions were: Arkansas State University (ASU); Philander Smith College (PSC); Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas; Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK); University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (UAF); University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR); University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB), the lead institution; and University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College (UA-PTC).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expected outcome of ARK-LSAMP was to help Arkansas join other states in the region in the national initiative to strengthen America?s competitiveness and diversity in STEM. This was achieved through a well-coordinated set of educational, research and training enrichment activities on each campus resulting from collaborative engagement in planning for curricula enhancement, internships, guest lectures, attendance and presentations at professional meetings/conferences and other STEM-related activities. Particular emphasis was on select STEM disciplines such as biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, engineering, plant and animal science. Each ARK-LSAMP member campus was able to offer STEM enhancement programs for its ARK-LSAMP participants.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>ARK-LSAMP was guided overall by four objectives in the proposal from 2013-2019: The four main objectives of this project were: 1) increase the number of underrepresented (URM) STEM majors; 2) increase the number of URM STEM baccalaureate degree completers; 3) increase the number of URM STEM bachelor?s degree recipients who enter STEM graduate programs; and 4) develop a component on each Alliance campus to identify, recruit and support veterans who are STEM majors.&nbsp; Our two most important outcomes have been the successful implementation of our Pre-First Year Summer Institute and our Annual Spring Research Conference.&nbsp; The best practices learned from our summer institute include the advantage of cohort grouping and learning communities during the academic year.&nbsp; At our Annual Spring Research Conference, students showcase the outcomes of ARK-LSAMP learned each year through summer and on-campus research opportunities.&nbsp; Students are given an opportunity to present and receive STEM research data. &nbsp;Also at the conference, a model is presented for ARK-LSAMP participants for a professional STEM research presentation.&nbsp; Additionally, student participants are given an opportunity to gain knowledge on applying for internships and graduate schools.&nbsp; Moreover, student participants are allowed to further facilitate networking and team-building among ARK-LSAMP students, staff, administrators, advisory board members, and funding agencies.</p>\n<p>Under this proposal cycle, ARK-LSAMP has had fifty (50) graduates in STEM disciplines from all four of the 4-year campuses.&nbsp; A total of four graduates from 2-year campuses transferred to 4-year alliance member campuses.&nbsp; Twenty-five students have gone on to graduate school at Howard University, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, University of Arkansas, Arkansas State University, Drexel University, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, UT Health San Antonio and several have joined the workforce in a STEM-related area at companies such as Wal-Mart, Northrup Grumman, Procter &amp; Gamble, GE Aviation and Eaton Corporation.&nbsp; The ARK-LSAMP consistently places at least thirty-forty (30-40) students in summer research experiences and internships each year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:

The impact of a program of this magnitude has had profound benefits for the state of Arkansas, our region and the nation.\n \nARK-LSAMP is composed of eight colleges and universities all located within the state of Arkansas.  The Alliance is strengthened by its commonality and by its diversity.  There are seven public and one private institution including three 2-year community colleges, one 4-year college and four universities.  The participating institutions were: Arkansas State University (ASU); Philander Smith College (PSC); Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas; Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK); University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (UAF); University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR); University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB), the lead institution; and University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College (UA-PTC).\n\n \n\nThe expected outcome of ARK-LSAMP was to help Arkansas join other states in the region in the national initiative to strengthen America?s competitiveness and diversity in STEM.
