 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to establish phylogenetic relationships among members of the important beetle family Zopheridae using DNA sequence data, and utilize this information to test long-standing hypotheses surrounding the biogeography of the southern hemisphere. We will sequence DNA from zopherids from around the world, perform phylogenetic analyses, and test biogeographic hypotheses. Knowledge of Zopheridae biogeography will complement ongoing research using other taxa such as mammals and higher plants, and has potential to inform several scientific disciplines outside systematics and phylogenetics, including geology and paleoclimatology.\r\n \r\nRecovered biogeographic inferences will provide important biodiversity data for use in the management of sensitive environments in the southern hemisphere. In an educational capacity, the PIs will mentor at least one undergrad student as part of this project.  The student will be directly involved in the project and will gain experience in insect systematics, thus fostering the student's desire to enter a graduate program in science. This project will enhance the Co-PIs professional development through strengthened multi-institution, multi-nationality collaborations with top experts in the field and better position him to obtain a tenure-track faculty position in insect systematics.",
