 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to stimulate interest in cybersecurity competitions through the development of a visualization and broadcast system targeted to enhancing learning and understanding among spectators. The system engages the spectator by presenting information pertinent to understanding the real-time details of the game in a usable and spirited manner. It accomplishes this through the combination of various techniques, including real-time network security visualization, live video and audio monitoring, animation, computer graphics and commentary. As a result, the project improves the educational value and excitement for the spectator and broaden interest in the field of cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThe proposed tool captures computer and network activities for all the competing teams and present them in a user-friendly manner for the benefit of the spectator using state-of-the-art broadcasting, animation and commentary. Although visualization has been utilized at large-scale cyber defense competition, such as the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, it is still used only in a limited way. Further, it does not target the spectator in a serious way and it is rarely used for small-scale cyber defense competitions, which is the main target of this project. \r\n\r\nBy improving the spectator experience, more students are attracted to collegiate cyber defense competitions and ultimately to cyber security related fields. The tool is also beneficial to competition participants, especially to student teams who could use the tool for network security visualization.",

The stated purpose of these competitions is education, and the goal is to help students better defend computer systems and networks against attacks. However, the number of student participants engaged in these competitions has remained relatively small, especially among underrepresented minorities. One of the reasons for this lack of interest may be attributed to the fact that, to date, the competitions have been beneficial mainly to participants?student teams, judges, administrators, etc. However, for a spectator of the sport, the excitement and educational value do not necessarily transfer. We hypothesize that this is mainly due to the challenge associated with the spectator's ability to extract, visualize and comprehend the details of the game as it transpires in real-time.

To support this goal, we have designed LUCID, a comprehensive visualization software application for cyber security visualization and commentary. The application consists of five component types: components for monitoring network traffic, components for reporting various network messages, data storage components, and a visualization component. Additionally, it has an automated animation reporting component. LUCID can serve as an aid in teaching complex concepts in cybersecurity in the classroom or to visually demonstrate active security events on a network to an audience (or to participants) in a cyber-defense competition in near real-time. LUCID's flexibility enables it to visualize different cybersecurity concepts, protocols, and ideas.
