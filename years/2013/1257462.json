 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principles underlying the process of adaptive evolution are well established, and have been well tested in the laboratory and over short time periods in the field. However, we also know that the long-term rate of adaptation can be subject to additional processes. The primary objective of this research is to examine how a population's genetic variability affects the rate of adaptation over many generations, in the face of variation in environmental conditions and the depletion of that genetic variation by natural selection. Quantitative genetic experiments will be conducted in nature to assess potential and realized adaptation for three populations of the annual plant species, Chamaecrista fasciculata (partridge pea).\r\n\r\nThis research will establish an empirical basis for predicting rates of ongoing adaptation.  Beyond their fundamental importance, rates of adaptation are now of urgent societal importance in the context of rapidly changing climate. This research will inform policy and efforts directed toward conservation of natural populations. Moreover, the project will contribute to development of scientific capability by involving undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scholars, including members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields.",
