 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting three cohorts of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in electrical engineering at Suffolk University. Scholar recruitment is being done in partnership with the Boston Public High School system, with additional support from local power industries. Cohort-building and developmental activities for scholars build on best practices from other institutions and include a project-based first-year seminar, enrichment and career-development sessions, course-affiliated study groups, faculty and peer mentoring, and internship opportunities. The intellectual merit of the project lies in a cohesive and focused approach to scholar recruitment, retention and career transitions which leverages strong participation by high schools and industry and the supportive community of electrical-engineering students and faculty at Suffolk. The broader impacts include expanding and diversifying the power-industry workforce, as well as providing a well-assessed model for consideration by similar institutions.",
