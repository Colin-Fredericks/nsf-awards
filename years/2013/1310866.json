 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds David Linz of Miami University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Center for Developmental Biology (RIKEN) in Kobe, Japan.  The project title is \"Beetles in Flight: Using RNA Sequencing to Analyze Stag Beetle Wing Development.\" The host scientist is Dr. Shigeo Hayashi.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of the evolutionarily integral wing structures (elytra) in the coleopteran insects (beetles). The elytra of beetles have been a driving force in the impressive evolutionary success of these insects by providing a protective armoring over the dorsal surface. This project provides the first detailed documentation of these wing structures in a Japanese stag beetle, Dorcus hopei. RNA sequencing techniques along with gene knockdown are also implemented to elucidate the molecular basis of the elytron evolution in these beetles.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the stag beetle is an immensely popular animal in Japanese culture. Often, young adults and children raise the beetles as pets. By initiating the scientific study of such an organism, this project will simultaneously catalyze an interest in science itself among youthful collectors. The CDB in Japan, where this research will be performed, provides open house sessions to the public. Upon completion of the project, findings will be presented during these events as an opportunity for excited stag beetle enthusiasts to learn about project outcomes.  Miami University in Ohio also has close connections with the Talawanda School District in the same city. In order to have a more global impact, experiences during this project will be presented to Talawanda school science classes upon completion of the work. By sharing experiences in Japanese culture and science, this project provides an example to students of the international engagement that scientific study can offer. The project also aims to spur an interest in insects and their role in studying evolution and hopes to thereby spawn a scientific fascination among students.",
