 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site program offers an 8-week mentored summer research experience in data-intensive computing for 10 undergraduate students  in the School of Computing at Clemson University.  Data-intensive research, characterized by the need to efficiently acquire, store, transmit, manipulate, visualize, search, and analyze massive data sets, is increasingly pervasive in all areas of science and industry.  By leveraging Clemson's strength in cyber-infrastructure, a talented pool of faculty mentors, and synergy with an existing NSF-funded program for incoming graduate students in this broad research area, this REU Site aims to (1) expose undergraduates to cutting-edge research in data-intensive computing, (2) provide a detailed instructional program covering the tools and technologies used in this domain, and (3) motivate participants to pursue further advanced study at the graduate level.\r\n\r\nMany research projects within this program are highly interdisciplinary in nature, with potential impact within as well as outside the field of computing. The program will contribute to the national talent pool of students with highly-sought skills in data-driven computing research, ultimately feeding both a growing area of graduate computing study, and a crucial sector of the computing workforce.  In addition, the program will also strive to broaden participation in computing by actively recruiting women and students from other under-represented groups, as well as students from institutions with limited resources for providing research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
