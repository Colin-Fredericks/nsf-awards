 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET 1336719\r\nEllis, Brian R.\r\nUniversity of Michigan Ann Arbor\r\n\r\nRecent advances in directional drilling and well stimulation techniques have made extraction of natural gas and oil from shale formations economically viable via high-volume hydraulic fracturing.  A side effect of hydraulic fracturing is the exposure of previously hydraulically isolated minerals that may contain naturally occurring radioactive material and toxic metal elements.  These constituents may be released into the fracturing fluids that flow back to the surface, which must be properly handled to avoid contamination of fresh water resources.  The primary objective of this study is to characterize the interactions between the hydraulic fracturing fluid and organic-rich shales in order to determine the potential for hydraulic fracturing fluid chemicals to mobilize undesirable trace toxic metal and radionuclide flowback fluid constituents.  While flowback fluids are expected to be contaminated to some degree, e.g., it is known that these fluids may be highly saline and contain elevated levels of trace toxic metals and radioactive elements, the potential for these contaminants to be leached as a function of the shale composition, down-hole conditions, and chemical additives present in hydraulic fracturing fluid formulations has not yet been determined.  To address this knowledge gap, a series of batch and flow-through experiments will be performed to assess the impact of these parameters on contaminant leaching.  Experiments will be conducted on natural shale rock samples from two Michigan shale gas reservoirs, under typical in situ temperature and pressure conditions encountered in the field.  Unique and state-of-the art high temperature and pressure apparatuses will be constructed for this research and used to development standardized methods for evaluating the chemical processes and mechanisms controlling the release of inorganic toxic and radioactive elements from organic-rich shales in contact with hydraulic fracturing fluids in the subsurface.\r\n\r\nCurrent efforts to assess flowback water quality rely on the analysis of the water once it has returned to the surface. To properly address or dismiss concerns regarding water quality impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing, a better understanding of the chemical evolution of hydraulic fracturing fluids in the subsurface is required.  The results of this study will help guide industry best practices for sustainably developing domestic shale gas resources and for reducing potential water quality impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing well completions.  Furthermore, understanding the chemical evolution of the injected fluids will aid in forming sound regulatory policy addressing flowback water management practices, including treatment, reuse and disposal.",

Experimental studies evaluated a simplified set of typical chemical additives used during hydraulic fracturing completions including acid, metal chelator, and oxidizing compounds.  These synthetic fracturing fluids were brought into contact with powdered rock samples and fractured rock cores from several Michigan Basin shale gas formations to investigate the chemical and mass transport controls on element leaching from the gas-bearing shales.  All experiments were conducted under relevant reservoir temperature and pressure conditions.  Batch experiments demonstrated that low pH conditions caused by the addition of strong acids in fracturing fluids had the largest impact on element mobilization.  The addition of oxidants, often added as gel-breakers in hydraulic fracturing fluids, further enhanced the dissolution of reduced mineral phases such as pyrite, and concomitant release of arsenic (As) and uranium (U).\n\n \n\nSeveral core flooding flow-through studies were carried out following the completion of the batch experiments to better understand the impact of chemical versus hydrologic factors in controlling element release from an intact rock-matrix in fractured shales.  Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray computed tomography helped to identify the development of a calcite-depleted microporous region in the shale matrix adjacent to the main fracture flow pathway in the flow-through experiments.  Continuous calcite dissolution in the depleted regions led to increased exposure and enhanced dissolution of slower reacting minerals like pyrite and concurrent release of the As commonly associated with pyrite.  A 2D reactive transport model was developed to simulate the creation of the depleted zones from calcite dissolution and the role of advective and diffusive mass transport versus dissolution kinetics in controlling the evolution of the depleted regions.  Model results helped to confirm that As leaching was limited by slow pyrite dissolution kinetics and that over time the rate of As release increased due to greater exposure of arsenic-containing pyrite grains in the calcite-depleted zones.  Conversely, calcite dissolution, although initially rate limited by dissolution kinetics, became mass transport limited by the slow diffusion of calcium out of the growing calcite-depleted region adjacent to the main fracture pathway.  These results have illustrated the relative importance of mass transport versus dissolution kinetics in predicting long-term release of trace elements like As from carbonate-rich hydraulically fractured shale reservoirs.\n\n \n\nCompared to the solution composition of flowback water collected from a recently completed shale gas well in the same formation, batch powdered shale leaching experiments did not generate measurable concentrations of some of the toxic elements observed in the flowback water such as radium (Ra).  This motivated an investigation of the primary factors controlling the elevated Ra activity commonly observed in shale gas flowback and produced brines.  Ra activity in produced brine was found to be a function of the U and thorium (Th) content and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of shale, and the total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration in the produced brine.  The shale U/Th content and CEC control the ultimate amount of Ra that may be mobilized from the shale in a given reservoir.  Formation and produced water TDS and sulfate levels directly influence the degree to which Ra is mobilized and its concentrations in produced brine.  The strong correlation between TDS and Ra activity from two different shale formations was used to develop a simple correlation model to predict the expected Ra activity in produced brines.  Knowing a priori when wells are likely to generate produced water with elevated Ra activities based on correlations like those developed in this work will help water quality site managers optimize wastewater treatment and disposal strategies at future shale gas production sites.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian R Ellis"
