Discovered in 1937, the muon (a more massive \"cousin\" of the electron) is a subatomic particle whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a variety of purposes. However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate muons to high energies. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).\n\nSeveral key technologies are needed in order to produce intense muon beams. The way such beams are produced makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a cost-effective accelerator, and the short muon lifetime means that the beams must be reduced in size rather quickly, without losing too many of the muons.

Central to this effort has been a clear understanding of the figure-of-merit for beam cooling, i.e. \"transverse emittance reduction.\"  In addition, suitable spectrometers positioned upstream and downstream of the cooling channel were needed to measure the amount of cooling achieved by a specific channel configuration.  Given the modest amount of cooling expected in MICE and the need to extrapolate the MICE observations to a roughly twenty-fold longer cooling lattice, the quality of the data from the two spectrometers is paramount.  Since the proponents carried out this research in university environments, both undergraduate and graduate students were involved in undertaking both the theoretical and design, as well as the hardware and software development and commissioning, aspects of this research.\n\nOne of the important aspects of this program has been the possibility for students, both undergraduate and graduate, to become involved in forefront accelerator physics research at universities.  There is a significant shortage of trained accelerator physicists and also of students studying accelerator physics.  Research such as this at the participating universities has provided opportunities to involve students in this area of research, thus broadening the population of potential candidates for graduate study in accelerator physics and future employment in universities, national laboratories, and industry.
