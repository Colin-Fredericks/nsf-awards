Scientific contributions include the study of final states with Z bosons and searches for evidence of Supersymmetry.  Technical contributions include maintenance and operations of the Hadron Calorimetry for the CMS detector, and grid computing for CMS physics utilizing the CHEPREO Tier-3 computing facility.   The broader impacts of the program are substantial, from the development of innovative approaches to undergraduate physics instruction at FIU, to the continuing development of a research and education community that includes high school teachers and students in the southern Florida region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project, A Center for High Energy Physics Research and Education, supported the FIU team's research at the CERN laboratory's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.  The FIU group searched for supersymmetric particles (more commonly described as SUSY) which would both explain the mass hierarchy problem of the Standard Model of Physics and form an elegant extension of that Standard Model.  The FIU team uses the hadronic decay of SUSY particles (into, e.g., top quarks) in the search.  This search has been led by the Fermi National Laboratory's reserach team however FIU graduate student Joshi Yagya is using his work on the project as his PhD topic. \n\nJoshi's contributions have been primarily to the data quality monitoring and the data analysis efforts at FNAL.  The grant helped support his time at FNAL and his integration into the analysis team, which led to both the publication of the search results (placing upper limits on the SUSY production process and lower limits on the allowed masses) as well as a conference talk which will be given at the SESAPS conference next week.\n\nThe FIU group (Linn, Markowitz and Martinez) also supported the hadronic calorimater (HCAL) of CMS and in particular the laser calibration system which provides an energy calibration fo the device.  For that purpose, Dr. Martinez has been resident at CERN for the period of the grant to work on the hardware of the experiment and maintain the slow controls for HCAL. \n\nThe experiment itself has been prolific, resulting in not only the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson but additionally hundreds of papers which have tested our understanding of the Standard Model using every possible reaction.  FIU's concentration has been tests of QCD and searches for SUSY.  The QCD tests involve comparing the predictions for vector boson + jets (where the vector boson is either a photon or a Z0) with calculations to search for any deviation from QCD.  Those tests resulted in the PhDs of two FIU graduation students, Luis Lebolo and Vanessa Gaultney.  The SUSY searches (mentioned above) are also a PhD for an FIU graduate student.  FIU has also had four M.S. degrees awarded on CMS (Gary Kaganas, Cris Ceron, Luis Lebolo and Dalgis Mesa) and been used to educate 14 undergraduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pete E Markowitz"
