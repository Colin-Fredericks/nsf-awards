 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the bottleneck caused by the difficulty and expense of designing mixed-signal interface circuits for modern integrated circuits. These interface circuits translate between real-world analog signals and the corresponding digital signals that are processed by digital electronics. A huge challenge is that the cost of designing these mixed-signal interface circuits is skyrocketing and now dominates the overall cost of integrated circuit design. Difficulties in modeling and the worsening manufacturing variability, related to shrinking transistor size, mean that mixed-signal design requires a huge effort. Furthermore, to ensure good manufacturing yield, even the best designs are not optimal in terms of energy efficiency or performance. A fresh new approach is needed. This research investigates a completely new way of creating mixed-signal circuits. In the new approach, the integrated circuit, itself, assembles a mixed-signal function by combining and configuring simple building blocks. An integrated circuit creates a function from an uncommitted set of simple primitives and cells, such as charge-processing cells, comparators and simple amplifiers. This approach pushes design decisions and tradeoffs to each individual integrated circuit. It delivers the best possible solution for a given set of design objectives in the presence of manufacturing variations. It also avoids the need for good models and accurate simulation during design.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is that it addresses the crisis of cost and complexity in mixed-signal integrated-circuit design with a radically new self-design approach. It moves design decisions to the individual integrated circuit, greatly simplifying the design process and removing mixed-signal design from the straightjacket of worst-case design. The broader impact of this research is enhanced with substantial efforts in outreach and education. These include outreach to K-12 students and research experience for undergrads from under-represented minorities. An advanced graduate-level course in analog-digital interfaces will involve graduate students in the research of mixed-signal self-design. To help change the mindset of the next generation of circuit designers, the undergrad major design experience course in analog circuits will introduce students to analog circuit optimization.",
