IISWC is dedicated to the understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems. New applications and programming paradigms continue to emerge as the diversity and performance of computers increase. On the one hand, computing workloads evolve and change with advances in microarchitecture, compilers, programming languages, and networking/communication technologies. This symposium, sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and the Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, will focus on characterizing and understanding modern computer applications commercial and scientific computing.",
