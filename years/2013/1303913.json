  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of this Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, the PI pursued problems in the distribution of prime numbers, elliptic curves, number fields, and automorphic forms; this work resulted in seven publications.  More specifically, in joint work with Soundararajan, the PI investigated the distribution of consecutive primes in arithmetic progressions.  Despite the fact that primes are well-distributed in arithmetic progressions (e.g., each viable last digit occurs its fair share of the time), it turns out that among pairs of consecutive primes there are dramatic biases toward some patterns.  In joint work with Klagsbrun, the PI investigated the limitation of a natural approach to understanding the average rank of elliptic curves in a certain natural family.  In particular, they found that the average size of the 2-Selmer group - a proxy for the rational points on an elliptic curve - is unbounded in the family of elliptic curves with a two-torsion point; this also holds in the family of quadratic twists of such a curve.  This is in contrast to the work of Bhargava and Shankar, who showed that the average size of the 2-Selmer group of all elliptic curves is finite.  Thus, a different approach is needed for this subfamily.  In joint work with Thorner, the PI investigated the distribution of primes with respect to a fixed automorphic form in short intervals.  This yields approximations in short intervals to the celebrated (and now proved) Sato-Tate conjecture.  Finally, in joint work with Thorne, the PI investigated how many primes \"typically\" ramify in a generic number field.  Combining results on the distribution of number fields along with classical methods in analytic number theory, they proved that an Erdos-Kac law holds in this setting.  Thus, the number of ramified primes behaves like the number of prime factors of a random integer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Lemke Oliver"
