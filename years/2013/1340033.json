 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together STEM and STEM education faculty, teachers and administrators from rural districts, and others committed to improving STEM education to develop a partnership to build capacity in Maine to attract, prepare, and support STEM teachers and teacher leaders in high-need rural districts. This partnership fosters a networked improvement community to develop and disseminate exemplary STEM teaching methods courses, preparing both pre-service and in-service teachers to begin the transformation process called for in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics. After conducting a needs assessment of high-need districts, the partnership is using this information to design recruitment strategies, innovative, collaborative field experiences and other professional development to support ongoing professional growth of STEM teachers and teacher leaders, with Master Teaching Fellows earning a Graduate Certificate. These teachers are positioned to have a significant, long term impact on their students and their communities. As information is collected and capacity is built, partnership members are obtaining cost share commitments and agreements for Fellow placements, develop a research and evaluation plan, providing the basis for an NSF Teaching Fellowships and Master Teaching Fellowships proposal. The partnership for this initiative includes researchers with expertise in STEM teaching and learning, veteran teachers, and curriculum directors, each of whom brings different knowledge to the community. The course and curriculum development is informed by discipline-based education research, including studies related to challenges of implementing the practices. Each element of professional development is assessed, with the results used to guide improvements. The project's networked improvement community is providing insights into the use of this strategy for ongoing educational improvement in rural areas. Courses developed through this project are  disseminated broadly, so others benefit from the products of this community.",

In particular, the project supported development of a faculty community in Maine to work collaboratively to carry out evidence-based reforms that improved the quality of pre-service preparation courses. These reforms included revisions of science and mathematics teaching methods courses that aligned those courses with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics. In total, 14 courses were impacted. Members of the faculty community presented in a variety of community forums to share their experiences with aligning pre-service teacher preparation courses to the practices and content of national standards, leading to input and discussion among experienced teachers who offered to support pre-service teacher preparation. Faculty and teachers also collaborated in discussing and developing standards-aligned assessment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Members of this team of faculty and experienced teachers then designed and proposed an NSF Teaching Fellowship Program to recruit, prepare, and retain secondary teachers in the STEM disciplines for high-need rural Maine districts. As part of the design process, researchers conducted a needs assessment, collecting data about the number of teachers who are teaching courses out of field, particularly in Maine&rsquo;s most rural districts. Researchers also looked at the development of teacher leadership and ways that this strategy could enhance the success of a fellowship program.&nbsp; Their proposal was funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program of the National Science Foundation and has currently awarded 13 fellowships, with 9 more fellows to be selected during the coming year. Fellows commit to teaching for at least four years in a high-need Maine district. The fellows are selected from among the students in the Master of Science in Teaching Program at the University of Maine and are afforded a suite of research and teaching experiences during their pre-service preparation program. The fellows benefit from access to the professional community of educators built over the past seven years by the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education (RiSE Center), and are supported by a pool of selected leading teachers in STEM as they strengthen their classroom teaching practice and develop leadership skills. Thus, the fellowship program is building a community of new and experienced teachers to provide leadership in STEM education improvement in the future.</p>\n<p>To further develop the knowledge and skills of rural, experienced teachers in STEM disciplines, the project has also created and proposed a Graduate Certificate Program in STEM Teaching and Learning, to be offered collaboratively by the University of Maine College of Education and Human Development and the RiSE Center. This new graduate program, with a planned launch in the summer of 2018, will offer experienced teachers the opportunity to take many of the courses enhanced through this grant and to participate, for credit, in experiential learning opportunities. These learning opportunities will include projects such as analyzing classroom or school data to identify strengths and weaknesses, working with teams to improve the vertical alignment of curriculum, and working to integrate mathematics with science.</p>\n<p>Faculty members who have been part of this community, working and supporting each other toward achieving a shared goal, have gone on to create other multi-campus communities in Maine using a similar process. Many members of this original small improvement community are now part of the Maine STEM Partnership at the RiSE Center, a statewide STEM education improvement community that has grown out of this and other recent initiatives. &nbsp;Through this larger community, which involves over 1000 STEM educators and education researchers, PK-16+, the course enhancements and teaching and learning strategies developed through this project are disseminated to a much wider audience. This work built expertise in working as an improvement community to solve persistent problems of practice in STEM education and helped develop the community and leadership capacity that have become a crucial aspect of our NSF Teaching Fellowship Program.</p>\n<p>Faculty members involved in this project have given seven related workshops with Maine teachers and have presented talks or posters connected to this work at ten national conferences. As part of one of the course enhancements, pre-service teachers in the life sciences designed and ran an Exploration Station at the Maine Science Festival in 2017, entitled &ldquo;We all have the same
