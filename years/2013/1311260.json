 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromosomal inversions, or structurally reversed portions of a chromosome, are a common and enigmatic form of genome structure evolution. Because inversions can suppress recombination between many genes, they are often characterized as 'supergenes' and have the potential to influence evolution in distinct ways from mutations in single genes. This project aims to dissect the evolution of one recently formed inversion in Drosophila melanogaster by identifying the genes that the inversion has captured. To accomplish this, the researchers will employ genetic mapping techniques using strains that do not bear the inversion, but that display a similar phenotype as inversion-bearing strains. After identifying the relevant genes, the researchers will use publically available data to analyze these genes to understand both their short and long term evolution. \r\n\r\n\tBeyond the direct scientific advances of this project, the broader impacts of the proposed research are numerous. The human genome is known to be highly polymorphic for chromosomal inversions and inversions have been directly implicated in human health concerns including reduced fertility and numerous diseases. It follows that understanding the natural selection that affects inversion evolution may yield valuable insight into many common human diseases. This project includes numerous opportunities for both undergraduate and high school students to participate, and the researchers are actively recruiting additional students to assist with this project and develop their own related projects. Finally, the software and theoretical tools developed for this project will enable other researchers to conduct similar research on chromosomal inversions in many other species.",
