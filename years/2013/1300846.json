 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop a new manufacturing process, Laser-driven Micro-Transfer Printing (LMTP), that enables the facile transfer of conventionally fabricated micro- and nanostructures from their handle or growth substrate to a functional substrate. It exploits the difference in the response of a printable (microstructure) ink and the stamp carrying it to a laser pulse to create a thermal mismatch strain at the stamp-ink interface. This energy stored in this mismatch strain drives the release of the ink from the stamp and its transfer to a receiving substrate. Using experimental observations and computational modeling, this research will seek to understand and characterize the thermo-mechanical phenomena involved in the process. This knowledge will be used to optimize the process elements (e.g., transfer stamp geometry and material) and parameters to allow for low-temperature, robust process behavior. Project deliverables include published models, knowledge and characterization of the LMTP process, a computerized manufacturing tool with an instrumented print head for the LMTP process, demonstrations of three-dimensional integrated circuit (3-D IC) packaging and printed multi-layer micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the project will provide a facile and efficient manufacturing pathway for realizing material-scale heterogeneous functional integration ? the controlled inserting of microscopic functional devices at the precise locations of the desired function. This type of capability is critical to emerging technologies such as flexible electronics, 3-D IC packaging and integrated micro-electromechanical systems. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom modules developed within this project as well as through involvement in the research. Efforts to motivate high school students to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers will benefit from the contributions that this project will make to high-school summer camps.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiology is soft, elastic and curved; silicon wafers are not.  An electronics technology that overcomes this fundamental mismatch in mechanics and form will enable applications that are impossible to achieve with hard, planar integrated circuits that exist today.  Examples range from surgical and diagnostic implements that naturally integrate with the human body to provide advanced therapeutic capabilities, to cameras that use biologically inspired designs to achieve superior performance.  Sensory skins for robotics, structural health monitors, wearable communication devices and other systems that require lightweight, rugged construction in thin, conformal formats will also be possible.  Establishing the foundations for this future in electronics represents an emerging direction for research, much different than the one dictated by the ongoing push toward smaller and faster devices that are still confined to the planar surfaces of silicon wafers.\n\nThis development will require an important technology, namely transfer printing, that uses a stamp to transfer electronics from their hard growth substrate to a soft and stretchable elastomeric substrate.  The main challenge here is control the adhesion of the stamp such that the electronics can be picked up from the growth substrate, and released easily onto the elastomeric substrate.  An analogy is to use a scotch tape (to mimic the stamp) transporting hairs (to mimic the electronics) from a bed (to mimic the growth substrate) to a floor (to mimic the elastomeric substrate).  A sticky scotch tape can easily pick up the hairs, but how can it let go the hairs easily onto the floor?\n\nThe laser-driven micro-transfer printing technique developed in this project provides robust answer/solution to this challenge.  By controlling the laser power and time, the adhesion between the stamp and electronics can be changed by three orders of magnitude, and therefore to achieve strong adhesion when picking up the electronics, and weak adhesion when releasing them, and therefore enables the development of stretchable and flexile electronics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yonggang Huang"
