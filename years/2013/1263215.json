 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the Division of Medical Sciences at Harvard University that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The scientific focus is in the area of cellular and molecular biology.  The main fields in which students conduct research include cell and developmental biology, microbiology, neurobiology, biochemistry, genetics, and virology.  Objectives of this REU are to: (a) increase knowledge of basic biological research; (b) develop students' interest in pursuing research careers; (c) enhance related skills necessary for success; and (d) provide post-program advising and networking. In addition to their research projects, program objectives are attained as students participate in weekly student-faculty research discussions at which they teach each other about their projects, and in a weekly career development series, which covers topics including choosing graduate programs, completing applications, networking, and interviewing.  Special skills sessions on critical reading of the literature and strategies for preparing for GRE exams are also included.  Ethics and responsible conduct of research topics cover experimental documentation, research fraud and misconduct, image manipulation, and ethical issues related to lab life.  Students participate in a peer advising/mentoring program with current graduate students and are provided additional opportunities to meet other research faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings.  Participants are recruited from a nation-wide pool, with emphasis on recruiting students interested in research careers and on recruiting members of under-represented minority groups and those who have few research opportunities on their home campuses.  Selection is based on statements of interest, recent academic achievement and preparation in science courses, recommendations, and previous research experience. Several mechanisms of formative and summative evaluation are employed and will include an assessment tool common to REU programs.  Program alumni receive twice-yearly newsletters, contact information about each other, and open access to continued advising and counseling by the REU program director, their individual research advisors, and their peer mentors. Follow-up activities facilitate effective tracking.  Information about the program can be found at: www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/diversity/Summer.html.   Contacts: Sheila M. Thomas, Ph.D., (PI); KeyAnna Schmiedl (Program Coordinator); 617-432-4980.",
