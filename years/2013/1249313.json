 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop new measures of land surface resilience through a novel study of layers of volcanic ash (tephra).  Changes in vegetation patterns are known to indicate changing land surface resilience and indicate proximity to threshold change. The morphology of cm-scale thicknesses of tephra is shaped by the pre-existing vegetation cover, in particular its depth, density, extent or patchiness. Thus, when tephra deposition is of a similar depth to the height of the pre-existing vegetation, tephra layer morphology can be used to assess relative land surface resilience at the time of tephra deposition. The researchers aim to develop new measures of resilience firstly through study of tephra layers created by recent Icelandic eruptions- the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and the 2011 eruption of Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn. Secondly, they will apply the new understandings gained from the study of very recent ash falls to the natural archive presented by the numerous past tephra layers preserved within the soil. Measures of land surface resilience and indications of proximity to threshold-crossing could make important contributions to understanding the interplay of changes driven by people and by the environment, and to the evolving field of sustainability science. In southern Iceland up to 21 tephra layers have been deposited since the Norse settlement, and these layers are clearly separated by intervening layers of aeolian sediment. We know that landscapes in these areas have been subject to directional drivers of change (such as falling temperatures and increasing grazing pressures) that have pushed land surfaces close to, and at times across, tipping points between one persistent state and another.  Knowledge of  ?near misses? in the past derived from novel uses of tephra layers could help us to understand the circumstances under which communities backed away from the brink of change, and the tradeoffs between adaptation and resilience, short term and long term robustness, and the effects of cross-scale conjunctures.  This project will involve an international, multidisciplinary team, combine theoretical and methodological innovation with fieldwork and laboratory analysis, and provide research opportunities for early career scholars.",
