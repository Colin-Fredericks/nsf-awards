 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaborative project is to explore the relationship between gas metallicity and star formation rate.  It will use the VISTA Magellanic Clouds (VMC) near IR survey photometry to extend a catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) to solar masses. The program will measure the amount of molecular gas present as a test of recent star formation theories and will ascertain the effects on the structure and formation of dense pre-stellar cores.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc in the use of ALMA, and release of GPIPS survey results and software to the astronomical community. The Baltimore-based postdoc and graduate students of Dr. Meixner will participate in Project ASTRO, which reaches out to the Baltimore City School system, while Co-I Dr. Indebetouw and his students will create new multi-wavelength components for K-12 teacher workshops.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMassive stars are beacons at high redshifts (large distances) that trace the star formation history of the Universe.  However, we do not understand how these stars form with masses  8 to 300 times the mass of our own Sun.   Moreover, most of our knowledge of star formation from the interstellar medium, which is the gas and dust between the stars,  is local to our Sun which is a very different environment than the epoch of peak star formation in the Universe.   In particular, the peak star formation rate occured in interstellar medium that has lower dust and metal  content than our own galaxy, the Milky Way.   \n\nWe have been studying massive star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud (see Figure 1), which is our neighboring galaxy with low dust and metal content that is similar to the epoch of peak star formation in the Universe.   We derive the properties of the forming massive stars from space observatory infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory and ground based near-infrared survey data from 2MASS.  We observed three massive star formation regions with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which is a phenomenal radio observatory operated by the USA?s National Radio Astronomy Observatory in collaboration with similar European and Japanese organizations.   ALMA?s spectacular angular resolution revealed the location, size and properties of the molecular gas  participating in massive star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud for the first time (see Figure 2).   \n\nIn her PhD Thesis work,  Dr. Omnarayani Nayak compared the molecular  cloud properties with the forming massive star masses to discover several new facts about massive star formation. Massive star formation needs much higher gas surface densities than low mass star formation. The mass surface density threshold for massive star formation is  at least 50 solar masses per light year squared, or 5 times higher than that for low mass star formation.  Very massive stars (at least 23 times that mass of our Sun) appear in the highest density gas and are often associated with the collision of filaments of molecular gas.  \n\nThe most massive forming star in the Large Magellanic Cloud turned out to be a candidate forming super star cluster,  which has several to many massive stars forming in close proximity to each other.   This discovery was very exciting because it gives astronomers insight into the most extreme mode of star formation.  Dr. Nayak revealed that this new object is located at the nexus of several colliding filaments and features an accreting torus of molecular gas and significant outflows of molecular gas.  This exciting new object will become the focus of intensive followup with future space observatories, like the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be launched in 2021.\n\nDr. Nayak also investigated the massive star formation near the super star cluster in the famous Tarantula Nebula (a.k.a. 30 Doradus).  She found that the feedback from the already formed massive stars in the super star cluster is so intense that it affects the properties of the molecular gas clouds near them.  In particular, the turbulence of the molecular gas is significantly higher than more quiescent regions of star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This result confirms  theories that star formation in a galaxy is regulated by massive star feedback. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Margaret Meixner"
