 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to drill, analyze, and interpret a new ice core from the Renland Ice Cap on the north east coast of Greenland. The project is a collaborative venture between scientists from the U.S., Denmark's Center for Ice and Climate at the Univ. of Copenhagen and Germany's Alfred Wegner Institute. U.S. efforts described here will focus on gas concentrations and gas isotopes (Sowers, Penn State) and ice isotopes (White, U. Colorado). Danish partners will also focus on stable isotopes of ice and gas composition, as well as high-resolution chemistry. German partners will focus on physical properties of the ice, line scanning and dielectric properties to investigate the factors driving snow densification and ice core age model development. Ice cores will be retrieved and processed within this international framework. Given the distinct possibility that the Renland ice cap will contain ice even older than the Eemian, an extremely high resolution Radio Echo Sounding (RES) mission will be flown by the CReSIS group at the Univ. of Kansas over the Renland Ice Cap in the summer of 2014, in order to help guide site selection for the 2015 drill project.  Renland is an important location for an ice core as it is cold (infrequent melt layers), constrained by topography so that it cannot significantly change in elevation, contains ice from the last glacial period (and possibly the Eemian period), and has not been overrun by the main Greenland ice sheet. The lack of elevation change means that Renland's isotopic temperature and total air content records can be used as climate standards against which to compare other Greenland ice cores. The Renland ice cap is about 400 meters thick so it does not contain brittle ice. These properties will allow significant scientific progress to be made in mapping out and constraining Greenland climatic conditions in general, but especially for the Holocene. The occurrence of brittle ice in other Greenland ice cores has limited our ability to reconstruct high-resolution climate records due to poor core quality.  The Renland ice core will provide the means of reconstructing greenhouse gas records, volcanic activity, biomass burning events, as well as key feedback mechanisms such as sea ice extent throughout the Holocene. Primary objectives of this project are: 1) link the recent, rapid warming seen in Greenland over the past decade to the baseline record of the past few centuries, as well as the broader Holocene record; 2) provide high-quality gas records throughout the Holocene from a Greenland core to test current theories about the how early human activity may have impacted the greenhouse gas composition; 3) provide an ultra-high resolution isotopic temperature record that is tightly coupled to sea ice near eastern Greenland, as well as a history of climate in this region hopefully extending back into the last interglacial period. This project will provide important data to inform the public, and policy makers, about the earth's climate and what causes changes in that climate. This project proposes to place both the records of sea ice off eastern Greenland, as well as the climate record, into the context of natural variability, and further understanding of recent rapid changes in Arctic temperatures and sea ice. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students.",

The original ice core demonstrated that the Renland ice cap was a promising location for climate interpretations that extend into the last interglacial period (Eemian). Using radar technology, a new drilling site on Renland was chosen to maximize ice depth and limit deformation and folding at the base. The Renland isotope record was measured by continuous flow analysis (CFA) in conjunction with gas, chemistry, black carbon, and several other records. The measurements took place at the Center for Ice and Climate (CIC) at the University of Copenhagen in Fall 2015. Two instruments were used in parallel: a Picarro L<em>-</em>2130<em>i</em> from the University of Colorado Boulder measuring d<sup>18</sup>O, dD, and deuterium excess (d-excess), and a L<em>-</em>2140<em>i </em>from CIC making the same measurements with the addition of d<sup>17</sup>O (Figure 1). Discrete measurements were also analyzed at CIC to validate the CFA system. In March 2017, additional isotopic measurements were completed with a Picarro L-2140<em>i</em>. With this additional data, we have obtained a nearly complete isotope record for the entire length of the Renland core, except for a 10-meter section that is still being processed. A completed data set is expected to be available by January 2018; preliminary data is used here to discuss findings thus far.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of ongoing research is to determine possible climate mechanisms that may have differing effects on d<sup>18</sup>O, dD, and d-excess. Because the Renland ice core is located close to the East coast of Greenland, there is likely a strong signal from oceanic conditions such as sea ice. As d-excess is partly influenced by the sea surface temperature at the precipitation source, it is expected that it will reflect changes in sea ice extent: when sea ice extends farther south, the precipitation will originate from a warmer source, thus causing d-excess to increase. Changes in d-excess that are not reflected in d<sup>18</sup>O and dD indicate a change in source conditions that is not reflected in the temperature of snow deposition, and are possibly due to a combination of two mechanisms: 1) cycles in atmospheric or oceanic circulation patterns causing the precipitation source to move; and 2) changes in sea ice extent or drift ice, such as ice flushing through the Fram Strait or ice sheet break-up. Mechanism 1 is supported by the presence of several circulation cycles in the Arctic, including millennial scale cycles, North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Arctic Oscillation. Mechanism 2 is supported by previous research documenting ice-rafted debris on the East Greenland Shelf, particularly at 5.5 ka when the abrupt end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum is reflected by IRD and appears to correlate well with observations of d-excess at Renland. Our near-term goal is to better understand the physical mechanisms that influence the isotopic signals so that we can extract valuable information about sea ice conditions or atmospheric circulation patterns.</p>\n<p>In order to determine whether d-excess accurately reflects sea ice extent under modern atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, correlations have been determined between the d-excess record and satellite records of sea ice extent (Figure 3). Preliminary results indicate that d-excess has a high correlation to sea ice in areas along the edge of the Arctic Ocean, as shown in Figure 2. In particular, there is an area of high correlation along the East coast of Greenland, which may be due to ice flushing through the Fram Strait along the East Greenland Current. Future work will involve extensive comparisons with other proxies for sea ice both in the Renland ice core and from other sources, such as ice rafted debris. Bromine and sodium were both measured continuously in the Renland core, and also act as proxies for sea ice. Comparisons between d-excess, bromine, and sodium could help to constrain whether changes in the d-excess signal reflect circulation patterns or changes in sea ice.</p>\n<p>Finally, Abigail Thayer will continue to work on analyzing the water isotope records as part of her PhD research, supported by the NSF GRFP. Continuing work will focus on developing an understanding of the d-excess record and how it represents records of sea ice and atmospheric climate signals. Comparisons to other proxies both within the Renland ice core and from other areas of Greenland and the Arctic Ocean will provide a better picture of how we can use d-excess in combination with d<sup>18</sup>O and dD to reconstruct climate conditions. This information could then be applied to an isotope-driven climate model in order to better understand climate dynamics in the Arctic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;W&nbsp;White</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304109/1304109_10256825_1514486488866_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304109/1304109_10256825_1514486488866_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304109/1304109_10256825_1514486488866_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Monthly averages of d-excess and the satellite sea ice record were calculated and compared for the period from 1997-2013.
