 "awd_abstract_narration": "Severe hail, particularly in urban areas, can cause significant injury and millions of dollars in property damage.  These impacts, however, could be significantly mitigated with more accurate and precise hail predictions based on 0-2 hour numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts.  To provide such NWP forecasts requires advances in data assimilation (DA), the development of innovative ensemble forecast methods, and the application of novel data mining techniques to represent and predict hail within state-of-the-art NWP models.  The Severe Hail Analysis, Representation, and Prediction project (SHARP) will focus on answering two scientific hypotheses: (1) assimilation of data from new and multiple data sources (including single- and dual-polarization Doppler radars, wind profilers, soundings, and surface observations) will improve hail representation within a NWP model, and (2) application of advanced data-mining techniques to NWP ensemble output will improve predictions of hail size and coverage.  The specific goals of SHARP will be to: (1) produce and verify 0-2 hour ensemble forecasts of severe hail for a variety of events; (2) assess the ability of these forecasts to correctly represent hail as observed by dual-polarization Doppler radars and other instruments; and (3) accurately predict the geographic extent and size of hail reaching the surface, verifying the forecasts against high-quality observational data sets such as those produced by the NOAA Severe Hazards Analysis and Verification Experiment (SHAVE). Forecast ensemble output will be compared against radar-based extrapolation methods.  The intellectual merit of this effort lies in progress toward application of advanced data assimilation (using multiple-moment microphysics and dual-polarization radar data) and data mining for short-term hail prediction.  Though data mining has been applied to precipitation forecasts at the continental scale, far more novel is its use alongside advanced Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) DA for convective-scale NWP.  This effort builds upon previous work by the PIs in the fields of DA, storm-scale ensemble prediction, and data mining. This project is expected to advance the science of severe weather prediction, defining a paradigm linking data assimilation and data mining that could be applied to predict other convective-scale hazards such as downbursts and tornadoes.  With sufficient computing resources, the techniques and algorithms developed in this project could be applied to support real-time severe weather warning operations, as envisioned in the NWS \"Warn-on-Forecast\" paradigm. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of will include enhanced cross-disciplinary connections disciplinary and potential economic benefits to sectors including aviation that are especially vulnerable to hail.  Results will aid in improving lead-time and user confidence in hail warnings, giving vulnerable industries increased opportunity to mitigate damage and individuals additional time to seek shelter. Collaboration with the National Severe Storms Laboratory will enable comparison and testing of results against operational, radar-based extrapolation methods and enable transfer of knowledge and tools to NWS forecasters responsible for severe weather warnings.  The PIs will provide interdisciplinary training to graduate students, as well as undergraduate students through the OU/CAPS Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, with which the PIs have a strong history of involvement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we advanced the science of hail prediction by improving our understanding of how hail is handled by computer weather prediction models.  To do this, we ran very high resolution weather forecast models which used radar and surface weather observations (such as measurements of temperature, dew point, and winds) to maximize the accuracy of the model's initial condition (the \"snapshot\" of the atmosphere from which the model starts).  For each prediction, an ensemble (collection) of 40 forecasts were run, each using slightly different initial conditions--this collection of forecasts allowed us to better predict the range of possible outcomes and how probable they were.  We found that, with proper use of weather data and a properly configured ensemble of computer model forecasts, it was possible to produce skillful (useful) predictions of severe hail up to three hours in advance.  To prove that our methods were robust, we tested them by producing forecasts for several different hailstorms and comparing the forecast results to the actual storms. \n\nThe forecast system we developed was consistently able to produce useful forecasts of severe hail.  We also identified what types of errors the computer models make in predicting hail, and in how the models treat hail within storms, both of which will allow those errors to better be corrected in the future, leading to more accurate and reliable forecasts of severe hail.  In addition, we advanced the science of hail forecast verification?that is, the methods we use to determine how accurate and useful a hail forecast was.  Verification of hail forecasts is very challenging, because hail reports from the general public do not give a full picture of where hail fell and how large it was, in part because hail is often not reported by the public when it falls in sparsely-populated, remote, or rural areas.  We found that radar observations could be used together with surface hail reports to better verify hail forecasts.  Though radars do not directly observe hail, data from newer dual-polarization radars (which use two differently-polarized radar beams and are capable of distinguishing the size and shape of precipitation particles such as raindrops or hailstones) can be used to identify regions where hail is likely occurring.  Because radar gives a fully three-dimensional measurement of the atmosphere, even over remote rural areas, it is a very good dataset for verifying forecasts.  We developed methods for estimating the maximum hail size from computer weather model data for comparing against the maximum size estimated by radar, as well as new methods for directly comparing hail variables in the model against dual-polarization radar observations.\n\nWe also developed artificial intelligence (machine learning) methods that were capable of successfully predicting areas where severe hail was likely to occur one to two days in advance.  These types of predictions are similar to the Day 1 and Day 2 hail outlooks issued by the Storm Prediction Center.  The forecast methods we developed used machine learning methods to predict whether a given storm in a computer model forecast would contain hail, and, if it was predicted to contain hail, how large that hail was expected to be.  By training these machine learning models on a set of forecasts known as the CAPS Storm Scale Ensemble Forecast?an experimental set of forecasts covering the lower 48 United States which are run for several weeks each spring?we were able to produce predictions of the likelihood of severe hail which were superior to other existing forecast methods.  The machine learning hail forecast methods developed during this project have since been the focus of a NOAA project seeking to incorporate them into operational severe weather forecasting, which will allow Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service forecasters to use them to improve the accuracy and lead-time of severe weather watches and warnings issued to the public.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan A Snook"
