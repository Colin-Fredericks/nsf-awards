The integration of\r\nrobots into the Cloud holds the promise of giving unprecedented computation and memory\r\nresources to the robots. In parallel, robots can augment Cloud applications by giving them the\r\npower to collect data on demand.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together robotics, cloud computing and big-data researches to explore\r\nthe opportunities and challenges in Cloud Robotics.",
