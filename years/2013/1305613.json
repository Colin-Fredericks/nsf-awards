 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to study topology of 3-manifolds, especially Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds.  The first part of the project is to investigate the relation between the Heegaard genus of a 3-manifold and the rank of its fundamental group.  This research is built on the PI's recent success in constructing a hyperbolic counterexample to the Rank versus Genus Conjecture. The second goal of the proposed research is to answer a long-standing question in 3-manifold topology concerning Heegaard genus and a degree-one map.  This question asks whether it is possible to have a degree-one map from a 3-manifold to another 3-manifold with larger Heegaard genus.  This question is related to the Poincare Conjecture as well as a few other important questions in 3-manifold topology. The third part of the project is to solve a conjecture of Morimoto and Moriah on tunnel number of knots in the 3-sphere. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nThree-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are living in.  A donut and the spatial universe are both examples of 3-manifolds.  These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena.  A geometric way of studying 3-manifolds is to cut a complicated 3-manifold into a pair of simpler 3-dimensional pieces called handebodies along a 2-dimensional surface.  This decomposition is called a Heegaard splitting.   The PI plans to study 3-manifolds using Heegaard splittings.  The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.",

Topology is a branch of mathematics studying the qualitative shape and intrinsic properties of geometric objects. Topological ideas are present in almost all areas of today's mathematics. Manifolds are geometric objects that locally modeled on the Euclidean spaces.  For instance, a 2-dimensional manifold is just a surface.  The main focus of this project is 3-dimensional manifolds, often referred to as 3-manifolds.  Three-manifold research has attracted significant attention in that 3-manifolds have beautiful geometric and combinatorial structures and many important questions remain unsolved.  A better understanding of these structures is of central interest in geometry and topology and may have a profound impact on physical and other natural sciences.\n\nThree-dimensional manifolds have many beautiful geometric and topological structures.  The main structure that the PI has been studying is called Heegaard splitting.  A Heegaard splitting is a simple and very useful decomposition of a 3-manifold along a 2-dimensional surface. Every 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting. In this project, the PI has been trying to solve several important long-standing questions in low-dimensional topology.  The first question involves an important relation between 3-manifolds called degree-one map.  A long-standing conjecture in 3-manifold topology asserts that the minimal genus of Heegaard splittings of a 3-manifold does not decrease under a degree-one map.  In this project, the PI has proved a special case of this conjecture.  Another major conjecture in 3-manifold topology is called Berge Conjecture, which classifies all knots in the 3-dimensional sphere that can produce certain simple 3-manifolds called lens spaces via a surgery operation.  The PI and his collaborators have made significant progress toward solving one-half of this conjecture.  Moreover, the PI has also used techniques developed in this project to study various questions in knot theory and constructed a counter-example to a conjecture of Morimoto and Moriah. \n\nThe PI has supervised a Ph.D. student on his thesis research using topics related to the NSF project.
