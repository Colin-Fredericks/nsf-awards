 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Alena Mikhaylova of the University of Texas at Arlington to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Kyungpook National University in Daegu, Republic of Korea.  The project title is \"Effect of Steel Fiber Distribution and Orientation on Mechanical Characteristics of Zero-Slump Concrete.\" The host scientist is Yeol Choi, Ph.D., P.E.\r\n\r\nThe application of steel fiber as alternative reinforcement in concrete has gained popularity in recent years due to added ductility and crack control, which leads to more sustainable structures. The proposed research program is aiming to establish the relationship between uniformity of fiber distribution within concrete matrix and material strength in concrete specimens. Quantitative and statistical analyses are being conducted for the representative sample of specimens by counting the number of fibers in a specimen per unit area. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the results of the study conducted at the host institution will be presented at international conferences and related concrete meetings and organizations. The findings will also be submitted as journal manuscripts to the top tier peer reviewed journals such as ACI Structural, ASCE structural and Transportation Research Record.  The results of this study and experience abroad will be presented to the meetings of Society of Women Engineers (SWE) in order to excite other female undergraduate and graduate students to join NSF programs such the EAPSI.",
