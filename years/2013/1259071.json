 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships to approximately 50-65 full-time, academically talented and financially disadvantaged STEM students in Biological Sciences, Computer Sciences, Engineering, Mathematical Sciences or Physical Sciences at Los Medanos College. Project objectives include: (1) increasing the number of underrepresented minority students in STEM majors who meet their degree and transfer requirements; (2) graduating or transferring at least 75% of STEM scholars within three years; (3) providing robust programmatic infrastructure to ensure increasing success rates within the STEM scholars cohort;  and (4) expanding and enriching learning and career placement opportunities by requiring  STEM Scholars to participate in professional development activities  such as career exploration, job shadowing, mentorships, internships, and research activities. The project is collaborating with the existing MESA program to provide the necessary student support services for the scholars.\r\n\r\nThe project increases the numbers of traditionally underserved, low-income STEM students who obtain STEM degrees and/or transfer to four-year universities as STEM majors. Results from a number of project components could be informative for the larger academic community in its efforts to ensure student success. Project findings are also advancing the understanding and knowledge of innovative teaching and learning practices for working with motivated, academically talented, low-income STEM students. Finally, the project is contributing to local economic development by providing a skilled STEM workforce.",
