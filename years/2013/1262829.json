The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, with an emphasis placed on recruiting women or students from minorities that are underrepresented in the scientific community, as well as recruiting students from institutions lacking access to first-rate research staff and facilities. The primary goals of the REU program at KPNO are to encourage undergraduates to pursue careers in science, to foster high levels of scientific literacy among the future science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and to stimulate a lifelong interest in the achievements and welfare of U.S. astronomy. \r\n\r\nA wide variety of REU projects will be offered to students during this summer program. These include: using luminous galaxies to trace the growth of the universe; understanding the evolution of stars; and pioneering research into light pollution. As part of their research activities, REU students will gain first-hand experience with KPNO's state-of-the art telescopes and instrumentation, and develop expertise in the tools of data analysis specific to astronomical research. In addition, they will participate in a series of lectures and workshops designed particularly to expose them to a range of research topics, techniques, and astronomical facilities. Finally, the REU Site offers the opportunity for students to present their research at the American Astronomical Society meeting, which is a major international conference.",
