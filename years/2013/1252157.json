The PIs will address this broad question by developing integrative approaches to bring new data to the paleofaunal databases from the hominin-bearing Omo sequence (paleofauna collected by the The International Omo Research Expedition, IORE, 1966-1976). Existing taxonomic abundance data from these large and systematically collected paleofaunal databases will be integrated with new, independent paleoecological data from stable isotopes and ecomorphological features of the paleofaunal community. The stable isotopic composition of tooth enamel from hominins and other primates from this sequence will also be analyzed for the first time.\r\n\r\nBroader Significance and Importance:\r\nThe results of this research will not only address questions of paleodiets and paleoecology of East African faunas, but may significantly transform our understanding of the the evolution of the mammalian community in the Omo-Turkana Basin of Ethiopia and Kenya from >4 to 1.2 million years ago, which is one of the most significant basins for early human evolutionary studies. This study will also provide direct and fresh data on the diets consumed by at least four hominin species encountered in the Omo sequence, and will better our understanding of when and where hominins first began to significantly consume foods derived from savanna resources. The research will continue international collaborations between US academic institutions and the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa, which provides a venue for public outreach and education within Ethiopia and beyond. The data from this project will be incorporated into a database system, and made readily available via several outlets. This proposal will provide graduate training for two graduate students integrating several research communities: geology, geochemistry, paleontology, and paleoanthropology. The research results will be used in a variety of outlets for public outreach.",

In this project we investigated dietary evolution and shifts in eastern Africa during a time interval that saw the emergence of our genus <em>Homo</em>. We employed stable isotope analysis to investigate when human ancestors transitioned from a more tree based diet known as C3, &nbsp;involving a considerable amount of fruits and leaves which is also known to characterize the earliest hominins and our living ape cousins, chimpanzees and gorillas to a more C4 food items characterized by grasses and sedge. Extensive dental enamel powder samples from hominins and other herbivores from the Shungura sequence in Ethiopia were analyzed using mass spectrometer. The results show that a major dietary shift occurred around 2.4 million years ago in both <em>Paranthropus</em> (also known as robust australopiths) and <em>Homo</em> indicating that hominins transitioned to a C4 dominated diet in the region around this time. This finding is critical as paleoanthropologists strive to explore the link between morphology, diet, environmental and climatic changes during human evolution. During the course of this project, our team has trained several students, postdocs and curators locally and internationally. Particularly, this project has allowed a UMR female scientist to pursue and successfully defend her PhD work.
