 "awd_abstract_narration": "To improve our understanding of historical and modern extreme temperatures, researchers at Harvard University will analyze instrumental and temperature-sensitive proxies of past climate using new statistical approaches.  Specifically, the researchers will explore the relationships between instrumental and proxy indicators of extremes, reconstruct temperature extremes in space and time, and provide a better understanding of how changes in mean climate relate to the occurrences of extreme events.  The analysis strategy is to extend an existing Bayesian methodology for inferring past climate to more directly target extremes. Definition of \"extremes\" will meet the standards set forth by the National Research Council in 2006 for accurate quantification of the probability that quantities such as maxima, minima, or rates-of-change are truly exceptional.\r\n\r\nExtremes are by definition rare, making the need for records longer than are afforded by instruments alone perhaps even more acute than for evaluation of mean climate.  Successful completion of this project will provide insight into the co-variability between background climate and extremes over a time period long enough to establish baseline conditions. The work will also provide important context in which to interpret and assess modern changes.  Given that disparate mechanisms are responsible for warming and cooling over the last 600 hundred years, this research will also indicate the extent to which past relationships between mean climate and extremes can be used as analogues for future changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the societal relevance of better understanding extreme events, other broader impacts include training of a graduate student and support of an early career researcher with no prior NSF support. All software tools developed during this research will be made freely and publicly available to the paleoclimate community, as will any compilations of publicly available data sets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "To improve our understanding of historical and modern extreme temperatures, we undertook exploration of paleoclimate records sensitive to temperature, historical instrumental records of temperature, and model simulations using newly developed statistical approaches.  Our research yielded improved insight into the controls on proxy variability, a better understanding of how mean temperature and the variability about the mean have varied through time, and a more comprehensive assessment of how well model simulations capture these changes.  This document provides some illustrations of our chief results.  Readers interested in a complete account of the research supported by this grant are referred to the 21 papers published in the peer reviewed literature resulting from this award.  \n\n \n\nExtremes are by definition rare, making the need for long and accurate records arguably more acute than for evaluation of mean climate.  Much of our work focused on improving ability to extract information about extremes from paleoclimate and instrumental records.  With respect to paleoclimate records, we were concerned whether extreme events are expressed in a manner that can be linearly extrapolated from smaller perturbations.  Thus, we explored how tree rings respond to large volcanic eruptions in Stine and Huybers (2014) and found outsized tree-ring-density responses in the Arctic in certain regions (Fig. 1).\n\nAnalysis of instrumental records of temperature indicate that these regions do not show a greater cooling response (Tingley et al., 2014).  Rather, the distinguishing factor is that regions showing a larger response are cloudier.  Although increased clouds produce more diffuse radiation, in light-limited regions of the Arctic the net photosynthetically active radiation appears to decrease with increased clouds.  We speculate that increased aerosol content following a volcanic eruption further decreases light availability and restricts growth, implying that tree ring density records in the Arctic represent both changes in light and temperature availability.  Large decreases in tree ring density in much of the Arctic thus appears to follow from the combined effects of cooling and dimming.  Interpreting the tree ring density response as temperature alone would lead to overestimating how extreme the cooling is after volcanic eruptions.\n\nWith respect to the historical instrumental record, we noticed the curious situation that about half of all daily instrumental records were originally recorded in Fahrenheit and then converted Celsius.  This would pose no problem except that the Fahrenheit measurements were rounded to differing accuracies (typically not recorded) and the Celsius conversion was then applied and rounded again.  Such double rounding often leads to the last digit of the temperature record not actually being centered on the most likely value.  We developed a Hidden-Markov model to infer the original units of temperature data using the distribution of trailing digits (Rhines et al., 2015) and to correct millions of temperature observations.\n\nAs a final example of improving ability to interpret temperature records, Proistosescu et al. (2016) explored the contributions that various frequency components make in determining the non-normality of temperature variability. Previous publications have sought to identify physical mechanisms associated with non-normal features through identifying their timescale, and we show that the structure of non-normality depends upon both physical characteristics of temperature variability and statistical relationships wherein certain phase-frequency pairing is needed to generate non-normality (Fig. 2).   These results help us better determine the origins of non-normality in temperature and, thus, better characterize and identify extreme events and their changes.  \n\nAnother track of work was characterizing spatial and temporal components of variability.  Tingley and Huybers (2015) examined the relationship between the mean and spatial variability of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies over the last 1200 years using instrumental and tree-ring proxy records.  Using a Mann-Whitney U Statistic on 14 well-studied, annually-resolved proxy records we found increased spatial variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) relative to that of the Little Ice Age (LIA).  Analysis of the instrumental record shows a similar pattern, where late- and middle-twentieth century warm intervals are associated with increased spatial variability (Fig. 3).\n\nWe also comprehensively analyzed how the distribution of temperatures across the mid-latitudes have changed as a function of season (McKinnon et al. 2016; Rhines et al. 2017).  The approach we have foremost relied upon is quantile regression of daily-resolved instrumental records.  In order to more completely understand the results and to assign uncertainty estimates, we have developed understanding of the statistical properties of this estimator in terms of covariance across percentiles (McKinnon et al. JGR 2016) and across space (Rhines et al. 2017).    Our chief finding is that, counter to assertions that the variance of mid-latitude temperature is increasing that have been published elsewhere, we find that variance is generally stable and only changes in the mean are readily detected.   The exception is that variance of winter temperatures in Northern mid-latitudes are decreasing (Rhines et al. 2017), apparently on account of Arctic warming reducing the prevalence of cold-air outbreaks.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Huybers"
