Similarly, the ability to store energy and\r\nuse it when demanded will provide a more seamless operation of electric vehicles whether during\r\nacceleration/deceleration or in cruise mode. Among different energy storage technologies, supercapacitors\r\nor electrochemical capacitors are emerging as an attractive option for delivering much higher power (rate\r\nof energy transfer) than alternative options like the lithium ion battery.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nSupercapacitors that store charge through electrochemical double layers possess higher power density but\r\nlack sufficient energy density. By incorporating electroactive polymers, which undergo relatively fast\r\nredox reactions, further pseudocapacitance can be added to enhance energy density. However, as the\r\nsupercapacitor electrodes are typically highly porous nanostructures, there remains significant synthesis\r\nand processing challenges in adding the electroactive polymers onto the surfaces of pores inside these\r\nnanostructures without sacrificing surface area or pore access. The PI plans an oxidative\r\nchemical vapor deposition (oCVD) approach that will address many of the challenges by enabling the\r\nconformal, uniform growth of thin films of electroactive polymers inside porous nanostructured materials.\r\nThe central hypothesis is that the liquid-free, vapor-to-solid polymerization reactions will lead to surface\r\nconfined polymer growth and ultrathin films that do not significantly alter the underlying pore structure\r\nwhile adding appreciable pseudocapacitance. This work will involve (1) synthesis of\r\nelectroactive polymer thin films in porous nanostructures, (2) understanding the effect of processing on\r\npolymer structure and properties, and (3) assembly and electrochemical analysis of pseudocapacitors that\r\nmake use of oCVD to incorporate the electroactive polymers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nThis work is expected to deliver enhanced supercapacitors with significantly\r\nhigher specific capacitance, energy density, power density and cycle stability, making them viable for use\r\nin electric and hybrid vehicles as well as in the development of greener energy systems that include solar\r\ncells and fuel cells. Fundamentally, the work is expected to provide an effective synthesis and\r\nprocessing methodology for conformally coating porous nanostructures that will have broader utility in\r\nother nanoscale devices, including electronics, sensors, solar cells, fuel cells, transistors and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Integrated with the research is an education program, which aims to train graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents as well as to engage high school students in polymers for energy. Minority and underrepresented\r\nstudents will be actively recruited to participate in the project. In addition, outreach will be\r\nmade to schools in Philadelphia and inner city Camden, NJ to promote STEM involvement and learning\r\nearly on.",
