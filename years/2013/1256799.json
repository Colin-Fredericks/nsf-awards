 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical component of successful reproduction in female mammals involves integration with the male's reproductive state.  How the female performs this integration is understood at the behavioral level, but is still poorly understood at the neurobiological level.  A neural model will be developed to precisely measure chemical signaling of dopamine in a particular brain region (the nucleus accumbens) where dopaminergic activity is temporally synchronized with behavioral interactions with the male for successful reproduction.  A technically sophisticated and innovative approach know as fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, combined with electrophysiological recording, will be used to measure dopamine release in the female's nucleus accumbens during reproduction and determine how nerve cells respond to dopamine-mediated signals.  The fast scan cyclic voltammetry has the capability of measuring dynamic changes in dopamine signaling by taking measurements every 100 milliseconds, thus temporally coupling dopamine signaling and behavioral responses. This project will not only identify how the nervous system solves a complex problem of reproductive integration of brain and behavioral activities, but will also open up new avenues for detailed analyses of the neural regulation of reproduction and other social behaviors.  The transfer of technology from Dr. Paul Garris's lab (Dr. Garris is a world leader in the development of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry) at Illinois State University to the University of Minnesota is a significant impact of the research goals. The project will also provide a platform for making this technology available to a range of investigators throughout the country.  The development of this technology and subsequent dissemination will include making the raw data available online as well as creating online simulations that can be used as instructional tools through OmniScience (www.omnisci.org).  The project will provide an important research base for the inclusion of undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented minority students, as a component of their science education and literacy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n A prevailing misconception of animal reproduction is that delivery of sperm to the female's reproductive tract during ovulation is sufficient for successful pregnancy.  Surprisingly, in addition to fertilization, female animals require a particular species-specific pattern of vaginal stimulation for the fertilized ovum to be implanted in the uterus.  Our prior work identified the nucleus accumbens as a critical neural site for the integration of sensory information with behaviors and hormonal reflexes that provide the basis for successful pregnancy.  In this grant period we examined chemical communication to the nucleus accumbens during mating and identified a small circuit involving the nucleus accumbens important for regulating the species-specific pattern needed for pregnancy.\n\nWe first took a technically novel approach to the question of chemical communication by implanting probes specific for measuring dopamine or glutamate into the nucleus accumbens.  With these probes we could record second-by-second changes in dopamine and glutamate in the female hamster's brain while receiving mating stimulation from the male hamster.  We discovered that both dopamine and glutamate were released in the nucleus accumbens, and importantly this release of chemicals was time locked to the female receiving vaginal stimulation from the mounting male.  This was the first demonstration that vaginal stimulation was associated with neural activity, providing neurobiological confirmation of a decades old hypothesis that had never been formally tested.\n\nOur next approach to this question was to examine brain regions activated during sexual behavior in females.  We confirmed our prior findings of increased cellular activity in the nucleus accumbens during sexual behavior in female hamsters.  In addition, we discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex was also activated during sex.  This lead to the question of the source of that activation.  The ventral tegmentum provides dopamine input to both the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens.  The prefrontal cortex provides glutamate input to the nucleus accumbens.  The question raised here was whether the activation of the prefrontal cortex were independent events or whether one region was driving the other?\n\nOur first step in answering this question was to anatomically trace inputs from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens and test whether these nucleus accumbens inputs were activated during sex.  The answer to this question was 'yes'.  Given that prefrontal cortex neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens were active during sex, could we identify the chamical activator?  There are two primary types of neurons in the prefrontal cortex; those using glutamate as a chemical signal and those using glutamate.  We stained the neurons in the prefrontal cortex for either GABA or glutamate and identified which group of neurons were activated during sex.  It turned out that only the glutamate neurons were activated.  The circuit that emerged from these studies as wel as information from previous studies suggested that the ventral tegmentum projected to the prefrontal cortex and that the activated prefrontal cortex in turn activated the nucleus accumbens.\n\nWe tested our hypothesis about this functional circuit using a genetic engineering approach to manipulate the prefrontal cortex.  We used non-replicating (i.e., non-infectious) viruses to introduce genes coding for an artificial receptor into the prefrontal cortex. Tthis artificial receptor is termed a DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) and we used a DREADD designed to block activation of the glutamate neurons in the prefrontal cortex.  What we found was that blocking prefrontal cortex glutamate neurons prevented the activation of the nucleus accumbens during sex.  In other words, these results supported our hypothesized circuit controlling the flow of information from vaginal stimulation during sex to the nucleus accumbens.\n\nBesides the research supported by this grant, we also used our funds to support a number of outreach activities.  We actively participated in training future generations of scientists by recruiting undergraduate students to the lab to help with the research.  Many of these were University of Minnesota students, however we recruited summer students from other universities as well.  These summer students were all from minority groups or came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  We are excited by the fact that for those students who have graduated from their undergraduate institutions they are in graduate school in neuroscience, medical school or in one case teaching high school biology.\n\nThe research grant also provided a foundation for our participation in two evening events held at the Minnesota Science Museum on the \"Science of Sex\".  We had a table at the event and had presentations on the pleasure principle of sex and on drugs used to treat sexual disorders in men and women.\n\nCollectively, the grant supported our research of course, but also provided training for budding scientists, and scientific outreach into the community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Meisel"
