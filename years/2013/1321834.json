 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics. The ACL's annual conference is the major international conference in this field. This project is to subsidize travel, conference and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the ACL Student Research Workshop, which will take place during the main ACL conference on August 4-9, 2013 in Sofia, Bulgaria. The Student Research Workshop accepts papers in two categories: thesis/research proposal and general research papers. The thesis/research proposal can have only one author who must be a student. The research papers can have multiple authors, with the first author being a student. The workshop is organized and run by students.\r\n\r\nThe Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the research community. It allows the students in the field to take an important step towards becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their dissertation committee, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and reviewing for the student workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The ACL Student Research Workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing community.",
