 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. A key step in regulating gene expression is the rate at which specific mRNA molecules are degraded. The protein synthesis machinery translates single mRNAs repeatedly to produce multiple proteins. In part, the amount of protein produced is dependent on the mRNA lifespan because this determines how much of each type of mRNA is available for translation and how many times each mRNA is translated. Each mRNA has a specific lifespan, and for many mRNAs, lifespan is modulated in response to environmental or intracellular changes. mRNA decay rates are determined by interactions between cis-elements within the mRNAs and the mRNA decay machinery. RNA binding proteins can mediate these interactions. However little is known about how these interactions lead to functional changes in the rate at which an mRNA is degraded. The objective of this project is to identify the mechanisms that permit wild type mRNAs with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) targting signals to evade the NMD pathway. NMD is a specialized pathway that is responsible for the recognition and rapid degradation of mRNAs with premature stop codons and some wild type mRNAs as well. However, not all wild type mRNAs with NMD targeting cis-elements are degraded by the NMD pathway. The mechanism responsible for protection of these mRNAs from NMD is unknown. The hypothesis that protection from NMD is mediated by RNA binding proteins which interfere with the NMD pathway and thus redirect these mRNAs for decay by the default pathways will be tested using both biochemical and genetic tools in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This research will provide valuable new insight into how the NMD pathway is regulated and serve as a paradigm for how mRNA decay regulators modulate the decay of specific mRNAs by influencing the mRNA decay machinery.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The research will increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating gene expression at the mRNA level. The new knowledge of the mechanisms regulating mRNA decay that will be generated by this project is expected to lead to a new set of tools for controlling gene expression. The project will also have an impact on human resource development through the direct training of a Postdoctoral Researcher, a Graduate Student, Undergraduate Students and High School Students in a lab with a proven track record of providing meaningful research experiences for trainees. Participants will work on an important, fundamental biological problem using integrative computational and molecular genetics approaches developed for the powerful model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The high school students will be recruited though the Young Nebraska Scientists and Nebraska College Preparatory Academy programs which emphasizes broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key regulated step in gene expression is mRNA decay which determines a mRNA's lifespan.  Protein are made by translation of a single mRNA repeatedly to produce multiple proteins.  In part, the amount of protein made is dependent on the mRNA lifespan because this determines how much of each type of mRNA is available for translation and how many times each mRNA is translated.  Each mRNA has a specific lifespan, and for many mRNAs lifespan is modulated in response to environmental or intracellular changes.  mRNA decay rates are determined by interactions between cis-elements within the mRNAs and the mRNA decay machinery.  RNA binding proteins can mediate these interactions.  However, little is known about how these interactions lead to functional changes in the rate at which an mRNA is degraded.  The objective of this project was to identify mechanisms that permit wild type mRNAs with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) targeting signals to evade the NMD pathway.  NMD is a specialized pathway that is responsible for the recognition and rapid degradation of mRNAs with premature stop codons and some wild type mRNAs as well.  However not all wild type mRNAs with NMD targeting cis-elements are degraded by the NMD pathway.\n\nPoly(U) binding protein (Pub1) is an RNA binding protein that was reported to protect two wild type mRNAs with NMD targeting signals, the GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs, from NMD.  The Pub1 RNA binding domain most closely looks like that of a second RNA binding protein, Poly(A) binding protein (Pab1)  Pab1 is important for determining which mRNAs will be degraded by the NMD pathway.  Pub1 and Pab1 also interact with an overlapping set of proteins all of which function in translation, NMD and mRNA decay.  We showed that Pub1 can protect a mRNA with a premature termination codon from NMD  by fooling the cell into thinking that it does not have an NMD targeting signal.  In addition, we found that Pub1 is required for changes in mRNA metabolism during response to stress.  This creates a new opportunity to study conditional regulation of mRNA stability. \n\nUpstream open reading frames (uORFs) occur naturally in some mRNAs.  For example, three mRNAs we worked with in this research have uORFs &ndash; GCN4, YAP1 and SSY5 mRNAs.  uORFs can reduce how much protein is made from an mRNA by acting as a decoy for the translation initiation machinery as well as target mRNAs for rapid decay by the NMD pathway.  However not all uORFs affect translation or mRNA stability.  We do not yet have a complete understanding of what determines whether a uORF will reduce translation and target mRNAs for NMD.  To begin addressing this question, we created a database that combines information about uORF position and function.  We also developed a uORF translation likelihood predictor tool, a mathematical model that predicts the effect of uORFs on native gene expression.  This tool will enable design of synthetic mRNAs with uORFs tuned to produce precise amounts of protein. \n\nLastly, we studied the decay of SSY5 mRNA, a mRNA with multiple NMD targeting signals that is not degraded by NMD.  We showed that the four mechanisms known to protect other mRNAs from NMD do not account for the protection of SSY5 mRNA.  Instead this mRNA is protected by a novel mechanism.  We further showed that this mRNA is protected at a very early step before mRNA decay actually begins. This work sets the stage for future targeted investigation into the mechansims that protect this mRNA from NMD.\n\nThis project impacted human resource development through the direct training of diverse group of trainees including two Postdoctoral Researchers, two Graduate Students, nine Undergraduate Students and three High School Students.  These participants worked on important, fundamental biological problem using integrative computational and molecular genetics approaches developed for the powerful model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae more commonly known of as bakers? yeast.  One Postdoctoral Researcher is now an Assistant Professor and the other is in a medical professional program.  Seven Undergraduate Students graduated and two are finishing their undergraduate degrees.  Of the Undergraduate Students who graduated, five are working in science or engineering jobs.  Two continued on to medical professional programs.  Two High School Students were recruited though the Young Nebraska Scientists and Nebraska College Preparatory Academy programs which emphasizes broadening participation.  Both of these students continued to participate in the research project after starting their undergraduate degrees. The third High School Student has just begun undergraduate studies and already plans to do graduate studies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Audrey L Atkin"
