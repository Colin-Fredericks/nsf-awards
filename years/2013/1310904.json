 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Gengen Friday He of The University of Tennessee to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic sciences area, during the summer of 2013 at The University of Tokyo in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.  The project title is \"Investigating Collaborative Simultaneous Wayfinding in a Culturally Unfamiliar Setting.\" The host scientist is Dr. Toru Ishikawa.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly more culturally diverse and spatially complex world, little is known about a city's cultural-specific-landscape effect on the way people navigate, or what types of spatial information are communicated during navigation.  This project is investigating how foreigners and local residents acquire, interpret, process and communicate spatial information during active simultaneous collaborative wayfinding in a Japanese City.  This is a novel experimental setup that combines cognitive behavioral spatial science with geographic information science to understand the interaction between people, environment and technology.   This study re-examines and synthesizes theories in cognitive psychology, the spatial information acquisition process, landmark recognition, active navigation, and communication.  Furthermore, this study can make a practical contribution to designing better navigation aids for foreigners in Japan and help to create more navigation friendly cities for immigrants and visitors in America.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  The results from this study can add to the understanding of human cognitive process.  This study also has the potential to make practical contributions to the development of better navigation aids in Japan.  Ultimately, this can also lead to the design of more navigation friendly cities for foreigner and immigrants in America.",

The project recruited more than 30 participants from 14 different countries during the span of eight weeks.  The project used a novel experimental setup to gain understanding and insight into the basic human activity of collaborative navigation, a phenomenon which has not been sufficiently examined.    In this project setup, two people at a time were first guided on two routes that shared a starting point, after reaching the predefined destination and returning, the two switched routes and helped each other navigate the other route over a cell phone.  The conversations as well as the thought process during solo navigation are recorded and analyzed.  Actions and behaviors during the navigation are recorded by the P.I and cross analyzed along with a self reported sense of ability survey.   This study attempts to draw a more complete picture of the dynamic process of the environmental perception, cognitive processing and communication of spatial information involved during a challenging, important and common daily activity.  The experiment is especially challenging due to the fact the participants are all non-Japanese residents unfamiliar with the neighborhood selected.  This cultural unfamiliarity heightens the cognitive process used by the participants, highlights the salience of the environment, upregulated the selection of important landmarks and illustrates the importance of strategies.  \nPreliminary results from the experiment have shown that it is not simply just the inherent ability of the participants that affect the outcome of the research, for example, people with high spatial abilities don't necessarily perform more efficiently if paired with people of lower spatial scores.  The difference in perception, navigation strategy and communication of spatial information that has a large effect on the outcome of the navigation.  On the other hand, people with similarity in perception and common grounds in communication have been shown to outperform in proportion to their self reported sense of direction abilities.  In other words, people who with less adequate spatial abilities can benefit more from a set of directions and communications that fit their own spatial thinking and environmental perception models.  This study has important implications in the design of personalized guidances, navigation aids, as well as designing more navigation friendly cities for tourists and immigrants.   \nThis funding provided an opportunity for the P.I to engage in this novel research while establishing long term collaborations with Japanese counterparts for future research and academic exchange.
