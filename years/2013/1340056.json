 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is providing scholarships to 39 academically talented transfer students from the Alamo Community College District preparing to become science and mathematics teachers.  The effort will involve a partnership of the College of Sciences, the College of Education and Human Development, schools within the Alamo Community College District and several local high needs school districts in and around San Antonio, Texas.\r\n \r\nThe program follows a previously established model at UTSA shown to be successful with students majoring in STEM within UTSA.  The Generating Educational Excellence in Math and Science (GE2MS) program is providing pre-service teachers with mentoring and academic support to effectively integrate the students into the pre-service activities at UTSA (including a summer bridging institute) while providing the students the opportunity to participate in a rigorous science and mathematics preparation program.  In addition, project personnel are offering continuing support for the new teachers including access to induction support services offered by the Academy for Teacher Excellence (ATE) and Career Transitioning Guidance (CTG), and conducting regular online sessions through an eCommunity of Practice to provide support, advice, mentoring and help with curricular challenges encountered by new teachers.  The evaluation of the Noyce GE2MS program is also providing information on the efficacy of mentoring and academic support and to inform how these activities can be structured to increase the recruitment and retention of highly qualified secondary STEM teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA common route for college education is to start at a Community College and then transfer to a Four-Year Institution for the final two years and a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  Nationally, nearly 80% of students attending community college have this as a goal but only 25% attempt the transfer.  While this approach can save the students money and give them more faculty attention due to smaller class size, it can also restrict their exposure to future opportunities since the schools are concentrated on the first two years of college.  One area where this can cause problems is students interested in secondary science and math education.  To enter this career, the student must complete the requirements of the science or math Bachelor\u2019s degree plus teaching certification.  There are programs, such as UTeach, that coordinate the curriculum so students can achieve both goals in 4 years.  However, the students need to begin the program in their first or second year to finish on time.  Transfer students cannot start the program until their third year and often need to spend additional time in college to be certified to enter the workforce.  In the UTeach program at our institution, we found that around half of the participants had started in community college and needed to stay an additional semester or year to achieve their needed credentials.  If they were able to start the program in community college, then they should be able to finish in the four year window.  The goal of our project was to recruit students while they were in community college and start them in the UTeach program during their first or second year.  In addition, we provided financial, social and mentoring support for these community college transfer students to increase the likelihood of them graduating and entering the secondary education workforce.  Our intellectual merit was to evaluate the effectiveness of these supports in increasing the number of science and math students who enter teaching as a career.  Our broader impact was to increase the number of science and math teachers serving high need schools.\n    Over the course of 7 years, 32 students participated in the program.  Seventeen were underrepresented minorities. All had sufficient financial need that they qualified for Pell grants.  They received up to $10,000/year in scholarship support.  They took classes together and had a dedicated advisor.  They met regularly with program personnel to discuss career goals and future plans.  They were assigned to a mentor teacher from a local school district so they could learn more about a career in K-12 education.  Seventeen are currently teaching in high needs schools and eight are still enrolled to complete their degree.  Initially, we recruited students who majored in STEM fields at community college to take UTeach introductory classes before they transferred.  This did not generate many participants so we began to recruit students who had already transferred to UTSA.  \n    Through our interactions and interviews with an external evaluator, we learned about factors increasing retention.  The students credited the financial aid as being a major factor.  The funds decreased stress and increased their ability to focus on classes.  They also credited feelings of belonging due to connections with the project PIs, mentors and fellow students.  \n    Our difficulty in recruiting from the community colleges was an important lesson.  The large number of graduates who had started in community college made us feel that there was a large pool of interested future science and math teachers there.  Instead, we found that many transferred to the four-year institution with the expectation of attending medical school or other professional programs and only when their grades declined did they consider teaching as a career.  Recruiting future teachers from the community college student pool will require more direct interactions and exposure to teaching as a viable career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
