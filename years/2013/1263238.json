 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop the \"Earth, Life, and Atmosphere\" (ELiA) interdisciplinary geoscience community of thirty pre-service teachers, two in-service teachers, and six Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) faculty. This community will collaborate in research and teaching within the context of solving environmental geoscience problems in the southeastern United States. Prior to each of the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015, ELiA will recruit five Earth science pre-service middle school or high school teachers and three chemistry and two biology pre-service high school teachers from a national applicant pool. During a nine-week summertime interval, the pre-service teachers will use laboratories at MTSU and field sites near the university which is located fifty kilometers southeast of downtown Nashville. The participants will explore geologic structures which provide pathways for groundwater flow, investigate surface water quality, explore rare cedar glade plant communities, experiment with ways to reduce the environmental impact of pavement, and improve understanding of ground-level ozone. While engaging in scientific research, the pre-service teachers will also come to appreciate the role of geology during the pivotal first day of the American Civil War Battle of Stones River, appreciate the role of geology and botany in the lives of rural African Americans after the war, and better understand the environmental impact of suburban development. In addition to engaging in scientific research and widely disseminating the results, ELiA will develop and disseminate two pre-college educational modules. ELiA will disseminate results through social media (including YouTube), a website, an on-line newsletter, ArcServer, Google Earth files, presentations at meetings, and journal articles.\r\n\r\nThis award will contribute to society by helping people better-understand their environment and how to live as a part of it. In addition, the project will also benefit society by training pre-service STEM teachers who will, in turn, train numerous pre-college students. The proposed project will improve understanding of the geology, plant ecology, and air quality at Stones River National Battlefield near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and geological and plant ecological data will contribute to the planning of historical archeology investigations in the park.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  \"Geoenvironmental Challenges\" was the National Science Foundation Geosciences Directorate?s first Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site designed exclusively for future middle school and high school science teachers.  The project recruited cohorts of ten undergraduates and recent college graduates for each of the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015.  The applicant pool was national and competitive with participants hailing from institutions in 15 states and Puerto Rico (Fig. 1).  Participants (Figs. 2-5) were predominantly female (67%), and 37% were members of under-represented minority groups.  Of the 30 participants, 8 were each affiliated with one of 6 minority-serving institutions.  The project was based at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and mostly utilized field sites and laboratories in or close to MTSU.\n\n  During all three years, participants were involved in Earth Science, chemistry, air quality, and plant ecology research for approximately seven of nine weeks.  Participants primarily investigated scientific problems in pairs mentored by one or two MTSU faculty members who were assisted in some cases by MTSU staff, undergraduates, and graduate students.  In addition, the participants spent a week at Mammoth Cave and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks (GSMNP).  Over the duration of the project, this component came to consist primarily of ranger-led programming with a large amount of citizen science at GSMNP.  Also, one project objective was to expand undergraduate learning about sustainability at MTSU, and an enduring outcome of that component is ongoing use of National Science Foundation Integrated Teaching about Earth for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) educational materials by up to 145 Introduction to Earth Science students each semester.\n\n  After completing the summer experience, most participants presented posters or gave talks at the Geological Society of America Annual Meeting.  The REU Site generated 24 presentations, and one of the Earth Science investigations contributed substantially to a peer-reviewed technical field guide to the Harpeth River and Stones River fault zones, central Tennessee.  Although the primary focus of the project was mentored undergraduate science research, the 2014 cohort developed K-12 materials, and a self-selecting sub-group of eight 2013-2015 participants re-united on-line for 2 weeks during Summer 2016 to develop additional materials.\n\n  Relative to participants in a nationwide survey of undergraduate researchers, the \"Geoenvironmental Challenges\" participants as a whole consistently reported large gains in \"confidence in my potential as a teacher\" and \"scientific assertions require supporting evidence.\"  To better-document the participant experience, most 2015 participants contributed to pre- and post-experience focus groups and wrote an end-of-experience paper.  Mention of research, field trips, and field research dominated focus group summaries.  The end-of-experience papers mostly described participant plans to implement citizen science projects, research in lesson plans, and scientifically educational field trips when they become teachers (Fig. 6).\n\n  Participant presentations show that the project has already influenced K-12 learning.  Examples:\n\nExperienced classroom Earth Science teacher Jerri Birkofer participated in Summer 2016 on-line curriculum development and some Summer 2015 activities, although she was not a part of the 2015 cohort.  At Stewarts Creek High School, she has used what she helped develop during Summer 2016 in combination with a local field trip and explorations of local history and environmental issues.\nParticipant Brandi Bomar used what she learned during Summer 2014 to educate students ages 6-10 at the Summer 2015 \"Day Camp\" at the Salvation Army?s Magness-Potter Community Center in Nashville, TN.  Ms. Bomar is now enrolled in the master?s program in sustainability at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN.\nWhile student teaching during the 2013-2014 academic year, Summer 2013 participant Anthony Mims used field photographs to provide urban Pennsylvania K-12 students with visuals for the vocabulary words they learned while reading the story \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" in their basal reader. Photographs included images of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky and snakes encountered while collecting field data in the cedar glades of central Tennessee.  Mr. Mims is now a 7th grade science teacher in Elkton, Maryland.  During his first year of teaching, he took students to a nearby stream to investigate water quality.  Two students accompanied him to a local library to share their results with the public.      \nDuring Summer 2013 Mammoth Cave piqued the interest of participant Joe Camacho.  Then, during Summer 2014, he interned with the National Park Service, playing a major role in developing Junior Cave Ranger educational materials.  In 2017, Mr. Camacho earned a Master in Teaching degree from the University of Washington.\n\n\n \n\nPeer-reviewed publication\n\nAbolins, M., Young, S., Camacho, J., Trexler, M., Ward, A., Cooley, M., and Ogden, A., 2015, A road guide to the Harpeth River and Stones River fault zones on the northwest flank of the Nashville dome, central Tennessee, in Holmes, A.E., ed., Diverse Excursions in the Southeast: Paleozoic to Present: Geological Society of America Field Guide 39, p. 1&ndash;20, doi:10.1130/2015.0039(01).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark J Abolins"
