 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and evolution of the Eastern North America margin are the focus of this GeoPRISMS community seismic experiment. The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. \r\n\r\nA year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the onshore, active-source component of the ENAM Community Seismic Experiment (CSE).  The goals of the ENAM CSE are to acquire a seismic dataset that the community at large can use to address scientific questions related to the rifting processes that shaped the U.S. east coast margin and the subsequent evolution of this rifted margin.  The design of the CSE is such that the particular funding grant does not include funds to address specific scientific questions, but rather provides a dataset that will enable a range of questions to be addressed, with those questions being articulated in proposals to be written based on the existing dataset.\n\nThe particular award to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), as part of the larger collaborative grant, supported the acquisition of seismic data onshore.  This onshore work was done by WHOI along with scientists from Southern Methodist University (SMU) and the University of Texas El Paso, and with the support of 23 graduate students from around the U.S.  The onshore effort had two main components: 1) the onshore recording of seismic sources originating offshore, and 2) the onshore recording of onshore seismic sources.  Both of those components were very successful, and the resulting datasets are available from public domain datacenters.\n\nTogether, the onshore and offshore efforts of the ENAM CSE produced a seismic dataset with the potential to image Earth?s crust and upper mantle along two ~700-km-long profiles that are each about half onshore and half offshore.  These profiles will thus image the transition from continental to oceanic crust.  These images will provide information on how the supercontinent of Pangea rifted apart, separating North America from Africa and creating the Atlantic ocean.  This type of continental rifting event is important to the habitability of our planet, but the geodynamic processes involved in continental rifting are currently poorly understood.\n\nAs a Community experiment, the data acquired during the ENAM CSE are open to all scientists to explore and use for discovery.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Lizarralde"
