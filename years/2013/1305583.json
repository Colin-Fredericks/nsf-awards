The deposited metals, amounting to few atomic layers thick, tend to self-organize into nanoscale features, such as atomic wires, stripes, mesas, pyramids, or even ultrasmooth films, because of quantum confinement and boundary effects. These nanostructures often exhibit unusual properties that are not intuitively connected to the behavior of the metals in the bulk form. The underlying nanoscale science is a key basis for developing new material and device configurations relevant to technological and industrial advances. The research will focus on the connections between the stability, shapes, and sizes of the nanostructures and the electronic structure and chemical properties of the system, with the intent to derive a general understanding and design rules for guiding system fabrication and functionalization. The experimental tools will include angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction, and much of the work will be performed at national synchrotron-radiation facilities. This research bridges basic science and applications, and provides opportunities for education and training of students, postdoctoral research associates, and visiting scholars in the use of modern tools for materials synthesis and characterization. The experiences will position them well for careers in scientific research, education, technology, and industry.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nThis project is a study of the atomic-scale structure and behavior of composite systems prepared by atomic deposition, artificial layering, and controlled heat treatment of metals on the most common electronic substrate materials including silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide.

This project is a study of the electronic structure, morphology, stability, and atomistic behavior of selected surface-based nanoscale systems prepared by deposition, artificial layering, self-assembly, and self-organization. The systems of interest include various elemental and alloy films prepared on surfaces that are smooth, stepped, or modulated by nanowire arrays. The systems are chosen for their broad scientific and technological relevance. Specifically, stepped and modulated surfaces provide opportunities of property tuning by controlling the Fermi surface topology. The primary tools for the proposed work include angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and x-ray diffraction and scattering (XRD). Many of the experiments are carried out at national facilities. Generally, electrons confined in nanoscale systems form discrete states, or quantum well states, with energies and wave functions dependent sensitively on the physical dimensions and boundary conditions. As a result, the electronic properties including the total energy, charge and spin distributions, density of states, and electronic transport can exhibit substantial quantum variations as a function of system size and environment. The lattice structure in turn responds to these variations, possibly leading to structural distortions, symmetry-breaking transformations, and novel configurations. These electron-lattice coupling effects are strongly enhanced at the nanoscale partly because of quantum coherence and interference. Additionally, as the solid-vacuum boundaries are often soft, the atoms and the accompanying electrons may readily morph or diffuse to adopt new configurations corresponding to the local minima in a complex multi-dimensional free-energy landscape. Such electronically driven transformations are enhanced at elevated temperatures, where fluctuation, entropy, and kinetic effects come into play. The system may undergo atomic reorganization and structural evolution with details that are difficult to predict based on the known bulk behavior alone. These effects and phenomena, of central importance to nano and mesoscale science and technology, are the focus of our research.
