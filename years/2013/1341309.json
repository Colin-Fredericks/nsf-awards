 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel stipends for students to participate in Doctoral Consortium (July 22, 2013) and in the 2013 ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2013),  to be held in Indianapolis, Indiana, June 23-25, 2013 (http://www.jcdl2013.org). The selected PhD students are in the early stages of their dissertation work and several international students are included in order to provide breadth in exchanging ideas. The goal of the consortium is to help students develop their dissertation proposals and research plans through feedback and guidance from prominent researchers and experienced practitioners from the field of digital library research and development. The JCDL Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for Ph.D. students to interact with major leaders in the digital library community. These international leaders exemplify a broad set of expertise, diversity of perspectives, and wealth of knowledge. The consortium provides students with an opportunity to have broad audience and interact intellectually with professionals who would otherwise be difficult to meet with. Participating students will be selected on the basis of a paper describing their research. At the consortium, participants will have approximately 40 minutes to present their research plans and receive feedback from the panel. After the consortium the students will revise their papers based on the consortium's feedback and then they will be published in the IEEE Technical Committee on Digital Libraries publication \"TCDL Bulletin\" (http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/mediawiki/TCDL/index.php/IEEE-TCDL).\r\n\r\nParticipation in JCDL 2013 Doctoral Consortium and conference will expose the selected students as well as other attending students to a larger community, extend their opportunities for intellectual engagement, and encourage scholarly discourse and networking among new entrants into the field.  The goal is to help shape ongoing and future teaching, research, and development projects in the field of digital libraries by providing wider exposure for the students to innovative ideas which may generate new research questions in the future, and to foster a sense of community among these young researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. The organizers will also take special steps to solicit participation from institutions with underrepresented groups to extend the potential benefits and broaden the horizon of expertise in the field.",
