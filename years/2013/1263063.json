 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site program will engage undergraduate students in basic research and provide laboratory experience in transportation electrification-related engineering projects performed with research mentors from University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP). The program is aimed at training students and promoting skills in them to become independent researchers by providing insights into research methodologies, self-discipline, team integration, and exposing them to the broader implications of their research. Ethics discussion and training will be integrated into all aspects of the students' experience. At the end of the program the participants will make formal presentations and also submit their work to the NSF Engineering Education Awardees Conference, and other conferences and journals including IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed project is to provide undergraduate students with a strong academic background and research experience focusing on sustainable transportation systems, which is the common intellectual focus of the program. The program will enhance the practical and theoretical foundation of students in the areas of power electronics, energy storage (battery, ultracapacitor and fuel cell), optimization and mathematical modeling of grid integrated vehicles, and sustainable transportations by exploring creative, original, and transformative concepts. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The main broader impact is ensuring highest quality integrated education and research to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. transportation and energy industries by educating young and talented undergraduate students. The results will be disseminated broadly through professional conferences and meetings to enhance scientific and educational achievements. It is essential to point out that since the transportation industry is going through a major restructuring to introduce next generation of electrified vehicles, it is critical to train young minds in this field. The integrated research and educational activities will certainly facilitate this objective. It is the intention of the project team to diversify the number of participants, specifically from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThere are over 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% green house gas and 70% of emissions comes from transportation and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of the fuel, which is petroleum. Considering the fact that oil and gas are finite resources, which are becoming scant and expensive, there is no doubt that advanced electrified automotive systems are one of the ways of independency to oil. In fact, as identified by Electrification Coalition, transportation electrification is an inevitable path towards nation?s independence from oil and achieving energy security. Hence, it is vital to prepare the future STEM workforce to tackle grand challenges of national and global significance. \r\n\r\nThis REU program, funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, through award ENG-EEC-1263063, will ensure highest quality of integrated education and research to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. transportation and energy industries. It is aimed at training, educating, and inspiring undergraduate students to tackle such challenges, and convey to them the need for superior, passionate researchers in the field of transportation electrification. Efforts will be made to recruit a diverse pool of students from underrepresented groups in engineering. The participants will be exposed to broader implications of their research and training through technical and professional development seminars, field trips to national laboratories and tours of industrial facilities. The results of our experiences will be shared with interested universities, colleges, high schools, industries, and government organizations. The outcomes will be disseminated in national and international journals, conferences, and relevant workshops.",
