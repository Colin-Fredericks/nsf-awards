The conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers, students through senior scientists, working in post-wildfire and erosion response as well as fire-behavior, meso-scale meteorology, soil science, hydrology, geomorphology, and modeling.  The conference will have five sessions:  post-wildfire response domains; precipitation; infiltration; runoff; soil and sediment erosion and transport.  Outcomes from the conference include a pre-conference review paper of current priority research issues facing the post-wildfire community; an AGU monograph of invited and submitted papers; and journal publications on proposed solutions for priority research issues of each topic session.  The conference will have strong participation from students and early career researchers.",
