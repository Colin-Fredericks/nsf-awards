At this meeting the                      state-of-the-art on flooding, erosion, and sediment transport science           and technology will be examined, and a research agenda for cooperative          activities between the two countries will be developed.  A team of 10           U.S scientists, selected from the fields of hydraulics, sediment                transport, physical geography, atmospheric sciences, hydrology, and             others, will meet with Chinese researchers with similar specialists.            The topics for discussion will include:  flood forecasting, transport           and deposition of hyperconcentrated sediments, accelerated erosion, and         mitigation measures, among others.  Papers on these topics will be              presented during the first part of the workshop and will serve as a             base for the discussion sessions.  Proceedings will be published which          will include the prepared papers and the results of the deliberations.",
