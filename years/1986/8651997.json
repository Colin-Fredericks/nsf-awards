 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California Museum of Science and Industry will create a 3,000 square        foot permanent exhibition of hands-on participatory exhibits on                 chemistry and chemical phenomena that will allow visitors to manipulate         the variables of chemical systems.  Forty exhibit units will be                 organized in clusters in that represent the basic concepts of properties        of atoms and molecules, molecular structure and chemical reactions,             stability of molecules and rates of reactions, forces between atoms and         molecules and energy of atoms and molecules.                                                                                                                    The exhibition will use state-of-the-art technology to present chemical         experiments previously left to the lab bench or the demonstration table.        Interactive computers and videodiscs will be used where danger or               complexity prevents the visitor from using \"the real thing.\"  Exhibit           content will be proved in prototype form and tested on museum staff,            visitors, and school groups prior to final design and construction.  NSF        support will be used in the design and prototype phases, and an \"exhibit        cookbook\" of exhibit technologies for use by other museums will be              created.                                                                                                                                                        The project has already attracted more than $175,000 of matching funds          towards a total of $800,000 in non-NSF matching funds to support its            $1,100,000 budget.",
