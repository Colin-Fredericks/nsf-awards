 "awd_abstract_narration": "The March 3, 1985 Chile earthquake presents a special opportunity to            study the adequacy of current design methods for buildings in seismic           zones.  Many buildings of modern construciton that were affected by the         shock were designed for lateral forces comparable to those used on the          West Coast of the United States.  Six buildings (three heavily damaged          and three undamaged or lightly damaged) are studied for analytical              methods for design, evaluation, and structural details.  Experimental           study is conducted to establish the effectiveness of three-dimensional          framing systems in the buildings.  This project is prepared as part of          a cooperatve research program to study effects of the Chilean                   earthquake on building structures.",
