 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deliver in-service training to 75 elementary school           teachers each year for a period of two years.  Participants will be             drawn from several School Districts in New York City.  The aim of the           program is to improve physical science literacy and to provide                  techniques and strategies for the inclusion of current hands-on                 materials into classrooms.                                                                                                                                      Two workshops will be conducted.  Comfortable Physics Workshop I will           introduce and explain those topics necessary to make elementary teachers        comfortable with physics.                                                                                                                                       Comfortable Physics Workshop II will bridge the gap between the physical        concepts and the laboratory apparatus of Workshop I and the elementary          school classroom.                                                                                                                                               Workshop participants will meet for three hours each week for 15 weeks          during the school year--more often during the summer months.                                                                                                    In addition to lecture, lecture demonstrations, and hands-on laboratory         work in both workshops, a project will be required of each participants.",
