 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment purchased through this award is being used to enable students         to investigate principles of molecular biology through the development          of laboratory experiments and independent research projects.  Specific          objectives are to include the basic theoretical principles of molecular         genetics, gene fusions and molecular biochemistry in the Department's           Genetics course and also in Biochemistry -- a course offered jointly by         the Biology and Chemistry departments.  The need is to provide a \"hands-        on\" laboratory experience in these courses in order to directly                 illustrate important theoretical principles, while greatly expanding            opportunities for students who enroll in the undergraduate research             program.  The project will enable Roberts Wesleyan students for the             first time to participate in the development of reproducible experiments        in molecular biology.  One feature of the effort is the introduction it         provides advanced majors to the rapidly expanding field of recombinant          DNA technology.",
