 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of a computer laboratory for              applied and computational mathematics.  A number of recent national             reports have stressed the need for stronger emphasis on computational           mathematics education.  The laboratory will enhance San Jose State              University's applied mathematics and computational mathematics courses          by providing them with a good laboratory component where students can           carry out numerical experiments and see illustrations of results in             applied mathematics.                                                                                                                                            In addition the lab will provide support for San Jose State's innovative        Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Clinic.  The purpose of the            Clinic is to give students the opportunity to do real-world problem             solving as part of a team in a setting which is not usually encountered         in undergraduate education. Problems arising in the Clinic are usually          complex and evolve as the problems are studied.  For such problems              substantial computing power is required.                                                                                                                        The laboratory will consist of 8 IBM AT microcomputers and DSI co-              processor and memory boards.  This combination will result in a machine         much faster than the basic computer and with 4 MB of memory.",
