 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will address the challenges in earthquake hazard                  mitigation involving siting and geotechnical systems, and the basic             research that is needed to address these challenges.  Emphasis will be          given to identifying especially innovative ideas, or ideas involving            high risk/high return which would generally be considered too risky to          receive unqualified peer approval.  Approximately 100 participants are          expected to attend, with one half being current grantees of the Siting          and Geotechnical Systems Program, while the remainder will be drawn             from academe, industry, national laboratories, distinguished foreign            researchers, and representatives from the funding agencies.  The                participants will be divided into groups of approximately 10 people,            and each group will address a current challenge in earthquake hazard            mitigation and will be charged with identifying and recording the steps         to be taken to meet this challenge.",
