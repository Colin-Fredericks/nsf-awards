 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a vacuum evaporator, an ultra-microtome, and a glass         knife maker under this project will enhance the opportunities for               undergraduates to conduct laboratory research using the University's            transmission electron microscope.  Students from the Departments of             Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Geology, and the fiber-optics and pre-        engineering options will have the opportunity to participate in projects        using the electron microscope.                                                                                                                                  Further, the electron microscope projects will link together all levels         of interdisciplinary research activities at the University.  It is              expected that this approach will enhance the research skills of the             undergraduates; increase activity and cohesion among all student levels         across departments and disciplines; and increase undergraduate                  participation at scientific meetings and in the preparation of                  manuscripts submitted for publication.  The project will also combine           existing senior research courses, as well as a planned new course in            Electron Microscopy, into a continuous learning process spanning the            undergraduate years.",
