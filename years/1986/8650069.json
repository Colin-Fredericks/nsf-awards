 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johns Hopkins University proposes to analyze data collected in a                national survey of instructional uses of school computers.  The data            were collected in a survey, sponsored by the U. S. Department of                Education, of 2,336 schools involving mailed questionnaires to                  principals and up to seven teachers per school, selected according to           subject matter and computer use. The study provides important                   descriptive and analytical data for understanding and improving how             U. S. secondary schools spend scarce resources on computers for                 instructional uses.                                                                                                                                             The analyses that form the basis of this proposal consist of a series of        reports to be produced over a 12 month period.  Report topics are               directly related to secondary mathematics, science, and computer                education. Specific report topics include:  basic descriptive data on           instructional uses of school computers; differences in access, use, and         perceived impact among different categories of students (i.e.,                  male/female and above-average, average, and below-average achieving             students); use of computers in mathematics classes to teach algebra,            geometry, trigonometry, analysis, general math, and statistics and              probability; courses in computer programming; and, a summary and                interpretation of trends, problems, and opportunities for using                 computers in secondary school mathematics, science and computer                 education.",
