The exhibition will cover the history of life on earth, how scientists          recognize and evaluate change through time, the scientific method and           process of discovering, and the impact of evolution.  A teacher's               educational resource kit with hands-on materials will be developed for          use in the schools along with teacher training courses.                                                                                                         The exhibition will reach a substantial audience, over a million and a          half visitors per year.  Additionally, 44% of the San Francisco                 elementary school children are visited each year by Academy docents, the        mobile classroom reaches 7,000 Bay Area residents, over 5,000 children          and adults take classes at the Academy and 10,000 school children visit         the museum each year.",
