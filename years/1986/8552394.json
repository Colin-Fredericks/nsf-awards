 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University College at Cortland is offering a three-component          program to improve science education in grades K-3 in school districts          within a 60-mile radius of the University.  The program includes one-day        science Exploratoriums for educators and the public to focus on the             needs and possible solutions for improved science education, an                 intensive two-week Summer Institute for four-member teams consisting of         K-3 teachers and an administrator from 10 regional participating school         districts, and an implementation project which will promote and support         quality science instruction in the District's primary grades.                                                                                                   The 84 participants will be involved through hands-on inquiry                   experiences with multidisciplinary science concepts, methodologies which        encourage basic skills through science instruction, activities which            encourage participation of girls and minorities in science, and the             innovative use of technology to enhance K-3 instruction.  Experienced           peer teachers will be involved in the instruction as well as in the             follow-up on-site visits.  An interesting part of the project involves          the training of parents and intermediate-age school children as lab             aides to further assist the classroom teacher in conducting a good              experiential program for the primary grade children.",
