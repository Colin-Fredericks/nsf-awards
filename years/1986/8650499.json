 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will incorporate high performance liquid chromatography            (HPLC) into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Jacksonville              University.  HPLC instrumentation will be used by students in Separation        Chemistry and Advanced Experimental Chemistry, and for undergraduate            research projects.  In addition, the HPLC system will be used for               special projects by students in the Biology and Marine Science                  Departments.  Experiments in the laboratory courses include                     investigations of operating parameters; use of ultraviolet, refractive          index, and electrochemical detectors; and design of a separation system         for analysis of a \"real world\" sample with a complex matrix.  Research          projects include joint endeavors between the Chemistry and Marine               Science Departments to analyze various pollutants in the St. Johns              River, a project to develop a more versatile electrochemical detector           for liquid chromatography, studies on rearrangements of ephedrine               derivatives and oxidation of phospholipids, and isolation of natural            products from marine algae.  This project will enhance students'                appreciation for the capabilities of HPLC, a powerful modern technique,         and develop their expertise in the design and application of                    chromatographic separations.",
