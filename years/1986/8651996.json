 "awd_abstract_narration": "The St. Louis Science Center is a major metropolitan science museum             serving a population of 2.3 million people.  One year ago they moved            into a new facility at a new location and attendance at the museum has          tripled, reaching 600,00 visitors this past year.                                                                                                               The center will develop a \"Science Playground\" in order to teach basic          science principles and process through a series of 45 outdoor                   participatory exhibitions around the major areas of motion, energy,             light, sound and the natural environment.  The physics of motion will be        explored through exhibits such as a friction slide, lunar gravity swing,        double-axis human pendulum, etc.  Energy exhibits will provide                  experiences with watermills and water power, fulcrum leverage and solar         energy.  Light exploration includes a solar column, prisms and rainbows,        soundwheel and whisper discs. A weather station will have a rain gauge,         anemometer, a variety of barometers, etc.                                                                                                                       This contemporary playground concept was developed as a response to             limitations of indoor facilities and to extend use of outdoor space in a        creative manner.  The exhibit will be a model for extending science             learning opportunities for schools, parks, other science museums and            similar institutions.  The center surveyed 31 science centers, 82 parks         and 85 school districts to gauge interest in use of science playground          exhibits, and found a clear interest in this type of project by all             sectors surveyed.  Exhibit designs will be published and furnished at           cost to any facility wishing to replicate all or any part of the                exhibition.",
