The            award will effectively put the 1-1/2-year-old experimental program onto         sound footing as a permanent offering of the department.  The requested         equipment includes state-of-the-art microscopes, ultracentrifuges, an           enzyme-linked immunoassay reader, fermentation apparatus, incubator, and        a biohazard safety cabinet. During its first eighteen months, the               program has attracted 20 majors and 178 other students.  While still on         a trial footing, it has placed more than a dozen graduates into                 positions in the local bio-technology industry.",
