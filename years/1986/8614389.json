 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop a complete exhibition kit on          the topic of biological diversity that can be used in a wide variety of         settings, including schools, museums and libraries.  The kit will               include a series of poster panels, an accompanying audio-visual                 presentation, and an owner's manual that includes programs and ideas for        educators to use in conjunction with the exhibit.  The exhibition will          be developed by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service        (SITES), building on a National Forum on BioDiversity to be sponsored           jointly by the Smithsonian and the National Academy of Sciences in              September 1986.                                                                                                                                                 The objective of this exhibit is to educate the public about the need to        maintain global biological diversity, the ways in which it is currently         threatened, and steps to preserve diversity of organisms and                    environments. Each year, due to a wide variety of factors, including            development, population increase, movement of peoples, and poor                 agricultural practices, the planet is losing both habitats and living           species.  The loss of tropical forests, advancing desertification in            many areas, depletion of agricultural soils, and polluting of the ocean         are serious problems for all countries.  Preserving biological diversity        is a subject that has been the fundamental principal guiding                    conservation strategies for the last two decades, but there has never           before been a comprehensive exhibit on this topic in the kind of easily         accessible format proposed by the Smithsonian Institution.                                                                                                      This project is funded jointly with the Directorate for Biological,             Behavioral and Social Sciences.",
