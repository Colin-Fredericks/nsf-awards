 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at Furman will purchase five 8-inch and one 14-          inch astronomical telescopes and other laboratory equipment for                 astronomy.  The equipment is to serve three main purposes.  The primary         use is in the laboratory portion of an introductory astronomy course, a         course which is taught at a level suitable for non-science majors.  Some        of the equipment is for indoor, on-campus use, whereas other items will         be permanently installed in a modest observatory which is to be                 constructed by Furman at a mountain location a few miles north of               Greenville, South Carolina.  Second, the laboratories which are made            possible through this project will provide valuable teaching experiences        for the student assistants who will be involved.  Finally, the new              astronomy facilities will be made available, as are existing facilities,        to local school, civic, church, and other groups for demonstrations,            laboratory exercises, science projects, and observing sessions.",
