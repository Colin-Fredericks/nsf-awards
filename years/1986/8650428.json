 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interdisciplinary biotechnology programs at Manhattan College and at        the College of Mount Saint Vincent are being expanded and improved at           both institutions by the addition of a required fermentation laboratory         component for students majoring in chemical engineering and biology.            This facility is housed at Manhattan College.  Six experiments are being        developed in bacterial fermentation, yeast production, continuous               centrifugation, continuous cell disruption, precipitation and                   chromatography.  The recent acquisition of a stirred-tank fermentor and         an airlift fermentor is providing students with experience in state-of-         the-art equipment in biotechnology.  The Biotechnology Advisory Council,        composed of members of the Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering          Departments from both institutions plus corporate consultants, assures          that the goal of developing scientists and engineers with                       interdisciplinary expertise in biology, microbial genetics,                     biochemistry, biochemical engineering and computer science will be              realized at both institutions.",
