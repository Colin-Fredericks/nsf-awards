 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide opportunities for 30            teachers in the state of Michigan to become knowledgeable about the             Middle Grades Math Project (MGMP) and its attendant instructional model         and to subsequently serve as leaders in mathematics education in their          school districts.  Sixty peers of the 30 leader teachers will also have         the opportunity to learn more about the materials and model in a summer         workshop in 1987.  Both the leader teachers and the peer group will have        follow-up support from the Aquinas College staff and from administrators        and supervisors in their own school districts.  All participants,               especially the leader teachers, will be encouraged to develop additional        instructional materials consistent with those developed by the MGMP.                                                                                            The leader teachers will be recruited for the program by Aquinas College        staff in cooperation with district administrators who recognize their           instructional skills, desire for improvement, and leadership potential.         The leader teachers will be actively involved in the identification of          the peer teachers in the second year.  The leader teachers will also be         responsible for conducting in-service programs in their school districts        in addition to implementing the MGMP units and instructional methodology        in their own classrooms.                                                                                                                                        The project will have direct support from the developers of the MGMP            materials and will allow immediate use and evaluation of those materials        in a summer school of middle grade students.  A well-developed                  evaluation model will allow measurement of the impact of the program on         both the teachers and their students.",
