 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring about changes in instructional practices in             secondary science classrooms in the area surrounding Utah State                 University.  Teachers will be supplied with materials and taught the            techniques necessary to implement the Learning Cycle approach to                instruction.                                                                                                                                                    The program will include three phases.  Phase I will consist of the             preparation of appropriate teaching materials and will be conducted             during the 1985-86 academic year.                                                                                                                               Phase II will be a three-week summer session, for 30 participants who           will receive instruction in cognitive psychology with emphasis on the           Learning Cycle Model.  Activities during the following academic year            will apply the principals and activities in the classroom environment.          Videotaping will allow the participants and staff to document changes           which occur in the classroom.                                                                                                                                   Phase III will consist of a summer workshop for ten of the participants,        to revise the previous program.  During the following academic year, the        revised programs will be used in the classroom and reevaluated.",
