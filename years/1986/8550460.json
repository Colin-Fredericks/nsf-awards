 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop innovative instructional materials for an             activity centered mathematics curriculum for grades K-6.  In this               curriculum, the textbook is replaced by direct and active student               experiences with manipulative materials, accompanied by verbally                presented problems and situations.  Learning is reinforced through the          use of worksheets.  Children work individually on some tasks and in             small groups on others. The sequence of concept development in this             curriculum differs significantly from the standard sequence.  For               example, the concept of fraction is introduced in kindergarten, as is           geometry.  Place value development begins in grade one.  Logic is               introduced in grade two, and the concept of function is introduced in           grade four.  In general, more time than usual is spent on concept               development.                                                                                                                                                    Preliminary materials for grades K-4 have already been developed with           support from the Minnesota Council on Quality Education. Associated             workshops for teachers have been funded by both NSF and the Department          of Education.  The preliminary materials have been used successfully in         a variety of locations.  It appears that they are particularly                  successful when used with Native American children.  This grant will            support the revision of the materials for grades K-4, in preparation for        wider dissemination, and it will support the development of similar             materials for use in grades five and six.",
