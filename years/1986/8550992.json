For each of the two years, 35 teachers of grades 9-12 will enroll in a          12-credit program that will be taught by a team of mathematicians and           mathematics educators who will integrate the mathematics content and            teaching methodology into the program.                                                                                                                          Participants will be expected to implement TIME materials and ideas in          their classes and to share project materials and ideas with their               colleagues.  Participants will be selected from the New York                    Metropolitan area.                                                                                                                                              A handbook will be produced that includes course outlines, course notes,        approaches, techniques, bibliographies, and other materials suitable for        use by college-school cooperative programs throughout the United States.",
