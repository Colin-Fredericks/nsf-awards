 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the mathematical problems of stochastic         control theory and multiple scattering of waves in random media.  It is         a product of joint efforts of two known specialists in this area,               Professors Chow and Menaldi.  The main research effort will be invested         in the study of various theoretical issues in the stochastic control            problems.  It is assumed that dynamical process is subject to influence         of random signals.  The goal is to determine a control function that            optimizes a certain objective, expressed as a function on process               trajectories.  The control is supposed to have an impulse character.            This is an idealized version of a physical situation where one can              observe abrupt changes inprocess trajectories, which can be thought of          as discontinuities, or jumps.  Fo example, the inventory stocks in a            warehouse may be represented in this way, as they experience a jump in          the value at the delivery of new stock.  The control of an impulse              nature is usually represented mathematically by Dirac distributions.            The timings and masses of such impulses are the control parameters that         one wants to select in an optimal fashion.",
