Three damaged and three selected buildings            with light damage will be used to calibrate methods for analysis (at            various levels of sophistication) and for structural-detail                     requirements.  The methods are evaluated in terms of the vulnerability          of the damaged buildings, as well as the safety of the buildings that           were not damaged.  Hardware and software to store, retrieve, and                disseminate large amounts of text, numerical data, and drawings are             designed.  The studies are conducted in cooperation with the Chilean            investigators to produce methods of analysis and detail requirements            for construction in zones of moderate, as well as high seismicity.",
