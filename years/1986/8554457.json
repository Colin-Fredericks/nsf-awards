 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes two three-week workshops for 30 teachers each to        be held during the summer of 1986.  Teachers from Iowa and throughout           the upper midwest who are minimally prepared to teach high school               physics, but who are scheduled to do so, will be selected.  The                 workshops will provide teachers with content background in physics as           well as training in teaching strategies. Resource and instructional             strategies materials created and field tested by the Iowa Physics Task          Force for high school physics teachers will be used. Master teachers            from Iowa will assist in the workshops, aiding participants with subject        matter as well as classroom techniques.                                                                                                                         A very interesting set of follow-up activities should insure the                implementation of an improved teaching/learning environment in the              physics classes of these teachers.  Conference calls on a regular basis         will maintain a close relationship among the participants and the               project staff. Videotaping of physics lessons will be carried out every         nine weeks by participants.  These tapes will be critiqued by project           staff and returned with comments and suggestions.  On-site visits will          be conducted by project staff to personally observe the classes.",
