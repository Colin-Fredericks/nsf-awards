 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to assemble the essential components of a           versatile laser spectrometer to enable students of physical chemistry to        carry out experiments in Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved absorption           spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.  The total           system includes both a pulsed Nd:YAG laser and a dye laser, as well as a        monochromator, a signal processor, and a laboratory computer to store           and analyze the data.  The spectrometer will be used to introduce               students to several phenomena and techniques which are important to             current research in chemistry.  These include (a) principles and                applications of lasers, (b) techniques for measuring very fast                  processes, (c) manipulation of a sophisticated optical-electronic               system, and (d) computer interfacing and control of experiments.  This          system will also provide an opportunity for chemistry majors to use             state-of-the art laser equipment for independent research projects.  An         important outcome of this project will be the eventual publication of a         variety of well-tested, documented experiments for undergraduates using         state-of-the-art laser systems.  Thus this project can serve as a               national model, and contribute to the improvement of chemistry education        on the national level.",
