 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental study of dynamical instabilities in laminar premixed            flames is conducted.  The results are to be compared with recent                predictions of theoretical combustion science and nonlinear dynamics.           Most of the research is to be conducted on low-pressure,                        hydrocarbon-air flames on a porous plug burner.  Prior experimental             studies of low-pressure, burner-stabilized hydrocarbon flames have              identified four nonsteady modes of propagation:  an axial made in which         the flame front moves perpendicular to the burner; a radial mode in             which the flame front periodically changes its spatial extent on the            burner; a spiral mode in which the flame front assumes a nonplanar              shape, such as a saddle.  Even the most complicated motion of the flame         front is described by only a few modes.  The observations are similar           to predictions for flames freely propagating in channels.  This                 experimental study is to determine the spatial and temporal                     characteristics of these modes as a function of the external                    parameters.  In addition, several studies are to be conducted which             examine combustion phenomena from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics         and the theory of chaotic systems.",
