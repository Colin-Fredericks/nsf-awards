 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry education of undergraduate students at Notre Dame College         of Ohio will be enhanced by laboratory experience with a state-of-the-          art Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer.  This instrument will         allow students in Organic Chemistry to follow reaction progress and             identify reaction products; in Spectrometric Methods, to analyze \"real-         world\" mixtures; in Physical Chemistry, to define molecular structure           and thermodynamic properties; in Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, to               observe metal-ligand interaction and bonding.                                                                                                                   Using a computer to interface with other laboratory instrumentation, the        students will develop facility with computer control of instrumentation         and computerized data acquisition and analysis.  In particular, students        in Electronic Instrumentation and Analytical Methods courses will learn         to apply modern computer technology to the chemistry laboratory.                                                                                                This women's college makes special efforts to encourage and enhance the         chemistry education of women undergraduates, including minorities and           handicapped students.  Through this project, the college will continue          its contribution to the education of women scientists.  Its chemistry           students will develop expertise in using modern laboratory                      instrumentation and computers to solve chemical problems, and will              capture the excitement and vision of modern chemistry.",
