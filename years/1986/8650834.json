The instruments include an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, a gas           chromatograph, and a UV/visible spectrophotometer with appropriate              computer interfacing to provide instrument control and data analysis and        reporting.  The project is providing a stimulating, advanced learning           environment in which students study environmental pollution and methods         of control.  Ten environmental courses are being improved, a new                advanced environmental monitoring and analysis course is being                  developed, and a laboratory manual will be written and published.               Significant improvements in undergraduate instruction in environmental          science are being implemented, and scientists better able to solve the          Nation's complex environmental problems are being educated.",
