 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deliver in-service training to teachers of geography.         Thirty teachers, grades 6-10, will be selected from Minnesota and               Western Wisconsin.                                                                                                                                              During the program the participants will take two graduate courses,             Advanced Regional Geography and Curriculum Development Workshop.  Each          participant will produce six modules for use in world-regional and North        American geography courses.                                                                                                                                     Preference for admission into the program will be given to teams made up        of both elementary and secondary school teachers.  Such teams will be           expected to be involved in improving geographic education at all levels         in their district's curriculum.                                                                                                                                 The participants will attend a three-week Workshop during the summer of         1986 and our all-day follow-up sessions during the academic year.                                                                                               In addition to the main components of the program, co-curricular                activities will be arranged so that the participants can meet their             peers from Japan who will be at Macalester attending an institute for           teachers of English.",
