 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minnesota Mathematics Mobilization is a statewide effort to broaden             communication among mathematics teachers, leaders in research and               industry, and governmental officials about issues concerning precollege         mathematics education.  It is intended to increase support for                  mathematics education in the state, to provide a statewide forum for            discussion of mathematics education, and to provide a link between              Minnesota mathematics education efforts and related national projects.          The Mobilization will integrate resources into an effective human system        of experts, making existing knowledge available to anyone who has need          of it.                                                                                                                                                          Specifically, the Mobilization will undertake the following activities:                                                                                         1.Establish a statewide newsletter containing information on math               education in Minnesota.                                                         2.Hold several statewide meetings each year.                                    3.Establish a centralized statewide information resource (e.g., an \"800\"        telephone number) to put teachers in touch with persons who could help          with mathematical concerns.                                                     4.Identify and support resource individuals in mathematics and                  mathematics education who are willing to provide help to others.                5.Provide public information, position papers, and expert testimony to          inform diverse audiences about mathematics education.                           6.Promote the growth of speaker bureaus, monitored by regional                  contact persons in various sectors of the state.",
