 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exploratory research on active structures will be initiated.  An active         structure is defined to be one consisting of two types of                       load-resisting members:  the static or passive members and dynamic or           active members.  Their integration produces a structure which is                adaptive to changing environmental loads and changing usages.  The              importance of undertaking this research rests on the belief that active         structures represent truly optimal structures.  Furthermore, they have          the best potential of meeting increasingly stringent safety and                 performance requirements.  The research planned for the first year will         be devoted to establishing a foundation for structural optimization             involving active member characteristics and time-varying configuration.         It is envisioned that active structures will be fundamentally different         from traditional structures in all aspects:  geometry, topology, and            material utilization.",
