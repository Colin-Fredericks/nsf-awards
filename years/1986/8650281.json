 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to equip the laboratory for a new, required         course in Cellular and Molecular Biology.  This course has been moved to        the college's unique Spring Short Term to allow improvement and                 expansion of the laboratory experience afforded the students.  (During          this Spring Term, Bates students immerse themselves in a single course.         This scheduling permits longer, more open-ended laboratory experiences          than are possible to fit into the normal laboratory period of three or          four hours.) The new equipment also will allow more individualized              student instruction in such basic techniques as cell fractionation,             electrophoresis, column chromatography, enzymology, and cell culturing.         The improvements made through this award are expected to strengthen             significantly the technical skills of students in this course, and to           have a major secondary effect on the advanced laboratory electives              currently taught in the Department. Instruments procured through the            award include ultracentrifuges, a 12-port filtering manifold, tissue            culture and cell harvesting apparati, electrophoresis equipment,                fraction collectors and other chromatography instruments.",
