 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of digital spectral data obtained by satellite and air-            borne scanners is being used to improve undergraduate education in earth        science at Whittier College.  Recent technological improvements now             permit image processing using personal computers so that the digital            data can be processed and displayed on a television screen without the          need for large computing facilities.  The digital images thus generated         resemble aerial photographs of very large areas and are of interest to          earth scientists, land managers, policy makers, social scientists, and          others.  The system is being used as a flexible tool which allows               students to manipulate the data to suit their particular interests.  A          new course in the applications of remote sensing has been developed,            aimed at science and non-science majors, and modifications have been            made in the laboratory work of six lower- and upper-division courses.           Through these several improvements and new initiatives, students are            being introduced to one of the most recent techniques of data                   acquisition and analysis, thus faciliting their appreciation of regional        relationships, of the importance of spatial and space-time perceptions,         and of the connections between geology and other disciplines.",
