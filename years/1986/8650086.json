The program will consist of lectures, discussions, and laboratory work,         as well as field trips to a petroleum facility, a geothermal steam              field, a regional sewage and water purification plant, an air and water         quality testing facility, an agricultural experimental station, and a           recycling plant.                                                                                                                                                The workshop during the first summer will recruit 30 secondary teachers         of biology from the San Francisco Bay area.  During the second summer,          30 secondary life and physical science teachers will be eligible to             attend. During the third summer secondary Mentor Teachers from                  throughout Central California will be invited to attend.                                                                                                        The activities during the subsequent academic year will consist of three        one-day workshops and visits to the classrooms of the individual                participants.                                                                                                                                                   In addition to the content material and the support provided by the             university faculty and mentor teachers, appropriate curriculum materials        will be developed.",
