 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project for MS/JHS teachers involves the             collaborative efforts of eight electrical utility companies, the                National Science Teachers Association, and the National Science                 Foundation.  It will provide a two-week summer workshop for 80 middle           school/junior high school teachers at 8 regional centers serviced by the        participating electrical utility companies (10 teachers/site),                  geographically distributed throughout the U.S.  A regional committee of         science educators will select the participants based upon a formal              application and commitment of supervisory personnel in applicant school         districts to support participants in follow-up efforts of curriculum            implementation and in-service activities.  In the proposed second year          of the project the numbers of teachers will increase to 120 distributed         among 12 regional centers serviced by electrical utility companies.                                                                                             Workshops will be staffed by appropriate utility company staff, local           college and university professors, and environmentalists. A master              teacher will be retained at each site to assist participants in                 developing classroom activities and appropriate in-service programs.            Follow-up support will be available to participants from the workshop           staffs.                                                                                                                                                         The overall goals of the project focus on increasing the knowledge of           the participating teachers in the areas of the science and technology           involved in electrical energy production, including the societal,               economic and environmental impacts of that production; the translation          of that knowledge into appropriate activities for middle and junior high        school classrooms; and the communication of that knowledge to colleagues        of participants in their schools through in-servics activities.                                                                                                 The classroom activities developed will be piloted in classrooms,               revised, edited and published so that all participants will share in the        benefits of the collective efforts.  National energy education resource         guides and curriculum efforts will also be made available to the                participating teachers.",
