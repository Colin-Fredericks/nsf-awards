 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will explore a number of factors concerning the           children's television series \"3-2-1 Contact\" including: (1) awareness of        the series on the part of children, parents, and teachers;                      (2) perceptions of appeal and comprehensibility of the program format           among both viewers and non-viewers; (3) the demographics and viewing            habits of viewers and teacher users; (4) reasons for particular modes of        viewing and use; and (5) impacts that result from viewing.  A major goal        of this exploratory study is to identify factors that require more              detailed, controlled research before their influence can be fully               understood and that offer promise of productive research because their          influence is clearly significant.                                                                                                                               The study will focus on 100 children in the 8-12 year age range (the            target audience), 100 viewers in the 4-7 year age, 100 parents of               viewers, and 150 teachers of grades 3-6.  Two-hour group sessions will          provide study subjects with opportunities to respond to questions on            series awareness, modes of viewing and using the series, and series             impact.  Subjects will complete written questionnaires, view selected           program segments from the series, and then participate in oral                  interviews.                                                                                                                                                     The expected outcomes of the study are: (1) a description of the viewing        audience; (2) an understanding of patterns of series viewing at home and        use in the schools; (3) the role of parents and teachers in stimulating         children to view the series; (4) a picture of audience response to              program formats and performers; and (5) a measure of program                    comprehensibility among different types of viewers.  The final outcome          will be a comprehensive research model for additional study of \"3-2-1           Contact\" as a vehicle for science education.",
