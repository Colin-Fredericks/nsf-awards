Four Grass polygraph              systems, ten microscopes, and an Apple IIe-based instrumental control           and data collection system are being installed in the undergraduate             Animal Anatomy and Physiology laboratories to potentiate a basic and            far-reaching curricular change.  Six laboratory courses are affected.           Majors in Animal Science now will graduate from this program much better        prepared to meet the demands of graduate school or employment in this           rapidly growing aspect of applied biology.  The project serves students         of mainly urban origin and of diverse backgrounds, ethnicities and              socio-economic levels.  Approximately 70% of the students served are            women.",
