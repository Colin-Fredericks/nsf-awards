 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will incorporate a modern, computer-controlled Fourier             transform infrared spectrometer into the established project-based              Advanced Laboratory program at Westminster College.  This program,              developed over the last fifteen years, has been very successful in the          preparation of students for a wide range of scientific and technical            careers.  The new instrument will replace an aging and failing                  spectrometer whose capabilities are very limited.  This project will            enable students to gain experience with a modern computer-controlled            spectrometer and to use all of the capabilities inherent in its design.         The Advanced Laboratory program and Organic Chemistry laboratory will be        improved by the addition of many new techniques not previously                  available:  computer data handling, spectral database searching,                reflectance sampling methods, and high resolution vibrational-                  rotational spectra for the study of gases.  These capabilities will             allow students to study molecular structures and properties in a variety        of chemical, biological, and environmental samples.  Almost 50% of the          students affected by this project are women preparing for science               teaching, scientific or technical careers.",
