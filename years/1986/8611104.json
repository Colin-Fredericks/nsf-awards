 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research, a new technique (called Dynamic X-Ray Diffraction             (DXRD) will be developed to study reaction kinetics in solid systems.           Ideally, kinetic measurements should be done with techniques that are           non-destructive, have low energy flux requirements, and can be used             continuously or with very rapid repetition times compared to the                half-life of the kinetic process.  There are a number of spectroscopic          techniques that meet these requirements in gaseous or liquid systems,           but they usually work poorly, if at all, in solids.  (An exception are          those methods depending on magnetic properties, but these are limited           to those few systems that show a change in type of magnetism present.)",
