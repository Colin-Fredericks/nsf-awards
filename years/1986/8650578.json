 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide electrical engineering undergraduates with            thorough training in modern communications engineering.  Instruments to         be purchased include apparatus to modulate, transmit, and detect radio-         frequency signals by AM, FM, SSB, and a variety of digital techniques.          They also include counters, oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and noise        generators to aid in the analysis of signals.  Communications                   engineering has been emphasized less than some other fields of                  electrical engineering, yet electronic communication is vital to the            operation of most electronic devices, particularly computers.  Future           communications networks will be required to perform better than existing        systems, and students need to be trained in all major methods of                communication in order to design these networks effectively.",
