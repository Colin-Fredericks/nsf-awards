 "awd_abstract_narration": "The First International Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption was            held in West Germany in May 1983.  The recent research and development          activity in both gas and liquid phase adsorption throughout the world           has been dramatically high.  The first conference was an acknowledged           success and the fact that the second international conference is                planned for the U.S.A. is a tribute to recent achievements by our best          researchers.  Scientists from leading international institutions will           attend.  NSF support will allow the participation of some leading U.S.          academic researchers and a few selected speakers from Europe.  There            will be strong benefits for all active U.S. adsorption researchers from         this meeting.",
