 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the chemistry education of undergraduate              students at the University of Minnesota--Morris by providing laboratory         experience with NMR spectrometry.  The project is aimed primarily at            chemistry majors, but also will serve a large number of students in             other science and preprofessional programs.  A 60-MHz NMR spectrometer          with spin decoupler and variable temperature capability will be used by         students in organic, analytical, and physical chemistry laboratories and        undergraduate research. In laboratory courses, students will study              characteristic NMR phenomena such as chemical shifts, spin-spin                 coupling, spin decoupling, linewidths and relaxation times, and will            discover how these are applied to the elucidation of molecular                  structure, to problems of quantitative analysis, and to the study of            chemical kinetics.  Student researchers will use the instrument in their        projects dealing with chemistry of natural products, including those            with potential medicinal value.",
