 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will introduce high performance liquid chromatography              (HPLC) into the chemistry curriculum of Allegheny College.  A                   significant instrument acquisition program is near completion, and this         project will bring the institution one major step closer to that goal.          This computer-controlled HPLC system is suitable for both accurate              analytical work and mixture separation.  Included are detectors that            indicate the presence and quantities of virtually all common chemical           substances.  The entire operation will be run from a data system that           can simultaneously direct the instrument through the specified analysis         routine and collect the data that result.  It also has the capability to        retrieve and interpret data from previous experiments during the entire         process.                                                                                                                                                        As a primary objective, the HPLC will become an integral part of the            instrumental analysis course.  In addition, student research will be            aimed at the development of better procedures for optimizing analytical         conditions.  Since there was previously no HPLC equipment at the                college, the project will, for the first time, provide the opportunity          for students in chemistry and other departments of the natural sciences         to use this very practical and versatile technique.",
