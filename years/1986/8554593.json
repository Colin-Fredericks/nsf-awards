 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a partnership among San Diego County school districts,          the University of California-San Diego, and industry to improve the             quality of teaching at the middle/junior high school and senior high            school levels.                                                                                                                                                  Year one will address the needs of participants from the middle/junior          high schools.  Year two will address the needs of participants from the         high school. The target population will include teachers of science             courses with background deficiencies in science as well as those with           science backgrounds but who lack sufficient training in teaching                methodology.                                                                                                                                                    Fifty teachers from the San Diego County schools will be selected each          year.                                                                                                                                                           The summer phase will be a six-week program consisting of intensive             subject area seminars, methodology workshops, and some internships in           laboratory setting.                                                                                                                                             School year activities will include the initiation of a hot-line to the         San Diego County Office of Education, follow-up visits to the                   participants' schools, and a monthly colloquium.",
