 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data analysis can provide a powerful and relevant approach to teaching          key mathematical skills to elementary school children.  It provides a           meaningful context for the use of computation skills.  It involves              students directly with important mathematical ideas that are applicable         to science, social science, and problem solving.  It is a vehicle for           bringing real applications of mathematics into the classroom.  It is a          topic that is familiar to teachers.  And calculators and computers              provide tools for collecting and analyzing data in the classroom that           previously have not been available.                                                                                                                             This project will develop recommendations, prototype materials, and             calculator and computer activities to be infused into a new K-6                 curriculum strand on data analysis.  The materials will emphasize age-          appropriate data analysis skills such as counting, comparing,                   classifying, looking for patterns, finding central tendencies and               variation, and predicting trends.                                                                                                                               This project will target a broad range of students, especially those who        have historically been underserved (girls, minorities, and disadvantaged        students).  Project materials will reach approximately 10,000 teachers          through a network that will distribute a newsletter as well as the              student materials.  Videotapes will be produced for use in teacher              education.",
