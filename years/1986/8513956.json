 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with theoretical and experimental studies of                 diffusion and reaction in heteroeneous media.  The effect of                    homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions on the diffusive process in             two-and three-phase systems is considered, as well as an exploration of         the influence of membrane resistance on the process of diffusion and            reaction.  The method of volume-averaging will be used to develop               one-equation and two-equation models of transport in heterogeneous              media.  Expressions for effective transport parameters will be derived          and the constraints associated with the derived equations will be               obtained.  The experimental program includes an investigation of                diffusion in passive and reactive heterogeneous systems and heat                conduction in three-phase systems.  Carbon dioxide transport through            thin films of microcapsular suspension is studied in a diffusion cell           to obtain effective permeabilities.  Diffusion of phenol in double              emulsions in a batch reactor is investigated to obtain effective                diffusivities and effective chemical reaction rate constants.  Finally,         steady state heat conduction in three-phase systems is measured to              obtain effective conductivities.",
