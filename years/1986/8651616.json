 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electronic hand-held calculator is a tool that can be used as an            integral part of the elementary school mathematics curriculum.  With            calculators so abundant and inexpensive, each child should be able to           have a calculator for appropriate use in mathematics and in other               subjects where mathematics can be applied.  Although some materials are         available that support the use of the calculator in the elementary              school, there exists currently no coherent set of materials that looks          at the curriculum in a new light, assuming that the calculator is an            essential tool to be used in learning and doing mathematics.                                                                                                    This project will develop a model for change in the K-6 mathematics             curriculum, based on the assumption that every child has a calculator.          Anticipated changes include diminishing time spent on certain topics            (such as long division) and increasing time spent on other topics (such         as problem solving and reasoning). The project will develop a set of            calculator-based student materials for Grades K-6 designed to be                flexible enough to stand alone or be supplementary; a set of teacher            materials that will include a guide for teaching mathematics using              calculators and student evaluation materials with protocols for                 evaluating student work when engaged in activities such as problem              solving; and materials on the use of calculators in an elementary               setting, to be used in the preservice preparation of teachers.                                                                                                  The project will be a collaborative effort of the California State              University at Fulleraton and the Los Angeles Unified School District.           One of the goals of the project is to create a replicable model for             university-school district cooperation in curriculum development and            teacher education.",
