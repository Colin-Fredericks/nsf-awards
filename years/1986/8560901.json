 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design and fabrication of tooling for net shape forming processes is a          lengthy, complex and expensive undertaking.  Research addresses                 feasibility of producing an expert system for use by product and                process designers in evaluating and selecting production processes.             These processes require detailed understanding and control of several           interacting phenomena:  metal flow, heat transfer, and friction, within         a three dimensional structure--the tooling.  Because of the complexity          of these phenomena the design of the tooling is based in part on rules          in the minds of experts, and impact on analytical models.  The approach         in this project is to embed both types of knowledge in a microcomputer,         in a form usable by small manufacturing firms.",
