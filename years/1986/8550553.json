 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deliver in-service training to 40 secondary teachers          of mathematics, 20 participants attending each of two years.  The               participants will be selected from the greater Philadelphia area.  The          two-year project will provide courses in computer science, instructional        design practicums, a series of workshops, and a series of networking            sessions.                                                                                                                                                       A series of 1/2 day workshops for principals, presidents of the local           parent support group, and teachers will be held prior to the beginning          of the courses.                                                                                                                                                 Three courses in computer science will be taught for each group of              participants.  These courses will be:  (1) A First Course in Computer           Science (2) Structured Programming with Pascal, and (3) Advanced                Programming Concepts.                                                                                                                                           The Instructional Design course will allow the participants the                 opportunity to design and develop learning resources which they will use        in their classrooms.                                                                                                                                            The courses will be offered during the summer and the academic year.                                                                                            During the school year, monthly meetings will be held for the                   participants and those already teaching computer science courses.  The          meetings will provide further instruction and support for those teaching        computer science.",
