 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership project will provide enhancement and professional               development experiences for 150 exemplary mathematics teachers and up to        450 of their peers from the eastern Tennessee area.  The overall goals          of the multiyear project involve the updating and deepening of the              participants' mathematical backgrounds and teaching methodology, the            networking of the 540 participants, the conduct of frequent in-service          helping and sharing sessions by the participants in their schools, the          dissemination of the project materials and results, and the                     investigation of the modelistic approach within a carefully planned             documentation, assessment, and evaluation effort.  The MATHCAPS                 consortium of teachers and administrators of area schools, faculty, and         administrators of colleges and universities, state-level educators and          officials, scientists from a Federal research laboratory, and leaders           from business and industry provides the strategic approach and financial        base for institutionalizing the project.                                                                                                                        In the first phase 30 middle school leader teachers will participate in         an 8-week summer workshop, academic year meetings, and a 5-week summer          workshop.  The 150 peers will visit each summer workshop in order to            build their project involvements.  The mathematical education goals,            contents and methods of the project have been conceptualized through            advice from teachers, supervisors, mathematics teacher educators and            researchers, and evaluation experts.  Selection procedures are thorough,        involving specific commitments of time and effort by leader teachers,           peer teachers, and their principals.  Treatments of major mathematical          curricular areas will be provided through Visiting Scholars selected for        their expertise from research and teaching experience.  Frequent and            meaningful academic year follow-up will be completed by project staff           and all teachers.  Significant materials will be produced, utilized and         refined by the staff and the teachers, including videotape protocols of         outstanding teaching and in-service modules for use by other leader-peer        teams of teachers.  All aspects of the model will be documented and             assessed.",
