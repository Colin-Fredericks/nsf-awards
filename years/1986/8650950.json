 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most fundamental of experimental psychology's foundations is the            quantitative measurement of behavior.  Recent improvements in                   intelligent instrumentation have made systems for quantitative image and        motion analysis commercially available.  The more sophisticated of these        instruments enable rapid high-resolution quantification of multiple             moving objects.  At the same time a host of laboratory problems in              experimental psychology require the accurate quantification of behaviors        that can be measured readily by optical means.  Examples are the                coordinated movement of a limb as it is affected by maturational                changes; the locomotor sequence of test animals as they are affected by         stimulant drugs; the interactive dynamics of children in a preschool            classroom as they are affected by varieties of play activities; the             exact location and volume of brain lesions as they relate to observed           behavioral changes.  A single high-quality quantitative image and motion        analysis instrument is being applied in a wide range of laboratory              problems similar to these.                                                                                                                                      The major objectives are three-fold:  a) immediately enhancing the rigor        of existing lab work in several advanced courses as well as ongoing             student-faculty research projects; b) improving the variety and                 quantitative rigor of laboratory work in the majority of second, third,         and fourth-level laboratory courses; c) developing a library of                 instructional applications, as well as a library of applications                software, for quantitative image analysis. Quantitative image and motion        analysis provides a quantum methodological advance for experimental             psychologists in that it confers the capability to measure unobtrusively        and simultaneously multiple dimensions of the behavior of multiple              organisms.  This project brings a state-of-the-art instrument into              undergraduate laboratories in a way that invigorates a set of upper             division courses.  The novel applications this faculty has designed have        the potential of serving as a model for other high quality undergraduate        psychology programs.",
