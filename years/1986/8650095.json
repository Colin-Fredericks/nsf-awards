 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New England Aquarium will develop an \"inquiry-driven\" gallery for           the study of aquatic sciences in a move to go beyond the \"naming\"               experiences in biology and environmental education.                             The project will focus on seven conceptual themes:  1) adaptation and           evolution; 2) habitat; 3) life cycles; 4) development and metamorphosis;        5) species interactions; 6) energy flow: and 7) signals and senses. The         exhibits will challenge the visitor with questions, puzzles and games.          Curriculum materials will be developed for teachers along with a users          guide for visitors.  Outreach activities are planned, aimed at minority         students and visitors.  The Aquarium serves approximately 155,000               students and over one million visitors every year.                                                                                                              The redesigned gallery will house eight tanks, ranging from a series of         small tanks with accompanying video clips that display seldom seen              behaviors such as the \"birth\" of seahorses, lobster molting, etc. to            three 250-gallon tanks that will display ancient fishes and a variety of        species showing different kinds of locomotion, color and sound.  A 2500-        gallon tank housing a school of fish will demonstrate different ways            terrestrial and aquatic animals sense their surroundings.  A 4000-gallon        floor to ceiling tank will display a salt marsh on one side and a               mangrove forest on the other and a 6000-gallon tank will house large            groupers, moray eels and small gobies.  The NSF award represents                $273,971 out of a project total of $857,986.",
