 "awd_abstract_narration": "The practical and intellectual contributions of genetic technology              (g.t.) range from genetic screening to improved understanding of the            immune response.  The ethical and regulatory implications have raised           considerable debate, and there is strong consensus among scientists,            educators, industry representatives, specialists in bioethics, and              policymakers that public education is necessary for effective                   participation in debates that will confront U.S. citizens about the use         of g.t.                                                                                                                                                         Unfortunately, sound information about the subject has made its way into        the high school biology classroom only haphazardly.  There is little            attention to the basic biological mechanisms involved or to improved            understanding of biological concepts that result from research in g.t.,         nor is there much reasoned analysis of the ethical and legal                    implications.                                                                                                                                                   BSCS, will design, develop, field test, and prepare for commercial              distribution a four-week module in g.t. for use in the general high             school biology curriculum.  The module will be planned and written by           experts in medical and agricultural genetics, bioethics, and high school        biology teaching.  The module will be field tested across the U.S. with         a minimum of 600 students.",
