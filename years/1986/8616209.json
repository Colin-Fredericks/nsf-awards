The purpose is to obtain a consensus for actions that must be            taken in engineering programs to maintain US technological leadership           and a literacy and knowlege level compatible with a college education           in engineering.  Three major issues committees have met to analyze              current studies and reports that impact on engineering education to             obtain recommendations for action items to present to the congress in           November.  The three major issues are:  (1) faculty; (2) curriculum;            and (3) laboratories, computers, and educational technology.  The               actions items determined by the three committees, together with those           of the congress, are incorporated into accreditation criteria wherever          appropriate.  Other items are referred to the appropriate implementing          authorities for consideration.  The objective is to bring engineering           education to a level which not only serves the needs of the profession,         but also provides the necessary overall education desired for college           graduates.",
