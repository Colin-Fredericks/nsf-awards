 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Peninsula Nature and Science Center (PNSC) in Newport News,                 Virginia, has been serving the informal science education needs of the          Virginia Peninsula region for the past 17 years.  As a \"living museum\"          it is a combination of a natural history museum, zoological and                 botanical garden, nature center, aquaria and science center.  By means          of living plants and animals, the PNSC plans to develop a series of             comprehensive indoor and outdoor exhibitions explaining, interpreting           and providing participatory experiences for visitors about the Atlantic         Coastal Plain area.                                                                                                                                             The Commonwealth of Virginia has allocated a million dollars toward             construction of the proposed facility expansion and the PNSC has raised         an additional $502,560 for facilities and exhibits.  The National               Science Foundation grant will provide funds for the indoor exhibits             which include:  \"A Walk in the Past,\" covering the geology of the area,         a time line wall with touch specimens, the earth's formation and the            Dismal Swamp; \"How Life Survives,\" covering food gathering, protection,         shelter and living space and propagation along with a microscope                station; and the \"World of Darkness,\" where activities of nocturnal             animals can be observed.                                                                                                                                        The PNSC has an extensive teaching program with the elementary schools          in the region.  They plan to expand these activities and, additionally,         expect to have a statewide impact since they will be a prime informal           science education resource in the state.  They also have the potential          of becoming a model for the 1600 nature and science centers in the U.S.",
