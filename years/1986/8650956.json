 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of biochemistry has advanced significantly in the last decade.        Much of the progress is directly attributable to the development of             techniques with greatly enhanced power of resolution and speed of               analysis. Integration of computer-assisted data collection and data             analysis capability in modern equipment has further revolutionized the          conduct of biochemical experimentation.  The Mount Holyoke faculty              provides a rigorous biochemistry curriculum with heavy emphasis on              laboratory experience -- one that is regularly reviewed and updated.            Thus in the upper-level biochemistry courses, the lecture coverage in           general has kept pace with the rapidly advancing field.  In contrast,           the laboratory exercises, although sound and current in design, had been        poorly implemented due to old instrumentation.  This award provides             funds for major equipment acquisitions needed to drastically upgrade the        laboratory facility.  The improved facility makes possible the rigorous         probing of experimental questions by modern means of analysis.                  Furthermore, the use of computer-enhanced analytical capability is being        emphasized.  The College enjoys an enviable record for producing women          scientists -- a record that should be further enhanced through this             project.",
