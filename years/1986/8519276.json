 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic mechanism by which anionic and nonionic surface-active agents         such as Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and ethoxylated alcohols remove           oily soils during low-temperature processes is investigated.                    Videomicroscopy studies at Rice using a recently developed experimental         technique will reveal the nature of the dynamic behavior which takes            place when a detergent solution contacts oil under various conditions.          Experiments at Shell Development Company using radioactive tracers will         determine the degree of soil removal from small samples of fabric for           the same detergents and oils and for the same conditions of                     temperatures, water hardness, and pH.  A variety of pure surface-active         compounds are used in these experiments including mixtures of                   negatively charged and uncharged detergents and oils and fatty                  compounds of the types found in typical laundry soils.  Diffusion path          theory will be used to provide a fundamental understanding of the               results in terms of the equilibrium phase behavior of the various               systems.  A key objective is to be able to predict when various types           of microemulsions or liquid crystals form between the original                  detergent solution and oil and when spontaneous emulsification and              related interfacial instabilites occur during the solubilization                process.",
