 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will support the attendance of 20 physics educators (6-8            college and university physicists and 12-14 high school physics                 teachers) at the International Conference on Trends in Physics                  Education, to be held in Tokyo, Japan, August 24-29, 1986.  The                 conference will primarily be concerned with:  (1) problems of classroom         implementation of the results of recent research in physics education,          (2) the impact of technology on physics teaching, and (3) the problem of        motivating students to the study of physics.  These problems will be            considered at both the secondary school and the introductory                    undergraduate levels.  The Conference is the first of its kind in the           Far East, and a large fraction of the participants are expected to be           physics teachers at the high school level.                                                                                                                      The intent of the project is for U.S. Physics educators to share ideas          and gain new insights about physics teaching from International                 colleagues. These insights will be disseminated to other physics                educators in the U.S., especially those involved with curriculum                development.                                                                                                                                                    Participants will be required to develop specific reports based upon            their involvement at the International Conference.  A major topic of            concern will be assigned to each participant as a primary theme for the         report.  Topics will be under two major categories:  (1) How is modern          physics integrated into the curriculum in other countries?  (2) How have        other countries designed teacher support and intervention programs?  The        participants will reassemble in Jaunary 1987, in San Francisco to               present these reports at the annual joint meeting of the American               Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers               (AAPT).  Specific reports will be made to Physics Teaching Resource             Agents, and to the Modern Physics Curriculum Improvement Group.                                                                                                 Following these sessions, selected participants will be prepared for            working with the same groups in June 1987, to implement ideas for               improvements gleaned from the reports.  The Modern Physics Curriculum           Improvement Group is already developing curriculum materials for physics        teaching in high schools and introductory college courses.  The input           from the International Conference participants is likely to lead to             significant changes based upon specific reports.  Also, the reports will        be published in the AAPT Announcer and in The Physics Teacher.",
