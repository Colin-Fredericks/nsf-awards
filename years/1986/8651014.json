 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Evergreen State College will establish a programming laboratory and         prepare teaching materials specifically designed for the teaching of            computer science.  The laboratory facility will consist of thirty-two           personal computers/terminals connected to the College's central Data            General computer, a video projection terminal for group work, and a line        printer for program listings and handouts.  Faculty have developed              programming and problem solving workshops in computer science,                  mathematics, and software engineering which will make effective use of          this terminal facility.  In laboratory sessions analogous to those used         in the physical sciences and under the direction of faculty, students           will perform experiments designed to reveal the fundamental concepts of         the discipline and to instill in them the methodology necessary for the         successful practitioner.  The laboratory will also be used for extensive        student software development projects as part of Evergreen's year-long          project programs in computer science.  With this laboratory facility,           students will learn problem solving methodology faster, and with a              higher retention rate, than is now the case.  Students will also gain           valuable experience working in programming teams.",
