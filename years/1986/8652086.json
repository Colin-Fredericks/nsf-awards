 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project Hampton University will develop a five-year model               program for the preparation of middle school science teachers.  This            model program will involve the development of one new mathematics               course, three new science courses, and the modification of six existing         science courses in the first three years.  Years four and five will             focus on course evaluation and revision, selection of mentor teachers,          and development of field placement and student teacher experiences.  The        science content requirements being proposed satisfy National Science            Teachers Association recommendations for middle school teachers.                                                                                                In an attempt to recruit minority students into teaching, Hampton               University, which has a predominately black student body, will work             closely with high school science teachers and will mount a powerful             recruitment campaign within its student body.  It is projected that             within five years more than 108 students will be enrolled in the middle         school science teaching program.                                                                                                                                This project represents a cooperative effort among the academic                 departments of science education, biology, chemistry, physics, and              computer science.  Faculty from each department will be involved in             course development and evaluation.  Public schools personnel will also          be involved as members of an advisory committee, as mentor teachers, and        in the planning and implementation of in-school preservice teaching             experiences.",
