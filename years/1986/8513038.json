 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) processing of materials is rapidly emerging           as an innovative technique for the formation of novel protective                coatings and free standing forms.  This method of materials fabrication         enables the rapid-solidification-rate (RST) processing of compounds             (e.g., BN, TiB2), reactive metals (e.g., Zr, Hf, Ta, Ti), and high              temperature metal alloys (e.g., based on Ni, Co, Cr, and Fe) for a wide         range of applications.  Although the plasma processing is expanding             beyond turbine technology, there is very limited information available          as to the relations between VPS processing, microstructure, and                 properties.  The overall goal of this project is to examine VPS with            the intention of optimizing the spray parameters through the evaluation         of the quality of the coating.  A wide range of characterization and            test methods will be employed to gain an understanding of the key               process variables and how their control can be employed to obtain               deposits of high quality.",
