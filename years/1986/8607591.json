 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University at Buffalo, State University of New York will                    establish an Earthquake Engineering Research Center.  The goal of               the Center is to conduct research to substantially improve state-               of-the-art basic knowledge, improve the engineering practice, and               improve implementation of earthquake hazard mitigation practices                in order to minimize the loss of property and human lives and the               disruption of all facets of human activities resulting from                     severe earthquakes.  The major research thrusts are a coordinated               and integrated approach to earthquake engineering research                      centered on structural system and lifeline systems; and an                      emphasis on earthquake hazard mitigation in the area of the                     United STates east of the rocky Mountains.  Research activities                 will be concentrated on ground motions, soil dynamics, system                   response and unserviceability, reliability and risk assessment,                 laboratory and field experiments, innovative computing and expert               systems, codified design related issues, and social and                         educational issues.  The two operational divisions of the Center                are the Research Division and the Education and Technology                      Transfer Division.  Other institutions that will participate in                 the research activities are the City College of New York,                       Columbia University, Cornell University, Lamont-Doherty                         Geological Observatory, Lehigh University, Princeton University,                and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.",
