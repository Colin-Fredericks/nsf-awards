 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some mathematics educators have taken the position that metacognition-          knowledge and beliefs about cognitive activity as well as awareness and         control of that knowledge-is critical to mathematical performance and           that research in mathematical problem solving would benefit from                exploration of this phenomenon.  This project is designed to (1)                investigate the relationship between inservice middle school teachers'          metacognitive activity and mathematical knowledge and their problem-            solving ability, and (2) improve teachers' problem-solving ability              through a problem-solving institute focusing on metacognitive knowledge         and experience in mathematical problem solving.                                                                                                                 Fifteen middle school teachers enrolled in an institute on problem              solving and thinking will be the subjects in the study.  Subjects will          be videotaped solving unfamiliar problems before small groups of their          own students and will be tested for problem-solving performance before          and after the institute. Techniques for recording and analyzing                 metacognitive activity are grounded in the work of Schoenfeld (1983),           and problem-solving performance will be evaluated using a process/              product scale developed by Lucas et al.(1979) and Schultz (1985).",
