 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plantations, the botanical garden and arboretum of Cornell University,          is developing a model program of informal education for elementary (K-5)        school children.  Project LEAP, Learning About Plants, will integrate           the academic  resources of Cornell University and the informal setting          of its botanic gardens with the teaching of mathematics and science in          local elementary schools.                                                                                                                                       The project contains five components: 1) a conceptually-based curriculum        of biology, ecology and agriculture  which will include some components         of SCIS (Science Curriculum Improvement Study) and OBIS (Outdoor Biology        Instructional Strategies); 2) a teacher training workshop to stimulate          curriculum integration and modification; 3) multiple two-year visits            between Plantations and local schools providing children with direct            experience with plants and animals; 4) a quantitative program of                curriculum development and evaluation based on learning theory; and 5) a        plan for dissemination of the structure and instructional contents of           this program. Because children will experience LEAP over a period of            years, the complex and meaningful learning of concepts in science will          be achieved in the earliest years of a child's education.                                                                                                       Because LEAP is being designed to become a model program applicable to          many institutions of informal education, two publications will be               produced: a notebook which describes the overall structure of the               program, and a handbook for teachers which presents the individual              lessons of the curriculum and the theoretical background supporting the         choice of curriculum material.  The notebook will distinguish those             elements of the program peculiar to Cornell and Plantations, and                mechanisms through which the program can be adapted to other                    institutions.                                                                                                                                                   The project is being split-funded by the Instructional Materials                Development and Informal Science Education Programs.",
