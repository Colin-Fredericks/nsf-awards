The goals        of the project are to upgrade the knowledge of basic and applied                chemistry of the teachers, to assist them in effectively utilizing the          microcomputer in teaching chemistry, and in developing 25 microcomputer         lessons which augment their existing chemistry curricula.  These 25             teachers will subsequently provide in-service activities to other               chemistry teachers in their geographic area utilizing the skills and            knowledge attained.                                                                                                                                             The network of 25 chemistry teachers currently exists.  They have been          actively involved in the planning for this project.  The group will meet        for six Saturday sessions during the 1986-87 academic year and for two          weeks during the summer of 1987.  The teachers will be supported by a           science educator, a college computing specialist, a research chemist,           and a 1984 Presidential Awardee in Science (Chemistry).  Follow-up              visits will be made by the staff to the teachers in their schools.  The         activities in which teachers are engaged will range from lectures and           laboratories to interactions with computers.  Active participation is           assured, and there will be frequent referencing of activities to the            high school chemistry curriculum.",
