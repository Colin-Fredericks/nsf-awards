 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology faculty at Kalamazoo College is improving the laboratory            portion of its Molecular Biology course through the introduction of             experiments that employ gel electrophoresis.  The biology curriculum            includes core courses in Populations and Ecosystems, General Zoology,           General Botany, and Cellular Biology, as well as a number of advanced           electives.  One such elective is an upper-level course in Molecular             Biology, which consists of a lecture series based on B. Lewin's textbook        Genes II, a journal club based on readings from the primary literature,         and a laboratory.  The purpose of this project is to improve the                laboratory component of this course.  A new series of experiments will          be introduced based on the lab text Recombinant DNA Techniques:  an             Introduction by Rodriquez and Tait.  These experiments will involve gene        cloning in Escherichia coli, and utilize gel electrophoresis at several         points.  The equipment obtained as part of this project is being used to        monitor cleavage and ligation of DNA molecules, as well as to construct         a restriction endonuclease map of a cloned DNA fragment.  Students              completing these experiments are expected to develop a better                   understanding of the concepts and methods in molecular biology, and to          be prepared to do further work in this area.",
