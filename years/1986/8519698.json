 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reserve osmosis, called hyperfiltration, involves separation of a               liquid, such as water, from the dissolved impurities by use of a                membrane permeable to the pure liquid only.  A high feed pressure is            required to cause the fluid to pass through the membrane.  Many                 variables affect performance of purification system using the                   hyperfiltration phenomenon.  These include impurity rejection behavior,         dynamic rates through the membrane surface, membrane strength, and              structure.  Research has been in progress at Villanova on both the              theoretical and applied aspects of reverse osmosis since 1981 has               established the need for a data base to allow improved system modeling.         There are currently conflicts in the open literature and among active           researchers.  A resolution of these conflicts should do much to lead to         innovation using this technique for new applications and a more                 productive program of research.  This research should lead to improved          prediction models which in turn can do much to guide manufacturers in           the synthesis and production of improved membranes.",
