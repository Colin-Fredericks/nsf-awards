 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an interagency transfer of funds to the Department of Education         to support jointly the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988         (NELS:  88) to be conducted by the National Opinion Research Center.            NELS:  88 is a survey based on the national probability sample of eighth        grade students and teachers.  These same students will also be surveyed         in the 10th and 12th grades and in later years to determine the                 educational effects in middle and secondary schools on their higher             educational and occupational experiences.                                                                                                                       This award will support two aspects of the NELS:  88 survey, as follows:                                                                                        (1)Teacher Survey -- A teacher questionnaire (science and mathematics           teachers) will be used in the base-year survey to gather data about the         students samples, the student body as a whole, the teachers themselves          (their training, career expectations, courses taught, and textbooks             used), and the school's facilities, environment, and policies.                  Approximately 11,000 teachers will be identified to complete the                teacher questionnaire;                                                                                                                                          (2)Math and Science Survey Items -- Two pages of survey items will be           added to the eighth grade student questionnaire to ask about student            attitudes and aspirations toward math and science.  Also, similar items         will be asked of the student's parents.",
