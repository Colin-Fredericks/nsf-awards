 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to acquaint undergraduate chemistry            students with the operation and application of lasers in physical and           analytical chemistry.  Because of their unique properties, lasers have          taken a major role in the instrumentation used for chemical research.           Therefore, it is important that potential chemists become familiar with         this component so that they will be better prepared to begin their              professional careers.  An easy-to-use, cost-effective tunable dye laser         system with a signal measurement system will be used in an advanced             laboratory course and in student research as the basis of a number of           experiments designed to highlight the versatility of this light source.         The availability of the laser will expand the usefulness of several             other instruments already in the department.  The experiments done with         the laser system will be published in the appropriate areas in order to         encourage more extensive use of this instrument at undergraduate                institutions, and to help meet a national need for published experiments        with lasers.  The final result will be better education in the field of         chemical instrumentation.",
