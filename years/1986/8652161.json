 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing the high quality of science education which historically has         been provided by the small liberal arts colleges of this country will           require serious consideration of the problems now being faced by the            administrations, faculties and departments of these institutions. The           National Science Board's recent report on Undergraduate Science and             Engineering Education states that \"Serious problems, especially problems        of quality, have developed during the past decade in the infrastructure         of college-level education in mathematics, engineering, and the                 sciences.\"                                                                                                                                                      This conference focuses on fostering collaboration among institutions as        one method of addressing these problems, capitalizing on the increased          resources and diversity which could be provided through cooperative             programs. The conference will address problems now affecting the                undergraduate science curriculum. Too often these complex problems are          given a simplistic diagnosis and routine prescription: more time, more          equipment, better students. In contrast to that approach, this                  conference will raise questions about undergraduate science education           aimed toward provoking discussions of new cooperative approaches and new        answers. Conference participants will be drawn from 25-30 institutions          representing a broad range of geography, institutional types, etc. An           administrator and a faculty member will comprise a team from each. The          conference will be held in November, 1986 with a schedule beginning on a        Thursday evening with a banquet and keynote address, followed by 1 1/2          days of conference activities. The conference format will invoke three          Sessions:                                                                        Session 1 (The Issues) - A plenary session in which questions                  concerning faculty, physical facilities and curricular strategies will          be raised by a group of panelists with experience in the cooperative            programs conducted by Five Colleges, Inc. This will be followed by small        group sessions led by one or two of the panelists in which agreement on         precise descriptions of the problem in each area will be sought.                 Session 2 (Collaboration) - Demonstrations and discussions of Five             Colleges, Inc. cooperative programs will be the focus - including cross-        registration, faculty exchanges, and joint appointments. This will be           followed by small group discussions led by Five Colleges, Inc. faculty.         Session 3 (Strategies and Solutions) - The workshop discussions of the          previous session will continue in greater depth. The final activity will        involve a plenary session devoted to further discussion of the problems         defined earlier and how cooperation might address them.                                                                                                         In order to reach a wider audience, a conference report will be prepared        for dissemination to colleges around the country.",
