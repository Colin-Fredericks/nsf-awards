 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds upon recent work which identified instructional             strategies and teaching behaviors which affect the retention of both            boys and girls in science courses and careers.  The primary purpose of          this work is to develop an intervention program which will encourage            more girls (as well as boys) to enroll in advanced science and                  mathematics courses and to promote their interest in scientific careers.        To achieve that purpose, five groups will be involved in the                    intervention program: secondary school biology teachers, students,              parents, community and industrial volunteers, and science education             researchers.                                                                                                                                                    The project will proceed through five stages.  A preliminary study will         determine the needs of rural biology students, the utility of various           intervention materials, and the validity and reliability of selected            assessment instruments.  Rural biology teachers will be recruited to            participate.  Next, the selected intervention teachers will participate         in a two-week, intensive workshop, conducted by master teachers, to             develop a prototype intervention packet and to preview and evaluate             commercially available materials.  The fourth phase of the project will         be actual implementation of the intervention programs in rural high             schools.  Finally, the evaluation phase of the project will assess the          effectiveness of the program and develop an intervention packet suitable        for wide and diverse dissemination.",
