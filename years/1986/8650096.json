 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Riverside, is sponsoring a program to             retain current physics teachers who are teaching outside their college          major, in order to improve their classroom presentation.  The program           will provide specific teaching aids, and will review the mathematics            essential to the teaching of physics.                                                                                                                           Twenty-eight high school and junior high school teachers of physics and         physical science will attend a four-week summer workshop.  Participants         will be drawn from the Riverside and San Bernardino County Schools.                                                                                             Weeks one and two of the workshops will cover a number of basic physics         principles and the construction of demonstrations which explain these           principles.  In addition to previous activities, week three will review         the mathematics necessary to the teaching of physics and will                   incorporate computer usage.  Week four will be devoted to the specific          interests and problems of the individual participants.  Teachers will           return to their schools with lecture-demonstration devices designed and         built during the summer.                                                                                                                                        The workshop will be supplemented by a series of guest lectures.  During        the academic year, there will be two one-day workshops in February and          May, where teachers will share their experiences of incorporating the           materials into their classes.",
