 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will allow the revision of an established interdisciplinary         course in computer interfacing to reflect current practice in scientific        and engineering applications.  While the course will continue to stress         concepts fundamental to computer interfacing, increased emphasis will be        given to the flow of information between the computer and devices               responsible for sensing and controlling experiments or processes.  The          use of prepackaged hardware and software components to acquire, process         and display data will be introduced after presentation of the basic             concepts.  The student projects requiring the design and implementation         of an application of interfacing will be continued and expanded to make         use of the equipment.  Ten small portable Tandy model 200 microcomputers        will form the heart of the proposed laboratory workstations.  A single          IBM PC-XT and large hard disk will serve as a host to the individual            workstations.  This system will have enhanced capabilities for                  processing, storing, and displaying data acquired from each of the              smaller microcomputers.  The requested equipment will be used in other          physics, engineering and chemistry courses including senior research in         the spring semester when it is not used in the interfacing course.",
