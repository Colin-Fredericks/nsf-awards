 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of a new course that interfaces           the theory and practice of scanning electron microscopy with a                  traditional \"Light Microscopy and Microtechnique\" course.  Electron             microscopy is a common tool used in industry and postgraduate research,         and yet is rarely presented in an undergraduate curriculum.  The new            course, entitled \"Scientific Methods Using Scanning Electron                    Microscopy\", allows upper-division undergraduates to be exposed to this         state-of-the-art technology.  The course is directed at students from a         variety of disciplines and is cross-listed under the Departments of             Biological Science, Chemistry, Engineering, Geoscience, and Physics.            The scanning electron microscope (SEM) acquired through this award              serves as the focus of the didactic aspects of this project which               include the theory of electron microscopy and ultrastructure                    interpretation.  Other basic skills that are emphasized include data            generation, gathering, analysis, and presentation.                                                                                                              Before students enter the course, each is asked to submit a project             proposal from any field or discipline on any topic--as long as an SEM is        part of the methology used to study the problem.  The first three weeks         of the course are devoted to the theory of electron microscopy, and are         designed to give the student a working knowledge of the instrument.             After a rigorous check-out at the end of week three, the student is             given wide latitude in the pursuit of individual projects.  Weeks four          to the end of the semester are devoted to the interpretation and                presentation of data.  Completed projects must be submitted in the form         of a scientific paper, and also as a 10-minute oral presentation.",
