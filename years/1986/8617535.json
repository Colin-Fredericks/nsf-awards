 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to reformulate the basic principles of selective               protection (removal of faulted elements from the power system in the            shortest possible time with minimum loss of sound equipment) in the             environment of system-wide monitoring and manipulating capability and           full utilization of digital control center.  Although the performance           of a power system network can be improved significantly through the             utilization of system-wide computer-communication technology, such              development has been hampered by the continued usage of pre-computer            age technology by the power industry.  Professor Zaborszky's work will          address on the fundamental issues of selective protection and examine           alternate new technological approaches which will fully utilize today's         capability of computer-communication technology.  If fruitful, the new          approaches would change the course of the entire selective protection           industry which is of substantial size.",
