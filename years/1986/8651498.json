 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to enhance the capabilities of mathematics             teachers from the rural Northwest Educational Region of North Carolina.         Sixty teachers in grades 9-12 will be served through five courses, two          offered each of three summers.  These courses are aimed at helping              teachers work with mathematical concepts, materials, and methods that           begin with what they now know and teach.  The courses will cover                problems in remedial mathematics, computing, problem solving, discrete          mathematics, and concepts of calculus.  In addition to the summer course        work, there will be a one-day follow-up workshop in the fall for summer         participants and a follow-up visit by the faculty to each participant's         classroom in the spring.  The project is specifically designed to               strengthen the backgrounds of mathematics teachers from this geographic         area who are particularly weak and insecure in their content preparation        and teaching.  The project aims to attract these teachers to the program        through videotaped publicity about the courses broadcast throughout the         region.  The project seeks to improve not only the teachers' content            preparation but also their self-esteem and appreciation for teaching.           Project evaluation will focus both on changes in content presentation           and in teachers' attitudes.",
