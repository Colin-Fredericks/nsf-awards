The decision aids and methodological guidelines will cover         (1) methods for identifying combinations of failures that could lead to         high-consequence accidents; (2) methods for estimating the                      probabilities of such accidents (especially when there is no historical         experience upon which to base such estimates); and (3) methods for              estimating the health, safety, and environmental consequences of such           accidents.  Detailed case studies will be used to examine and compare           the strengths and weaknesses of alternative decision aids and                   methodological approaches.",
