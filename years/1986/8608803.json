 "awd_abstract_narration": "To rehabilitiate an existing steel-framed building, it is necessary to          evaluate the strength of the structure in terms of its load-carrying            capabilities.  A further analysis for wind effects is also required to          determine the suitability of the structure in its original condition            and after strengthening, if required.  Current methods of analysis are          inadequate to determine the full capacity of the structural system              because they neglect the effect of the geometrical changes in                   dimensions of the main beams and columns.  This project will                    investigate the significance of nonliner effects of geometry and                material properties in relation to the analysis of two-and                      three-dimensional frame systems.  The design methods to be studies are          the plastic analysis and the limit state methods.  The project will             develop detailed procedures to estimate the influence of geometric              effects on the stiffness and strength of plastically designed frames.           In addition, simplified rules to determine when a second order analysis         is needed will be developed.",
