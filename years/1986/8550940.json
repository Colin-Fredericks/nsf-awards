 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS) will develop a program         over the next two years aimed at teachers and students in grades 3-7.           The project will develop teacher kits and \"hands-on\" exhibits tied to           the new state curriculum and to the science television series \"3-2-1            Contact\".                                                                                                                                                       The MMNS is a division of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife                Conservation and is designated as the official natural science museum by        the State Legislature.  The Museum has been in operation for 50 years           and, since its inception, has served as a resource for classroom                teachers. Mississippi has approximately 500,000 public school students          attending about 1,000 schools.  One third of these children are                 considered to live below the poverty level and 50 percent are from              minority groups--a priority for the NSF.                                                                                                                        The MMNS has had success with a small pilot project which coordinates           science concepts taught in the television series \"3-2-1 Contact\" with           exhibit programs at the Museum.  Over the next two years MMNS will              expand their \"hands-on\" exhibits and develop science kits for use in the        classroom in coordination with the new state curriculum and the                 television series. The kits will include museum objects, suggested              activities and a teacher's guide.  During the first year a series of            \"Contact Days\" will be held with teachers and students across the state         to develop and test the effectiveness of the project along with a               lecture program by minority and women scientists.  During the second            year the exhibits will travel to schools across the state.",
