 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much design knowledge is expressed and communicated in graphical form,          and yet no practical method exists for automatically extracting this            knowledge for use within computer-aided design systems.  In addition,           no methods exist for automatically comparing graphical designs for              their similarities and differences.  A framework in which these two             issues (graphical knowledge extraction and comparison) can be addressed         is created.  One approach to extraction of graphical knowledge is the           creation of an expert system which can employ not only facts and rules          but can also reason about spatial patterns.  The theoretical framework          for such a prototypical design tool will be created.  Once developed,           this framework will be useful for all areas of design in which                  knowledge is expressed graphically.  The working system that will be            created under this grant will be a computer-aided architectural design          (CAAD) system.  Once the framework for extracting graphical knowledge           from a drawing exists, the principal investigator will create an expert         system for CAAD that will acquire graphical knowledge from a design             data base.  From a large set of designs, the expert system will make            inferences about the characteristics of these designs.",
