 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing number of scientific laboratories rely on microcomputers          for data acquisition and manipulation, and as terminals to interact with        other computers.  Properly trained students should be familiar with the         use of these computers, the means by which they are interfaced with             laboratory instruments, and their advantages and limitations as compared        to more traditional means of data acquisition.  They also should be             familiar with the techniques by which, for relatively simple phenomena,         microcomputers may be used to construct simulations and models.                                                                                                 Through the purchase of microcomputers and the appropriate accessories,         physiology students at the College of the Holy Cross will become                thoroughly familiar with the techniques required to use a microcomputer         to collect and analyze data directly from common laboratory instruments         and also to use the computers as digital oscilloscopes.  In addition,           simulations and models will be included as adjuncts to most labs.               Besides improving the students' abilities to visualize biological               processes, these models will be used to develop testable predictions as         to how biological processes should occur if they are largely the result         of underlying mathematical, physical and chemical laws.  Through this           project students will have opportunity to develop a thorough                    appreciation for the power of the computer in modern laboratories.  In          addition to their major application in the Physiology labs, the                 computers will be used for modeling in General Ecology and Genetics             laboratories.",
