An action plan will be developed by each school community          and will include the following features: a) designation of the school           principal as the facilitator of school community change, b) selection of        a science instructional leader who will receive special preparation in a        science, technology, society, and science education academy, c) design          of vehicles for the sharing of up-to-date science and technology                information by the science instructional leader with other teachers and         children, d) development of interdisciplinary, instructional thematic           units which provide up-to-date technology learning experiences to               supplement the existing science and social studies programs, and e)             involvement of community businesses, industries, informal education             agencies and key parents.
