Seventy-two selected elementary teachers will participate in a four-week        workshop with an academic year follow-up.  The second year of the               project will extend to teachers from other districts.                                                                                                           The workshop will emphasize the materials, procedures, and methods of           the hands-on program, Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIIS), which has           been purchased by the two districts.  Another major focus of the project        will be to establish model schools of elementary science instruction for        use with undergraduate and graduate teacher preparation programs and for        visitations from other school districts.",
