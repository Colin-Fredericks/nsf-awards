 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instruments to be provided through this project, Nikon Alphaphot-KT         microscopes with phase contrast optics, will permit great flexibility in        illumination techniques and usable magnification powers.  Phase                 microscopy increases contrast in materials with little natural contrast         and is useful in showing cytoplasmic organelles in living or fresh-             unstained tissues.  These microscopes also offer darkfield illumination,        a technique especially valuable in the study of single-celled organisms.        Polarized light microscopy will permit analysis of the stratification of        cell walls and the location of crystals present in tissues.  Further,           the increased clarity, brightness, and resolution of these microscopes          will enhance ordinary brightfield microscopy in the instruction of plant        morphology.                                                                                                                                                     This improvement in optical microscopy, through the updating of                 scientific instrumentation, is expected to have an immediate impact on          the development of structural botany classes at the University of               Richmond, and to provide long-term curricular enhancement that will             enable students to be better prepared to enter graduate or professional         schools.  This project addresses a subspecialty of biology that has             suffered from neglect in undergraduate education.",
