HPLC will introduce                students to time-efficient steps in the separation and detection of             specific cellular components used in microbial identification.                  Applications of HPLC in microbiology will be presented in laboratory            exercises in different upper-division elective courses offered by the           Microbiology Department.  ELISA instrumentation will introduce third-           year students in the required course of Immunology and Serology to              automated, time-efficient steps in the quantitation of specific proteins        on the microbial cell surface using the specificity of antibody-                dependent immunoassays.  Students will become familiar with the                 application of computers to microbiological instrumentation and data            analysis.                                                                                                                                                       Experience with this equipment in the teaching laboratory exercises will        prepare B.S. candidates in microbiology for positions in commercial             laboratories where these techniques are currently in use.  This new             instrumentation will produce a major updating of this B.S.-level                technician preparatory program.",
