 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this project is to establish a model program for the              integration of advanced technology in a preparatory biology course for          preservice elementary teachers.  The program seeks to improve the basic         biology instruction provided to preservice elementary teachers, provide         examples of the use of a variety of advanced technologies in elementary         science teaching, and to involve preservice elementary teachers in the          development and use of computer-based teaching materials for elementary         science instruction.                                                                                                                                            To achieve these goals, a variety of advanced technologies will be              carefully integrated into the curriculum of a two-semester biology              course serving about 200 preservice elementary teachers at Purdue               University.  Students' knowledge and attitudes will be assessed                 throughout the project by comparing sections receiving technology-              enhanced instruction with those receiving \"normal\" instruction.                                                                                                 This project focuses on issues important to the National Science                Foundation and to Science Education.  It represents a bold step in the          direction of computer integration into content courses and through the          many \"hands-on\" activities, and should result in teacher familiarity            with computers and use of computers in teaching elementary science.",
