 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the scientific education of Hope         College's Biology students by providing the modern scientific                   instrumentation needed to assure the currency and quality of their              laboratory experiences.  In physiology and other biological sciences,           computerized data acquisition and analysis systems are being used more          and more frequently in research and teaching.  Purchase of a                    computerized data aquisition system allows students in Introductory             Biology courses, Human and Vertebrate Physiology courses and the                Independent Research course to have hands-on experience with this modern        instrumentation and to gain an appreciation of the power, speed and             overall usefulness of computerized data acquisition and analysis                systems.  The instrumentation makes possible new experiments in the             teaching laboratories and improves the quantity and quality of the data         gathered both in regular courses and in independent research.",
