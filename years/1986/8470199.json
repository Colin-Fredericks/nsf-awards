 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop materials for beginning               readers (kindergarten to third grade) that will promote children's              knowledge of and interests in areas of science while taking into account        the tentativeness of their reading skills.  Very little material is now         available which meets these particular conditions.  Not only will such          material be of specific interest to many young readers, but it will             enhance the competence of all children for understanding and                    appreciating the range of writing in science that they will encounter in        the later grades.                                                                                                                                               The outcomes of the project will be twofold:  (1) A prototype                   demonstration set of science books for beginning readers and (2) A              project report that documents the development and effectiveness of the          materials and provides guidelines and rationale for their use.                                                                                                  The project grows out of a program of classroom research on interests           and learning styles of beginning readers which was conducted by ETS             staff in collaboration with public school teachers.  Research techniques        developed in these previous studies will be used as a guide to                  constructing texts that have substantial science content yet are                directly accessible to the beginner.  The work of the project will              entail collaboration with teachers, scientists and a writer.",
