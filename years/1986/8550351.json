 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities program will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 24 teachers in the earth,              physical, and biological sciences, who have demonstrated potential              leadership abilities in science education.  The participants will  be           recruited Nation-wide with special efforts to include individuals who           have been selected as presidential scholars or identified as exceptional        science teachers.  Three high-ability geology majors, who have not yet          opted for a science teaching career, will be invited to participate in a        workshop for credit.  It is hoped that this involvement will kindle an          interest in a science teaching career.                                                                                                                          The objectives of this program are to provide formal classroom                  instruction on the evolution of the Cascade volcanoes including magma           genesis and plate tectonics, and to include information about the               economic, social and environmental impacts of the eruptions of Mt. St.          Helens from 1980 to present.  The instructional vehicles will be field          trips, field exercises, laboratory exercises, discussions, computer             simulations and group work. The workshop is scheduled for two weeks             August 4-16, 1986.  Most of the formal workshop instruction will take           place at the University with provision for field trips and field work           taking place on site at Mount St. Helens and other locations.                                                                                                   Follow-up activities will include participants sharing their acquired           knowledge and skills with colleagues and students and expanding the             literacy of the community at large about science.  Project information          and results will be available through commercial and participant-               prepared materials, both photographic and textual.",
