 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Santa Barbara, will develop and implement         classroom curricula, both content and methods of instruction, through           site-based change over a period of three years.  During the first year,         the project will initially involve seven schools from Ventura and Santa         Barbara Counties. This will be expanded to 13 in year two and to a total        of 19 schools in the third year.  Teaching specialists, classroom               teachers who have been selected and trained to act as resource persons          and trainers for their colleagues, will serve for one year on a rotating        basis.                                                                                                                                                          The project provides an opportunity for administrators, parents, the            community and teachers to work together.  It provides training and              ongoing support for a cadre of lead teachers, to develop methods that           assess student understanding. The activities of the Tri-County                  Mathematics Project and the UCLA Partnership have been incorporated in          the project.  Much of the in-school activities will be carried out              during one released day each month and six hours per month of after-            school meetings.",
