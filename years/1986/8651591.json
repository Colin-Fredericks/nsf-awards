 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past nine years have yielded a large research corpus on the                 psychology of physical-science problem solving.  Several research               approaches have developed analyses of problem solving in physical               science, emphasizing such aspects as qualitative conceptions and search         strategies.  It is now appropriate to evaluate what we have learned and         what remains to be done in developing a coherent theoretical approach           that supports physical science education.                                                                                                                       Funds are being provided for a four-part working conference that will           enable major researchers in the area of physics problem solving and             education to address this problem.  The first part will attempt to              confront and coordinate  different research approaches to develop a core        model of problem solving by novices in physics.  The second part will           develop the educational implications of the core model.  The third part         will critique the core model by considering what science educators need         from a theory of problem solving to advance the effectiveness of physics        instruction.  In light of the critique, the fourth part will discuss            methodological and conceptual approaches that would better coordinate           psychological theory and educational practice.                                  The conference is scheduled to meet from July 21-23, 1986.  Working             papers prepared beforehand will be used to focus and initiate                   discussion.  The results of the discussions will be disseminated through        an American Educational Research Association symposium and three papers         for appropriate research and education journals that summarize the              current understanding of novice physical-science problem solving, the           limitations of that understanding for educational purposes, and                 directions for future research.",
