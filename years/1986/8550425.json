 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 35 exemplary secondary school          mathematics teachers from the south-central Pennsylvania area.  The             overall project goals involve the updating and deepening of the                 participants' mathematical backgrounds and teaching methodology, the            networking of the participants, the conduct of in-service workshops by          the participants in their home schools, the dissemination of the project        materials and results to nearby school systems, and the investigation of        the modelistic approach within a well-planned documentation, assessment         and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                                          Participants will be selected through recommendations provided by               educational specialists in the Intermediate Units, which provide                services to 72 school districts.  Participants will study the theory and        practice of mathematical modeling, as well as the teaching of school            mathematics emphasizing mathematical modeling and problem solving during        a 5-week workshop on the Capitol Campus.  In small group sessions they          will work together to apply their new understandings to develop plans           and materials for implementing mathematical modeling into their own             teaching.  Further, they will collaboratively plan for the half-day             workshop each is required to conduct for their school colleagues.               During the Autumn follow-up, they will be observed and assisted by              project staff in their own classrooms. They will conduct the workshop           for peers, attend three half-day symposia on mathematical applications          presented by guest industrial mathematicians, and prepare written               reports of all project activities.  The participants will be recognized         and honored, and they will earn eight graduate credits.",
