 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Colorado Alliance for Science is a consortium of schools, school            districts, businesses, industries, institutions of higher education,            professional societies, research laboratories, state agencies, and              community groups working collaboratively to improve precollege science          education in Colorado.  The Colorado Alliance is seeking to establish a         resource-sharing network in science education aimed toward initiation           and maintenance of high-quality science programs in schools.  The               approach used will involve:                                                                                                                                       -the school principal working with teachers in a school to develop a          high-quality science program in accordance with assessed needs of that          school.                                                                                                                                                           -sponsors from industry and from higher education working with teams          and helping them locate resources and solve problems.                                                                                                           The project will have five phases:  organizations; recruitment and              participant selection; planning and exploration; information-gathering          and resource development; leadership.  New sets of school teams will            proceed through these phases starting at the beginning of each year.            The project will be started in four schools; six new schools will start         the phases in Year II; 11 new schools will join the network and start           the phases in Year III.  By the end of three \"cycles,\" each of the 19           schools in the Weld County created a high-quality science program               uniquely suited to its needs.  Teams that start the project in the first        cycle will be asked to help guide new teams that enter during cycle             teams.",
