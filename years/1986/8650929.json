 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve instruction in the courses          in which the root zone of the plant and the soil's interactions with the        plant are studied.  Students must measure plant growth, soil nutrient           status, and the microclimate in order to understand the influence of the        rhizosphere on plant growth.  The goal of the project is to increase            students' understanding of basic scientific principles involved in soil-        plant relationships.  This understanding will foster conservation of            soil and contribute to efficiency in crop production.  The equipment            purchases through this award are typical of the sophisticated equipment         used in soil and plant analysis laboratories that serve agricultural            producers and research.  Instruments for measuring nutrient content of          the soil and for measuring light penetration through the plant canopy           can be used successfully by undergraduate students, and are the types of        equipment that soil and plant science graduates will use in their               careers.  Student enthusiasm for learning the principles of soil                reactions and plant growth is greatly enhanced when instructional               activity is carried out with \"real world\" equipment rather than with            typical student laboratory equipment.                                                                                                                           High precision instruments such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers,        an infrared thermometer, leaf area meter, radiometer, autotitrator, and         plant growth chambers will contribute directly to the objective of              improving instruction in the courses involving soil-plant relations.            For example, the atomic absorption spectrophotometer will detect                elements in the soil; the growth chambers will permit the establishment         and maintenance of two different climates for plant growth in a                 synchronous time frame; the infrared thermometer will measure plant             temperature differences that indicate wilting stress in plant leaves            before the leaf shows visible symptoms of wilting.  This project brings         a very significant infusion of scientific principles and insights to            this agricultural program.",
