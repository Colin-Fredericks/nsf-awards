 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and install an experimental computer-based            Psychology curriculum designed to increase the depth of understanding of        psychological and statistical concepts through computer-based graphic           demonstrations, simulations, tutorials, and the mathematical modelling          of psychological phenomena.  Preliminary progress has been achieved on a        relatively small scale by individual faculty who, over the years, have          been writing educational software for the use of their own students. Now        the Department feels it is time to make a coordinated effort to tap this        resource by expanding the use of this currently available                       educational software and by encouraging the development of new software.        The primary limitation to implementing such a program in the past has           been the lack of available hardward.  The courses where this program            will have a major impact are the Analysis of Psychological Data,                Research Methods in Psychology, Experimental Psychology, Topics in              General Psychology, and Advanced Research Methods, plus the Independent         Study and Honors Research Programs.                                                                                                                             This computer-based curriculum is expected to make possible dimensions          of academic pursuit that would be unattainable without the thorough             integration of the computer into the day-to-day coverage of course              material.",
