 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potsdam College, a regional state teacher preparation institution,              proposes to develop a model program to prepare middle school teachers in        both science and mathematics.  The program will consist of 36 semester          hours in science, 21 in mathematics, and 24 in professional education           with a two-semester teaching internship.  The programs goals are to             provide teachers with breadth and depth of understanding of science and         mathematics; an understanding of the interrelationships among scientific        and mathematical disciplines; and an appreciation of the relevance of           science and mathematics to society and to the lives and concerns of             middle school students.  Teams of scientists, mathematicians, educators         and master middle school teachers will design the new curriculum.  The          science courses, progressing in sophistication and conceptual depth,            will integrate the fundamental concepts of biology, physics, chemistry          and geology.  Students leaving the program after two years will receive         credit for the introductory year in each science area.  The mathematics         minor, coordinated with the science major, consists of four modified            courses and three new ones.  The new courses will focus on applying             mathematics and the integration of topics from the previous courses.            The computer will be part of all courses; PASCAL will be introduced in          the last mathematics course. The existing professional education courses        will be adapted to the needs of middle school teachers and the two              methods courses will be co-taught by college faculty and a master middle        school teacher.  During the professional or final year of the program,          students will teach two classes during the first semester in classrooms         of the master teachers and carry a full teaching load the second                semester.  The program will be carefully evaluated and its effectiveness        widely shared.",
