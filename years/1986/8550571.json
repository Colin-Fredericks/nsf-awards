 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 25 exemplary secondary school          mathematics teachers from Santa Clara County, California public and             private schools.  The overall goals of the two-year project involve the         updating and deepening of the participants' knowledge of problem solving        and integrated approaches to school mathematics topics and teaching             methodologies, the networking of the participants and university                mathematics faculty, the conduct of follow-up sessions and in-service           workshops by the participants in their home schools, appropriate                recognition for honors teacher participants, and the investigation of           the modelistic approach within a carefully planned documentation,               assessment and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                               Selections of participants will be based upon detailed applications             requiring expressions of teacher and school commitments to implement            project emphases. Working with university mathematicians, the                   participants will complete a 16-day summer workshop and eight monthly,          day-long meetings designed to increase their conceptual understanding           of, and commitments to, integrated treatments of mathematical topics, to        develop strategies and teachng plans for problem-solving applications in        their own curriculum, and to develop materials and techniques for use in        their presentation of in-service workshops. They will earn graduate             academic credits from the University of Santa Clara.  During the                preparation of the in-service workshops which the participants will             design and conduct, the project staff will be available for consultation        and support. Participants will be visited and observed in their                 classrooms and in their workshops with their peers.  Careful                    documentation and analysis of these observations and of teacher reports         will provide a significant basis for a detailed project evaluation.",
