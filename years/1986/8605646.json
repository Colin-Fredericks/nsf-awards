 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the study of adaptive control of sampled-data            systems which contain at least one non-linearity.  The motivation for           the study is to bring the theory of adaptive control closer to the              reality of practical problems.  The method of study proposed is to              combine the small gain theory with the method of averaging in the               environment of equations written in error space.  The method uses the           idea of a tuned system as introduced recently by Kosut.  The class of           sampled-data systems to be studied includes virtually every successful          application of adaptive control known.  Inclusion of some non-linearity         in the plant to be controlled completes the consideration of non-ideal          process already begun in many studies by consideration of un-modelled           dynamics, bounded disturbances and sensor noise.",
