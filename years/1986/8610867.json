 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop optimal earthquake-resistant            design procedures that incorporate the current state of knowledge               regarding the earthquake phenomenon.  Three seismically active regions          are selected for the study.  These include the Mixico subduction zone,          the Alaskan subduction zone, and California interplate boundary regions         (e.g., the San Andreas fault zone).  The following studies are                  performed:  (1) the data for each region is reviewed and analyzed; in           particular, for the temporal and spatial pattern and fault mevhanisms           of large earthquakes; (2) a stochastic non-Poissonian model is                  developed to reflect the temporal and spatial dependence of earthquake          events; (3) the occurrence model is combined with appropriate ground            motion model to obtain sity specific hazard estimates; (4) the                  feasibility of the occurrence and site hazard estimation models is              demonstrated through application to specific sites within the three             study regions; and, (5) optimal design procedures are developed that            consider the non-Poissonian nature of the earthquake occurrences, the           uncertainties in the site ground motion estimation models, and the              benefits, costs, and losses for a particular design.",
