 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project greatly enhances the laboratory experience of undergraduate        biology students at the University of Minnesota at Morris by providing a        microprocessor-controlled luminometer.  Undergraduate students often            need quick, exciting, safe, and successful projects that represent the          state-of-the-art technology in order to first appreciate the rewards of         doing research.  Great improvements are being made in this department's         ability to meet these goals by developing several projects centered             around new technologies involving luminescence detection.  The kinds of         projects involve:                                                                                                                                               a) quantification of bioluminescent phenomena in whole organisms, cell          fractions and biochemical fractions (fireflies, luminescent algae, and          luminescent bacteria are readily available);                                                                                                                    b) quantification of ATP in cell fractions after being exposed to               various conditions (luminescence using firefly luciferase is by far the         most accurate and sensitive method known for measuring ATP);                                                                                                    c) quantification of several enzyme activities by following NADH                concentration in cellular fractions (commercially available bacterial           luciferase can be used as a sensitive method of detecting NADH and              related compounds); and                                                                                                                                         d) detection of antibodies using commercially available luminescent             tags.                                                                                                                                                           The experiments described here are so far superior in cost effectiveness        and safety to the radioisotopic methods usually employed in this context        that the grantee is being urged to publish them for wide dissemination          among college biology faculties.  The approaches supported through this         grant are expected to significantly improve undergraduate biology               laboratories at the University of Minnesota at Morris and potentially to        have value on a national scale.",
