 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to incorporate atomic absorption                     spectrophotometry (AA) into undergraduate science and engineering               curricula at Tri-State University.  An AA system will be used jointly by        chemistry, biology, and engineering programs to improve instrumentation-        based laboratory instruction and to provide students with the                   experimental capabilities afforded by modern instrumentation.  The              equipment will provide analytical capability and training in several            interrelated areas:                                                                                                                                             1. Students in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science,              metallurgy, biology, and toxicology will have experience with AA,               including theory, instrumental design, operation, and analytical                applications.                                                                                                                                                   2. Biology students will use the extended capabilities provided by AA to        analyze heavy metals in tissues and in environmental samples.                                                                                                   3. Student projects and research in water quality in the northeastern           Indiana lakes region will be expanded to include trace element analysis,        thus adding considerably to the scope of information obtained.",
