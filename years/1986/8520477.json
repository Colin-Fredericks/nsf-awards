 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deterioration of masonry structures throughout the country is               becoming a major problem of concern for the general public.  To extend          the life of the building or to upgrade it, economical techniques to             repair and/or strengthen the building are required.  This workshop is a         joint effort between Italian and United States engineers to exchange            ideas, methods, research data, and related experiences on the subject           of evaluation and strengthening of masonry buildings of all types.  The         Italians have had a long history of maintaining masonry structures of           all types and engineers in the United States can benefit from that              experience.  The proceedings produced by the workshop will be very              useful to engineers and architects in the United States because it will         convey the most recent information on the evaluation and strengthening          of masonry structures.",
