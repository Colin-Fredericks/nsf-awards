 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves 32 middle school science and social studies               teachers from the lower midwest.  Working under a team of scientists and        science educators for a period of three collegiate semesters, the               participants will focus on earth science and ecological principles and          on the science-related societal issues associated with geological and           ecological resources in the region.                                                                                                                             One of the strongest components of this project is the outcome related          to the participants' understanding of science-related societal issues           within their own geographical region.  Field activities, supported by           the local school systems, are an integral part of the scheduled                 activities.  Teachers and administrators will be familiarized with the          local and regional resources and will be trained in issue investigation         and problem solving, thus aiding them in implementing similar                   instruction in their own classrooms.  The project will be carried out in        four phases, enabling teachers to participate in activities, carry out          independent investigations, implement these activities in their                 classrooms and evaluate the impact of the project.  Graduate credit will        be given upon completion of the project.",
