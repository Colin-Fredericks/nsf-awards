The goal          of this workshop is the communication of contamination research needs           in private industry to academic and other researchers with the                  capability to develop new approaches.  The association of the workshop          with the Instritute of Environmental Sciences Annual Technical Meeting          to be held at the AMFAC Hotel in Dallas, Texas, May 5-9, 1986, will             foster good attendance.  The IES meeting atracts over 700 professionals         in contamination control and has a large exhibition of instrumentation          and equipment.  The proposed workshop will provide an interdisciplinary         forum to allow focusing of research resources in the next several               years.  Proceedings of the workshop will be widely distributed.",
