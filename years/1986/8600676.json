 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support of the Federal Construction Council (FCC)           during l986.  Work will continue on the development of a conceptual             framework for an integrated computer database encompassing the entire           construction process.  A study of high technology systems for buildings         will identify reliable techniques for evaluating the performance of             high-technology systems at the time of installation and for diagnosing          problems in such systems after they are in operation.  A study of               indoor air quality will assemble and summarize the latest information           on the nature and causes of indoor air pollution and will recommend             interim and/or long-term steps that agencies might take to deal with            the problem.  Finally, a study will be undertaken of criteria for               selecting controls for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning               systems.  Guidelines for selecting controls for HVAC systems in federal         buildings that will help ensure that such systems will operate reliably         and efficiently will be recommended.",
