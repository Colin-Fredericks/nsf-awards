 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a student workbook and teacher's guide that            will enable ninth and tenth grade teachers to incorporate science               fiction films into their teaching of general science.  Begun in 1984            with NSF support, the teacher's guide provides an analysis of science           fiction films with respect to physical principles that are either               illustrated or violated in the films.  The current project will improve         this guide in preparation for publication and will develop accompanying         student materials.                                                                                                                                              The potential use of science fiction films in science classrooms is             enhanced by the availability of many of the films on videotape and by           the wide availability of videocassette players both in the schools and          in homes.  Preliminary evidence suggests that student attitudes toward          science are affected positively by use of the materials and that                students' motivation to continue studying science is increased.",
