 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weber State College is offering a series of three intensive two-week            summer institutes and academic year seminars for 60 elementary teachers         each year from intermountain northern Utah.  The program will provide           broad, comprehensive instruction and activities in life, physical and           earth sciences as they apply to the state of Utah's new guidelines for          elementary school science.  Each participant will have to make a six-           week commitment to insure that all three workshops will be completed.                                                                                           One-on-one follow-up visits by staff to each participant's classroom            will aid in implementing changes in teaching/learning strategies.               Academic year seminars will provide the opportunity for discussion,             support, and evaluation.  Each participant will develop his/her own             resource guide and construct inexpensive equipment for use in the               classroom.  A unique component of this project is the involvement of            preservice elementary school majors who will be interning with                  participants during the summer program.",
