 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray diffraction techniques, both powder and single crystal, are               important components of modern geology, chemistry and physics curricula.        X-ray fluorescence and powder diffraction as analytical tools are               absolutely essential to the field of geology.  The advent of solid state        materials such as semiconductors and thinly coated substrates makes X-          ray analysis an even more integral part of chemistry and physics than it        was in the past.                                                                                                                                                The existing teaching and research X-ray facility at Hope College has           recently been remodeled and refitted to update the powder facility and          to expand the capabilities to include single crystal photographic               techniques. The modernized unit, which is a state-of-the-art teaching           and research facility, is being utilized by students in five geology            courses, two chemistry courses and one course in physics.  The facility         is also being used for undergraduate research activities.",
