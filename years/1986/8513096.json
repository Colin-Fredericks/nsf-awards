 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research develops solutions to understand the influence of three            dimensional effects during dynamic fracture of materials and verifies           the results.  The project develops a novel mathematical approach for            three dimensional elastodynamic crack problems and carries out                  computational work in which numerical solutions will be sought to               understand the fracture process.  The analytical and numerical phases           of the project are closely related and will be carried out in parallel.         A verified three dimensional model is not currently available to                understand the dynamic fracture process of solids.  The lack of such a          development inhibits a complete fundamental understanding of the                various phenomenological features of dynamic fracturing, that are               observed in experimental research and in engineering practice.  A               successful completion of this research would result in major advances           in the development of theory governing the dynamics of crack                    propagation, and would provide realistic descriptions of the fracture           process.",
