 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introduction of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into          biology and chemistry laboratory courses (with a limited introduction           into psychology) is being accomplished through the modular upgrading and        computerization of an existing high performance liquid chromatograph at         Earlham College.  The recent acquisitions of an isocratic pump plus a           gradient solvent delivery system, two detectors (variable wavelength UV         and refractive index), a recorder and a microcomputer-based data                acquisition system and several columns for general purpose and specialty        use allows assembly, with the existing HPLC, of three complete systems          in a variety of configurations for different applications. Students from        the Departments of Chemistry, Biology and Psychology are being exposed          to significantly improved laboratory experiences in an interdisciplinary        mode.  Seven courses are affected, as well as student research in all           three departments.",
