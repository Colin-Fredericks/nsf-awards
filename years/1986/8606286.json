This annual event has been co-sponsored by the American Society          of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)-OMAE Division, National Science                  Foundation, and 20 other international societies or associations.  The          symposia have been successful in promoting offshore mechanics and               arctic engineering and international technology transfer.  This is the          largest technical conference of its kind and brings together technical          experts from around 31 countries.  The organizers have been                     particularly successful in the reseach areas of ice mechanics, fatigue          and fracture control, hudrodynamics, and structural mechanics as                applied to offshore and arctic problems.",
