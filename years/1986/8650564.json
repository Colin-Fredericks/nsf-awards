 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables the Biology faculty at Smith College to enhance its        laboratory teaching of Physiology and Neurobiology by acquiring new,            state-of-the-art instrumentation.  The new equipment includes digital           storage oscilloscopes which can freeze transient data for examination by        students and discussion with their professors; dual channel chart               recorders, controllable by computers, to make hard copies of data for           analysis; microcomputer-based data acquisition systems (updating an             innovative data system originally designed at Smith) to give students in        Neurobiology access to improved techniques for studying the nervous             system; and stimulators and amplifiers, for use in physiological and            neurobiological experiments.  With this improved, modern                        instrumentation, Smith College is continuing its tradition of preparing         women for careers in science.  The project's Principal Investigator is          being encouraged to publish the novel elements of his undertaking so            that other institutions may benefit from them.",
