 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer data collection systems procured through this project are          being used to introduce Middlebury College undergraduate science                students to an important area of contemporary experimental science              previously underrepresented in the school's biology, chemistry, geology         and physics curricula.  These systems permit the teaching of real-time          computer techniques, an area of analytical science whose coverage in            earlier courses was predominantly descriptive.  Students in senior              thesis programs and instrumental analysis courses gain experience with          state-of-the-art computing equipment similar to that which they will            encounter in graduate school or industry.                                                                                                                       In both the course-related studies and independent senior projects, this        equipment enhances students' problem solving skills, and introduces them        to contemporary computer techniques.  A pilot project conducted by the          college with its own funds already has validated the approach, and has          enabled the development of materials and methods.",
