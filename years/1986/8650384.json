The project will use eight workstations, the major                 equipment for which will be: 1) a computer to act as the system host for        all equipment during student experiments, 2) a robot arm and controller,        3) a high speed analog/digital-digital/analog converter used for digital        control and robot interfacing experiments, and 4) a video imaging system        to direct the robot arm and gripper for part orientation.                                                                                                       This laboratory is especially significant because it will prepare               students for electrical engineering applications of robotics and digital        control systems.  Automation using robotics is an important aspect of           future industrial development, and it is important to teach the subject         in an engineering college.",
