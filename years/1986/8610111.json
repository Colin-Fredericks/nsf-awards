 "awd_abstract_narration": "The initial stage of the design process, when a designer first starts           to generate ideas, is not well understood.  Often referred to as                conceptual design, during this stage the designer generates a                   multiplicity of designs and variations on designs, most of which are            never verbalized or formalized.  This phase of design will be                   investigated by studying the knowledge procesess and heuristics that            form its components.  The method will be to present selected mechanical         design problems to experienced designers and to novice designers.  By           analyzing the processes used by experienced and novice designers, the           investigators will determine which of the functional aspects are part           of the inherent knowledge base and which are acquired through training          and experience in design.  The design language and its perceptual               connotations will also be studied.",
