 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10 years, a special radiation training laboratory has been        established and equipped through Used Nuclear Type Equipment grants, NSF        grants, local school support, and industry donations.  St. Mary's               College has become a center of excellence in education in radiation             sciences.  This project fills certain important gaps in the                     instrumentation so that students can be properly prepared to enter the          modern industrial and academic research laboratories.                                                                                                           A Mossbauer Spectroscopy system will allow students to learn the                principles of this important technique which is being used widely to            examine the surface structures of materials, particularly in radioactive        waste disposal.  A new multichannel analyzer will allow superior                analysis and make full use of an existing intrinsic germanium detector.         New sources of radiation will enable students to perform better                 experiments.  Finally, monitoring equipment will enable the department          to ensure that radiation sources are used safely.",
