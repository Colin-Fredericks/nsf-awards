 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to develop computer                        algorithms that can detect and interpret faults in operating                    chemical plants, to be used by plant personnel making operating                 decisions during plant upsets.  Expert systems will be developed                which allow the accumulated experience, judgment, and heuristics                of process engineers and operators to be incorporated into an                   automated reasoning system.  The expert system would apply this                 knowledge in real time by accessing plant measurements through                  the process control computer.  This system will be designed in                  modular form so that complex plants can be decomposed and                       computer logic for individual units be developed separately (and                recombined in subsequent iterations).  The specific problems that               will be addressed in this project include:  (1) theoretical                     development of new algorithms for disturbance location and                      discrimination which account for realistic factors such as noisy                and time-varying data; (2) the development of a theory and                      methodology of diagnosis based on uncertain reasoning techniques,               to replace the current theory based on Boolean logic; (3)                       research on expert system architectures for integration of                      heuristic and model-based inferences; (4) basic research leading                to development of guidelines for optimal process                                instrumentation to increase the effectiveness of the new                        diagnostic systems; (5) a theoretical study of qualitative fault                simulation to provide accurate qualitative predictions of the                   effects of malfunctions on plant operations; and (6) the                        implementation of theoretical ideas in more complex and realistic               simulations, to test methodology, and to give further insight on                how to improve and extend the current diagnostic system.",
