Students          will have substantial hands-on experience with real data about real             problems of interest to them, and will gain understanding of both the           power and limitations of statistics.  The statistics laboratory is based        on:                                                                                                                                                             o  microcomputers having the memory and calculating facililty to make           effective use of complex statistical and data management programs on            large data sets;                                                                                                                                                o  the SPSS and MINITAB statistical packages, related graphics programs,        relational data base programs, and data communication programs;                                                                                                 o  data files, some from each of the several disciplines, containing            real information of significant current interest to social scientists;          and                                                                                                                                                             o  lab assistants trained in the technical details involved in running          the several programs against the various files.",
