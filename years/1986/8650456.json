 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to introduce gas chromatography/mass spectrometry             (GC/MS) capability into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the           University of Scranton, both in course-related laboratory work and in           independent student research.  To accomplish this aim, a benchtop gas           chromatograph/mass spectrometer will be purchased.  The instrument will         be configured for capillary GC, and will be supported by a complete data        system including a spectral library.  It will be used by undergraduates         to learn principles and applications of GC/MS in the organic,                   instrumental and advanced inorganic course sequences, and to gain               experience with computer-controlled data acquisition and analysis.  It          will also provide students with a powerful modern technique for use in          their varied research projects, many of which involve significant work          in drug analysis and petroleum exploration.",
