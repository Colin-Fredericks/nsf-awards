 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a cooperative effort between the New Mexico Museum of           Natural History and the Center for Rural Education of New Mexico State          University.  It brings together scientists and educators for the purpose        of improving science education in rural elementary schools.                                                                                                     The project will develop hands-on kits and working models on a number of        related topics.  Kits will use locally available specimens, background          material, scientific apparatus, and suggested activities to teach               natural science concepts.  Working models such as stream tables to              demonstrate the evolution of landforms and terraria mini-environments to        demonstrate ecological relationships will be developed.  Teachers'              manuals will be written and workshops offered to train teachers to              properly use the kits. Teachers will also receive training in the               development of additional kits specific to their local conditions.  The         materials will be designed for use with multi-cultural populations and          will build upon existing knowledge of rural children.  Activities also          include the establishment of out-of-school natural science clubs.",
