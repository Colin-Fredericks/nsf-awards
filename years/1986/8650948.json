Field data concerning          snow, ice and the lower atmosphere is being recorded and analyzed.  In          laboratory and field locations, the measurement and analysis of the             micro-climatology of snow and ice is being done by students, for the            first time in a new sophomore course, and with substantially increased          scale and sophistication in the mandatory Senior Thesis program.  The           equipment is particularly well suited to the study of nearby snow and           rime-ice environments at elevations above treeline in the Green                 Mountains of Vermont (an ongoing study at Middlebury College).",
