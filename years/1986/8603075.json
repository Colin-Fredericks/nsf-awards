 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project involves development of new semiconductor device           concepts associated with intraband (as opposed to interband) processes,         related device physics, and related infrared (IR) experiments.  Devices         include quantum well IR detectors and sources, as well as extrinsic             silicon IR detectors employing unconventional modes of detection.               Modeling will be carried out to decrease compositional control demands          on previously proposed quantum well IR detector structures which offer          the possibility of high quantum efficiency, narrow band detection and           fewer materials problems than narrow gap long wavelength detectors like         HgCdTe which employ interband transitions.  Improvements in quantum             well intraband transition photon sources will be studied.  Near IR              intraband quantum well devices require larger barrier heights and               indirect gap materials.  Compositionally simple (GaAs-AlAs) devices             also involve indirect gap barriers.  The effect of high indirect gap            barriers on carrier dynamics will be examined as an extension of                theoretical work already begun on the interaction of electrons and              holes with barriers.  That work includes the effect of lattice mismatch         and will be extended to include the effect of strain.",
