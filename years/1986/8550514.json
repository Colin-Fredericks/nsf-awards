 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 30 exemplary middle school             mathematics teachers from the Houston, Texas area.  The overall goals of        the multiyear project involve the updating and deepening of the                 participants' mathematical backgrounds and teaching methodology, the            networking of the participants, the conduct of in-service workshops by          the participants in their home schools, the dissemination of the project        materials and results to nearby school systems, and the investigation of        the modelistic approach within a carefully planned documentation,               assessment and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                               Working under the assumption that leadership potential involves special         characteristics, the project team and Advisory Board, which consists of         representatives for 10 cooperating school districts, will engage in a           thorough selection process.  Documentation of the individual                    participant's entering characteristics and the competencies developed           through project activities will contribute to the overall project               evaluation.                                                                                                                                                     Participants will complete four special mathematics courses designed to         encompass the CUPM recommendations for junior high school teachers,             earning 12 graduate semester credits for the University of Houston.             They will study with university faculty chosen for their excellence in          teaching teachers.  Mathematics studies will include ideas from                 mathematical problem solving, probability and statistics, history of            mathematics, abstract algebra, number theory, and geometry.                     Participants will also complete 15 graduate semester hours of studies           related to the pedagogy of middle school mathematics.  Uses of                  microcomputers, diagnosis and remediation, and problem-solving                  strategies will be featured.  During the in-service workshops which the         participants will design and conduct, project staff will be available           for consultation and support.  Participants will be visited, observed,          and videotaped in their classrooms and in their workshops with their            peers.  Careful documentation and analysis of these observations and            recordings will provide a significant basis for a detailed project              evaluation.",
