 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the innovations governments might use to improve the                     effectiveness of hazard mitigation and management is actuarial funding.         This involves the regular payment of estimated average annual                   hazard-induced infrastructure losses into a fund earmarked for use in           hazard mitigation and recovery.  Actuarial funding may contribute to            more efficient land use patterns and the construction of infrastructure         that is less susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural           hazards.  This project will systematically evaluate the potential use           of actuarial funding as a means of coping with infrastructure losses            from earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.  Data will be collected from          a cross-section of local and state governments and several                      disaster-struck communities.",
