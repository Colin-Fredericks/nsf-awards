 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high performance liquid chromatography system will be used to teach           principles of HPLC to undergraduate science and engineering students at         Manhattan College and the College of Mount St. Vincent.  The system will        be used in four integrated, upper-division laboratory courses.  In these        courses, students develop skills and techniques in the analytical,              instrumental, physical, synthetic, and biochemical areas.  Experiments          are sequenced so that basic skills are learned first, with a progression        toward sophisticated, project-oriented work in the final course.                                                                                                The project involves both the use of previously tested protocols and the        development of new experiments.  Their object will be teaching students         the principles and applications of HPLC.  Several specific                      chromatographic modes will be used:  normal phase, reverse phase, ion           exchange, and gel permeation.  In addition, several types of detectors          will be used: UV/visible variable wavelength absorbance, refractive             index, fluorescence, and electrochemical.  The curriculum is designed so        that fundamental principles are learned in the early labs, while                students in the later courses use the HPLC as an investigative tool for         topics such as kinetics.",
