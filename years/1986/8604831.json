 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will set up a multi-probe experimental approach to the study of          the metal-semiconductor interface formation in GaAs (100) and other             III-V compound semiconductors, with the goal of simultaneously                  determining structural (both electronic and morphoogical) and                   electrical transport properties of the interface under study.  In this          way it will be possible to correlate the information about the Schottky         barrier obtained by the local probes (photoelectron spectroscopy with           synchrotron radiation) with that obtained by macroscopic probes (I-V            and C-V measurements) in situ, without disturbing the sample.  Such             data will be of crucial importance in evaluating which of the theories          put forward recently best describes the Schottky barrier, both during           its formation and in the final stages of the extended interface.  Also,         they will have a direct relevance in the technology of GaAs processing          by clarifying which of the interface structural parameters has a direct         and verifiable influence on the device performances, i.e., on its               transport properties.",
