 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solitons are localized, moving, nonlinear pulses of energy that are             known to propagate without change in shape or amplitude in many                 lossless, nonlinear, uniform systems.  In nonuniform systems, however,          the soliton properties usually change as it travels through the                 nonuniformity.  The proposed research is an analytical and numerical            study of the characteristics of solitons in nonuniform systems.  The            purpose of the investigation is to explore how the nonuniformity of a           nonlinear medium can be tailored to achieve certain desired                     modifications of the soliton such as reshaping, amplification,                  compression, or reflection.  It is proposed to consider three different         systems in which the nonuniformity is controllable:  Solitons on                nonuniform nonlinear transmission lines; solitons on axially-nonuniform         optical fibers; and solitons in a nonuniform plasma bounded by a                grid-plate structure.  The results of the proposed investigation are            expected to have a more general applicability, however, because the             basic equations governing solitons in the three systems are identical           in form to those in several other systems of current interest such as           surface and internal water waves, acoustic waves in a crystal lattice,          and magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasmas.",
