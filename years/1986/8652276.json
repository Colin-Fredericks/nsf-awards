 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council, the principal operating agent of the             National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering,           has established a 36-member Board on Mathematical Sciences Education            (MSEB). Its primary purpose is to provide a continuing national                 assessment capability for mathematical sciences education at all levels.        The Board will provide leadership, service, and coordination through a          variety of activities and work products focussed on issues affecting the        quality of instruction in the mathematical sciences.                                                                                                            The purpose of two previous National Science Foundation grants was to           provide initial and supplemented support for activities in two targetted        problem areas, \"Framework and Alternative Models for School Mathematics         Curricula\" and \"Study of the Impact of Testing on Mathematics Education         K-14.\" Considerable progress has occurred during the past five months in        each of these areas of activity, and it is now appropriate for the MSEB         to undertake other initiatives in its original plan.                                                                                                            This grant will provide support for the MSEB to begin activities in             another important domain of national issues and problems resulting from         international comparisons of mathematical sciences education. In recent         years several such studies have been conducted. These have been reported        without ample opportunity for deliberation of implications for federal,         state, and local policies. Through the conduct of this special national         symposium the MSEB will stimulate and coordinate a major effort to:                                                                                                             --interpret significant results from various                    international investigations;                                                                   --develop policy implications and specific                      recommendations for improving mathematics education in American schools;        and                                                                                             --foster effective dissemination of these ideas through         special materials produced for, and subsequent to, the symposium.                                                                                               The National Academy of Sciences, acting through the MSEB, provides the         context and prestige necessary to attract significant researchers,              educators, governmental officials, and concerned citizens to this               important activity and to assure a nationwide attention by educational          policy makers.",
