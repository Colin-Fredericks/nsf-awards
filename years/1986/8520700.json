 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Phillip C. Wankat of Purdue has been a leading                        investigator in the use of absorption as an industrial                          purification method.  His latest research proposal covers a                     series of experiments to determine better methods to scale up                   this important process.  The theory he has developed indicates                  that the ratio of column length to the square of the absorbent                  diameter, and cycle period to column length should be kept                      constant as mass through-puts are increased.  This method should                be an improvement with strong economic implications for                         commercial practice.  The applications would include absorption,                ion-exchange, and chromatography.                                                                                                                               I recommend that Purdue Research Foundation be given a 3-year                   continuing grant to support Professor Wankat's research.  The                   amounts recommended are $56,517 for FY86, $55,197 for FY87, and                 $55,117 for FY88.",
