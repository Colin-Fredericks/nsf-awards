 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lesley College, a women's undergraduate college, proposes to develop a          program for preparing preservice middle school science and mathematics          teachers that is founded on the belief that the best middle school              teacher combines expertise in her subject area with strong pedagogical          and diagnostic skills.  Following the recommendation of the National            Middle School Association, the program will provide content                     concentration in two areas, science and mathematics.  The project will          design a sequence of 40 credits in mathematics and science, including           nine with a unique interdisciplinary focus.  In all, five science               courses, five mathematics courses, three interdisciplinary content              courses, and five professional courses will be developed or modified.           The interdisciplinary component will make explicit the implied                  interrelations between mathematics, science, society, and the teaching          profession.  The emphasis will be on methods of inquiry, criteria for           truth in different disciplines, and an understanding of the nature and          limits of knowledge.  The interdisciplinary component will culminate            with a student research project in the natural sciences that calls for          the use of scientific and behavioral science methods.  The 29-hour              professional education component will culminate in an integrating               seminar which will challenge students to create new visions and                 alternatives for curriculum development and education.  The program will        be developed by teams of scientists and educators.                                                                                                              The project will take advantage of collaborative relations with the             public schools and a science laboratory resource center at the college.         The project will also develop strategies for recruiting talented women          into the middle school teaching profession.  The entire project will be         carefully evaluated through the Program Evaluation and Research Group at        Lesley College; information about the program and its efforts will be           widely disseminated.",
