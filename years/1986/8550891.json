 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 50 nationally selected                 secondary school chemistry teachers in each of three years.  The overall        goals of the multiyear project involve the updating and deepening of the        participants' chemistry backgrounds and teaching methodologies, the             networking of the participants with university science faculty, the             conduct of planned in-service workshops by the participants in their            home schools and area colleges, appropriate recognition for honors-             teachers participants, the dissemination of the project materials and           results nationally, the investigation of the modelistic approach within         a carefully planned documentation, assessment and evaluation effort.                                                                                            The summer leadership institutes will be held on the Princeton                  University campus.  These will be staffed by four renowned university           scientists/chemical educators and by an outstanding secondary school            chemistry teacher with special expertise in computer applications to            chemistry teaching.  An advisory committee of distinguished scientists          and educators will guide the planning of the program and the conduct of         the evaluation and documentation activities.  Participants will be              encouraged to submit proposals for regional workshops conducted for             other teachers; modest grants to support materials purchase and other           costs will be available.",
