The working group will survey the                current state of vision research on aids for those with vision                  handicaps.  The legally blind or those with substantial loss of vision          may have a serious inability to move about in their normal environment,         even when limited to activity within the home.  The working group will          summarize the current status of our knowledge about the dimensions of           the mobility problem, the status of currently available technology, and         an assessment of limitations and future potential of mobility aids.  To         assist the working group, a two-day workshop of invited experts also            will be held, with the primary intent of promoting useful interaction           between visual researchers and those who can apply this knowledge to            manufacture effective, durable aids.",
