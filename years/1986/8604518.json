 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most promising fields within separations technology involves         permeation through membranes.  A particularly effective subcategory             within this field uses liquid membranes on a suitable support.  The             separation is achieved by a chemical carrier within the liquid that             combines with the desired component on one side of the membrane, by a           process called complexation, and is then released on the other side by          a reversal of the process.  This method is capable of high transfer             rates and effects the separation of desired species from mixtures               without high energy requirements for phase change or pressure drop.  A          three-person research team has been studying this separation phenomenon         with each specializing in an important aspect of the process.                   Preliminary results have been encouraging from the multi-faceted                challenges encountered in such a system.  What has been impressive thus         far is the success that has resulted from using mathematical modeling           to identify and resolve experimental differences from theoretical               expectations.  Certain of the models have served to guide the course of         the research plan and yield improved systems.",
