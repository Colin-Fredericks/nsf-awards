 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 60 exemplary secondary school          mathematics teachers from rural Nebraska school districts.  The overall         goals of the multiyear project involve:  1) the updating and deepening          of the participants' mathematics backgrounds and teaching methodologies,        2) the networking of the participant Fellows, six outstanding secondary         mathematics teachers selected to be part of the project staff as Senior         Fellows and the six university and college mathematics faculty, 3) the          conduct of implementations of problem-solving lessons in participants'          classrooms, 4) the conduct of at least four all-day in-service workshops        by the participants for their colleagues in their home schools, 5)              appropriate recognition for honors teacher participants, 6) the                 dissemination of the project methods, materials and results to nearby           school systems and rural states, and 7) the investigation of the                modelistic approach within a carefully planned documentation, assessment        and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                                          Selections of the 60 project Fellows and six Senior Fellows will be             based upon detailed applications requiring expressions of teacher and           school commitments to implement project emphases.  Twenty Fellows, two          Senior Fellows and two professors will study together at each of three          sites (UN-Lincoln, Chadron State College, and Hastings College), all            completing a similar program of professional development after three            years which will include 6 graduate mathematics courses, 3 computer             seminars and 3 dissemination seminars (24 graduate credits from UN-             Lincoln).  The participants will complete a five-week intense                   residential workshop each summer, rotating as a group to a different            campus each summer.                                                             Participants will be visited and observed in their classrooms and in            their workshops with their peers, and each will prepare a videotaped            session to be shared with project staff and participants.  Careful              documentation and analysis of these observations and of teacher reports         will provide a significant basis for a detailed project evaluation, both        by project staff and expert external evaluators.",
