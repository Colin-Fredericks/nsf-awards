 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve significantly the chemistry laboratory                curriculum by giving students relevant instruction and hands-on                 experience with a modern state-of-the-art Fourier transform infrared            spectrophotometer (FT-IR).  Also students will have a first-hand                opportunity to use computer-controlled data manipulation and collection         techniques.  The project will allow students to investigate, identify,          and characterize the structures of unknown compounds and compounds which        they synthesize.  The computer and associated software will permit              students to control the instrument and select methods of data                   collection, storage, search, and manipulation.  The project will be             implemented by expansion of current experiments and development and/or          incorporation of new experiments.  The FT-IR will be used in Organic            Chemistry Laboratory, Techniques of Dynamics, Chemical Instrumentation,         Inorganic Synthesis and Characterization, Instrumental Analysis, and            Senior Research Experience.  Enhancement of student laboratory                  experience through the operation of a computer-controlled FT-IR will            provide students with a better, more relevant preparation for continued         study in graduate school and for careers in  industrial laboratories.",
