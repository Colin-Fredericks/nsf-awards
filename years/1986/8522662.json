The goal of the           Center is to enhance the competitive position of U.S. industry through          improvement of the engineering knowledge base and training of engineers         in net shape manufacturing processes.  The Center's research program            will seek to integrate part design, material selection, and process             selection, design, and control.  Specific projects will be selected,            pursued, and monitored in collaboration with industry.  Undergraduate           education will be included in the Center through honors research and            seminars, cooperative education, and summer internships.  Graduate              education will focus upon master's and doctorate programs, with                 corporate-named fellowships to improve the participation of U.S.                citizens in the programs.  Students will also spend some time on                location in the research facilities of participating companies.  The            Center will also extend its educational influence through a consortium          of Ohio colleges and universities with manufacturing programs.",
