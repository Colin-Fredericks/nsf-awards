 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides computer equipment for the analysis of geomagnetic        pulsations observed in magnetometer data from various satellite and             ground-based observatories.  The instrumentation will alleviate a               significant limitation of current efforts by providing a small,                 multiuser computer system compatible with those currently in wide use in        this field.  The principal investigator has collaborated with The Johns         Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in analysis of satellite          magnetometer data.  He is developing ultra-low frequency (ULF) wave             display and analysis software for the magnetometer data from several            operating satellites as well as future missions.                                                                                                                Past and current work at Augsburg College, in collaboration with                scientists at several institutions, has resulted in a variety of                contributions to the understanding of ULF pulsations in the earth's             magnetosphere, and contributes to the education and research experience         of undergraduates who later pursue graduate study and/or careers in             science and engineering.  The major application of this effort (waveform        analysis) is particularly well suited to undergraduate student research.        Applications include reduction and analysis of data obtained from the           South Pole, and participation in the Space Physics Analysis Network.            This project continues a strong                                                 undergraduate research program, increases its productivity, and enables         additional qualified students to participate.",
