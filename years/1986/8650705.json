A sequence of three lab courses requires students to take             increasing responsibility for conducting psychological research; and an         increased number of students are enjoying improvements in the quality           and variety of research projects available to them in the labs.  Student        research projects also are being automated using Macintosh                      microprocessors, along with the software needed to control ten research         stations and to support data management, statistical analysis, and              graphics functions.  Test chambers using either rats or pigeons as              subjects have been procured, further increasing the range of                    observations that can be made.",
