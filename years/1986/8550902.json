 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Agency for Instructional Technology, in partnership with a                  consortium or more than 25 state education agencies, is in the process          of developing Mathematics for the '80s, a collection of high-quality            video and print materials that support mathematics teaching in grades           4-6.  Materials for grades 4 and 5 have already been developed.  This           grant will provide partial support for the development of the grade 6           materials.                                                                                                                                                      The project will develop a series of eighteen 15-minute instructional           television programs, together with a teacher's guide that will include          worksheets for students.  The series will emphasize problem-solving and         applications.  Consortium agencies will distribute the materials within         their states, via public and non-commercial cable television                    transmission, for example, and they may authorize off-air recording of          the television programs and duplication of print materials for                  educational use within their legal jurisdictions.  Nonconsortium                agencies will offered an opportunity to contract with the Agency for            similar rights.",
