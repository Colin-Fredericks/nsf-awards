 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will train 260 science teachers and                     administrators in the Pikes Peak region to use the computer to enhance          learning/teaching.  Thirty of those participants will be trained as             leaders in educational computing in their school districts.  Upon               completion of year three, these district leaders should be fully trained        to prepare and supervise science teachers in educational computing.  The        task of maintaining the teacher preparation activities will be assumed          by these leaders with support from their districts.                                                                                                             During year three, the project staff will concentrate on evaluating the         effectiveness of this teacher preparation model, and establishing a             self-sustaining teacher preparation network in the Pikes Peak region.           The network will include advisory committees on educational computing in        the sciences within each district and a committee for the Pikes Peak            region to facilitate interactions among cooperating districts.  During          year three, the project will be operating independent of the project            staff, and the management of the network will be the responsibility of          the districts.",
