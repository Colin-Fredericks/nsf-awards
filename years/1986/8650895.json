 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to integrate into the chemistry laboratory          curriculum multi-element Fourier transform NMR capability.  Acquisition         of an 80-MHz Fourier transform NMR will facilitate the research efforts         of the undergraduate chemistry majors, and will allow students to               measure and interpret NMR spectra of a number of elements besides               hydrogen, such as carbon-13, phosphorus-31, and cobalt-59.  Students            will be introduced to FT-NMR with routine applications in the                   introductory organic chemistry laboratory, and will progress in more            advance courses through increasingly sophisticated and specialized              applications of this powerful experimental tool.  Chemistry students            will first use the instrument independently in the sophomore-level              course Synthesis of Chemical Compounds.  In the course Interpretive             Spectroscopy, the FT-NMR will provide students with rigorous experience         in the application of NMR spectra to structural problems.  In laboratory        courses in Chemical Analysis, Chemical Instrumentation, and Physical            Measurements, students will study and exploit fast Fourier transform            techniques and the computer capability of the instrument. Through this          new experimental capability, the instrument will produce a significant          improvement in chemistry education at Juniata College.",
