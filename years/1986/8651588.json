 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a National Science Foundation and National Bureau of            Standards outreach program for faculty of minority institutions.                                                                                                The proposed conference presents an opportunity for NSF to acquaint 25          faculty members from 15-20 minority institutions with relevant NSF              programs and NSF in general.  It also provides an opportunity for NSF           program officers to identify key people at minority institutions who can        facilitate the identification of potential reviewers and who can                identify researchers and encourage participation in NSF programs.                                                                                               The strengths of the proposal are that  (1) prior conferences have been         judged useful to the National Bureau of Standards,   (2) joint                  sponsorship will significantly reduce the costs for all sponsoring              agencies and programs, (3) this form of activity moves beyond passive           approaches of individual programs and acts as a catalyst for the whole          Foundation.",
