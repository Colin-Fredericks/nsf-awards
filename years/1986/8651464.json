 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center of Excellence for the Enrichment of Science and Mathematics          Education at the University of Tennessee at Martin is charged with the          responsibility of rendering service to public schools in mathematics and        science education in the state of Tennessee.  This project is designed          to provide that service in elementary science in three Educational              Service Centers in rural settings.  Teams consisting of one primary             teacher, one intermediate teacher, one principal, and one supervisor,           all from the same school, will be formed.  A major effort will be made          to find minority participants and those interested in mainstreaming             handicapped children. Three of these teams will be formed in each of the        three Education Service Centers.  These teams of exemplary educators            will participate in an intensive eight-week summer session designed to          increase competency in content and teaching strategies.  Once trained,          they will redesign the elementary science programs in their home                schools.  When that task is complete, the teams will move on to serve           other institutions.  These involvements will take the form of team              members working in classrooms as trainers of teachers and with                  appropriate administrators.  Support for the teaching teams during the          academic year will be provided by \"Level III\" teachers who will serve as        field supervisors, the science consultant for the State Department of           Education, and the project staff.",
