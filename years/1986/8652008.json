Teachers and research-mentors with similar interests will work together.                                                                                        For eight weeks in the summer of 1987 each teacher will review the              literature, tools, and techniques needed to be involved in a research           project.  During the academic year of 1987-88 the teacher will continue         the research project after school or on weekends.  At least one meeting         per month will be held with the mentor-scientists.  A major focus during        this period will be discussions of how the knowledge and skills learned         can be incorporated into the teaching strategies of the classroom.  For         eight weeks during the summer of 1988 the teachers will again be in the         laboratories of mentor-scientists.  At the end of the second summer each        participant will prepare a written report.",
