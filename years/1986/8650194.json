 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade the General Psychology Laboratory by phasing          out the use of animals and replacing obsolete equipment with a computer-        based laboratory.  Thirty-six Apple IIe computers and a Corvus Omninet          will be used to develop an instructional lab to teach 500 students each         semester.                                                                                                                                                       The purpose of the lab is to provide hands-on experience with                   contemporary research projects in psychology.  Psychology majors will be        exposed to research projects from a variety of areas in psychology and          will acquire laboratory skills necessary for more advanced courses.             Freshmen who use General Psychology to fulfill their university science         requirement will become acquainted with research projects using up-to-          date methodology and thus obtain a much more adequate introduction to           science and scientific methodologies.",
