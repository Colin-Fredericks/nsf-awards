 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science, Durham,          North Carolina, will create a 2000 square foot permanent exhibition,            \"The Science Behind Medicine\", using recent advances in medical science         and technology to illustrate basic science concepts.  It will engage            visitors through their strong interest in health and medicine, present          valuable information about medical subjects, and use their interest to          present underlying scientific concepts they would otherwise avoid.                                                                                              The exhibition will be organized around four topics:  organ structure           and function and organ replacement and transplantation; advances in             medical imaging, including infrared, ultrasound and x-ray technologies;         pharmaceutical pharmacology, biological receptors and molecular design;         and sickle cell anemia and its molecular biology.  Over five years, more        than one million people will use the exhibit, including both highly             educated residents of the Research Triangle area, and a Durham                  population that is disadvantaged and 50% black.                                                                                                                 Extensive subject area consultation and formative evaluation will be            used in exhibition design.  A close consulting relationship is planned          with two museums with similar exhibit interests, and exhibit research           and plans will be offered to other interested museums to encourage wider        use of the project's results.                                                                                                                                   A strong regional health sciences focus will benefit the project through        academic, business, community and industry membership on a project              planning committee, and from 50% local matching funding.   Two corporate        planning grants have been awarded to the project, and a major facilities        expansion funded in part by a recent bond issue.",
