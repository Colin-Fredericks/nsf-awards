 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building panels made of glass fiber reinforced concrete are                     increasingly used as exterior cladding for buildings which are being            renovated and also for new construction.  Field experience has                  indicated that these panels have exhibited reduced tensile strength and         a loss of ductility with time.  The reduced strength may be accounted           for in the initial design of the panels, but the ductility aspects are          not known sufficiently to be included in the design calculations.  This         project will determine the long-term behavior of the glass fiber panels         to account for it properly in the initial stages of design.  Several            parameters will be investigated such as:  types of fiber, additions of          polymer latex and pozzolans and curing conditions.",
