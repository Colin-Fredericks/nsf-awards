Several hundred                 bioscience instructional programs, developed for populations of non-            handicapped students, will be identified.  The project staff will then          select and modify about 30 of these which meet specific criteria                required for use by the target audience. Modifications will include             changes in the content of the software and the use of more basic and            concrete instruction, a simplified vocabulary, grammatical structures           more understandable to the deaf students, and increased numbers of              visuals.                                                                                                                                                        The project will field test the software with deaf students who are on          the campus of Gallaudet College in Washington, DC.  These students will         be 9th through 12th graders at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf,         and freshmen and sophomores in undergraduate programs of the College.                                                                                           The goal of the project is to improve the availability of microcomputer         programs in secondary and post-secondary institutions for teaching deaf         students across the United States.  These include some 900 high                 schools/programs/classes for deaf students, and 75 post-secondary               programs serving the deaf.",
