 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 40 outstanding biology teachers        nationwide. Former NSF Honors Workshop participants will help to                identify the Summer 1986 participants through a thorough selection              process.  Documentation of the individual  participant's entering               knowledge and the competencies developed through project activities will        contribute to the overall project evaluation. Upon completion of the            project, the participants will become eligible for membership in the            National Network to Implement Human Genetics and Bioethics education.           The project's four week summer component will be offered at Ball State          University and will be followed by an academic year component designed          to assist participants in achieving project goals.                                                                                                              The overall goals will provide the participants with renewal and                updating in human genetics and bioethics education, use Network teachers        to implement inservice workshops that will disseminate knowledge and            instructional materials to peers of the 1986 participants, and to               evaluate the impact of the National Network in implementing project             goals.",
