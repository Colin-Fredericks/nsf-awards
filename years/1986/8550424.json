 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 24 exemplary mathematics               teachers and 48 of their less well-prepared school colleagues.  The             overall goals of the project involve the updating and deepening of the          participants' mathematical backgrounds and teaching methodologies, the          networking of the participants, the conduct of frequent school- and             campus-based helping and sharing sessions by the participants and               project staff, and the investi-gation of the modelistic approach within         a carefully planned documentation, assesssment and evaluation effort.           Participants will be carefully selected to assure commitments of the            leader teacher, their two peers, and their school administrators to the         project goals.                                                                                                                                                  The project will operate from a conceptual model of teacher education           which encompasses five phases for constructing new knowledge for                leadership activities:  demonstration, practice, feedback, coaching for         transfer, and coaching for leadership.  In the first summer 24 high             school algebra teachers will participate in a three-week workshop on the        campus of Michigan State University.  They will study the conceptual            development of elementary algebra as well as new applications in coding         theory and linear programming, observe teaching demonstrations with             beginning algebra students, and develop plans and activities for                implementation into their own teaching.  During the next school year the        teachers will integrate new teaching practices and algebraic                    applications into their classes, which project staff will visit at least        three times for coaching sessions.  The entire group will meet three            times (5 days) back on the campus to share and assess progress and to           plan for the outreach during the second year. During a one-week summer          conference, the 24 honors teachers wil work with two peers to begin             their team improvement.  During the 1987-88 school year the lead                teachers will continue to coach these outreach teachers, who will be            visited and also coached by the principal investigators.",
