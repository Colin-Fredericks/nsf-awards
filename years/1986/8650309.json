 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to provide the modern laboratory research        equipment needed for establishing a contemporary teaching program in            Plant Physiology.  The improvement plans are the results of an extensive        evaluation of the Biology Department by external and internal reviewers.        The equipment is being used to create largely an upper-division Plant           Physiology course, but some of it also will be used in other upper              division courses and in a newly revised Introductory Biology course.                                                                                            The Plant Physiology course stresses techniques and concepts that are           unique to plants (photosynthesis, transpiration, water relations), but          also includes projects that will familiarize students with generally            applicable techniques while illustrating principles in Plant Physiology         (spectral analysis of pigments, tissue culture, photomorphogenesis).            The laboratory equipment covers experiments with photosynthesis (an             oxygen electrode); transpiration (a porometer); water relations (a              pressure chamber and psychrometer); tissue culture (a laminar flow              hood); spectral analysis (a scanning spectrophoto-meter); and                   photomorphogenesis (an image analysis system and a thermopile). Students        using the equipment learn what types of questions each technique can            answer.  They then design and carry out their own experiments.  It is           expected that this experience will increase their appreciation for how          science proceeds, as well as for the principles of plant physiology.            Many students do laboratory research in their senior year, and many go          on to graduate school or medical school.  This experience with modern           equipment and experiment design should serve them well.  This project           has the potential for becoming a model in modern plant physiology which         other undergraduate institutions might adopt.",
