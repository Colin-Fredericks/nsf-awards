 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Department at St. Olaf College will integrate symbolic,         numerical, and graphical computing tools into its elementary calculus           course.  Department faculty will cooperate in teaching the first                offerings of the revised courses, and in preparing and improving course         materials appropriate to this goal.  Grant money will be used to equip a        symbolic computation laboratory, running SMP on nine graphics-capable           terminals. These consist of a SUN 3/160M-4 central mode, two SUN 3/75-4         stations, and six Heath/Zenith computers with high-resolution graphics          boards.  The laboratory will be used by elementary calculus students to         complete assignments designed to exploit a powerful, interactive                symbolic computation program.  By handling some of the routine                  operations, symbolic manipulation programs can allow students to see            ideas beyond the computations of calculus.  With the computing power to         support treatment of discrete and numerical (as well as continuous)             ideas, calculus instruction gives a truer picture of its subject,               highlights calculus ideas, and makes more of calculus' power available          to students.",
