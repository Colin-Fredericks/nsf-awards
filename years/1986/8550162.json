 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 40 exemplary secondary school          physical science teachers from 15 counties throughout central and               northern California.  The overall goals of the multiyear project involve        the updating and deepening of the participants' physical science                backgrounds and teaching methodologies, the networking of the                   participants and university science faculty, the conduct of in-service          workshops by the participants in their home schools, appropriate                recognition for honors teacher participants, the dissemination of the           project materials and results to nearby school systems, and the                 investigation of the modelistic approach within a carefully planned             documentation, assessment and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                Selections of participants by a faculty and school committee will be            based upon detailed applications requiring expressions of teacher and           school commitments to implement project emphases.  Working with                 university scientists, a full-time science curriculum specialist and            four mentor teachers, the participants will complete a three-week summer        workshop and monthly day-long meetings designed to increase their               conceptual understanding of physical sciences, to develop strategies and        materials for teaching thorough understanding of fundamental concepts           and principles, and to develop materials and techniques for use in their        presentation of in-service workshops.  Participants will earn academic          credits from the University of California, Davis.  During the in-service        workshops which the participants will design and conduct, the science           curriculum specialist and other project staff will be available for             consultation and support.  Participants will be visited and observed in         their classrooms and in their workshops with their peers.  Careful              documentation and analysis of these observations and of teacher reports         will provide a significant basis for a detailed project evaluation.",
