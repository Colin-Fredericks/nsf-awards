These lectures are           to become a regular component of those courses.  The students will have         studied basic principles prior to the industrial presentations so they          are prepared to understand and appreciate the \"real world\" problems and         solutions presented by the industry engineers.  The program is designed         to allow academic institutions to more effectively utilize the                  resources of industry during the undergraduate education of engineers.",
