 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to identify key areas of mechanics              research to improve paper technologies.  The workshop will address the          following specific areas of mechanics research for paper technologies:          mechanical properties of paper products, environmental effects, such as         temperature and humidity, modeling and simulation of the mechanical             behavior and experimental paper mechanics.  The workshop will identify          key solid mechanics research issues and develop an appropriate strategy         to guide the development of mechanics principles for technologies and           processes to produce and utilize paper.  A published report of                  recommendations will be prepared and submitted to NSF.  This workshop           provides an opportunity, for the first time, to bring together the              paper industry with researchers in mechanics and to identify priority           research issues to enhance paper technologies.",
