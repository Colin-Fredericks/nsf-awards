 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research deals with the buckling or crushing of tubes under the             action of a line of concentrated forces in the transverse direction.            The research entails both an analytical and experimental component.             The end product would be a user friendly computer code for predicting           the crushing strength of the composite tubes based on the properties of         the composite material used to wind the tubes.  The code would be               verified and modified, if necessary, based on the results of an                 extensive series of experiments.  Composite structures are well known           for their high strength-to-weight ratio and high rigidity-to-weight             ratio.   In spite of the extensive research in developing composite             structures for airframes and space applications during the past 20              years, the basic issues such as delamination, effect of joints, impact          damage, and buckling failure of tube and shell structures are yet to be         resolved.  The results of this research would upgrade the                       state-of-the-art understanding of the crushing strength and failure of          laminated composite tubes used in pipes and conduits.",
