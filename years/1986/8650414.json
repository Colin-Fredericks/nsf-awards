 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the establishment of a cooperative advanced           physics laboratory among the institutions of Five Colleges, Inc.:               Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith                College, and the University of Massachusetts.  The purpose of the course        is to provide undergraduate physics majors at the five colleges with            intensive, comprehensive experience with state-of-the-art                       instrumentation -- experience currently missing from the usual                  undergraduate curriculum.  The equipment will be used to create a               repertoire of advanced physics experiments built on the strengths of the        individual departments.  Each department will contribute and host               experiments in a particular field, with all of the experiments made             available to any advanced physics students at any of the five colleges.         Amherst will be the site for atomic physics, Mount Holyoke for nuclear          physics, Smith for cosmic ray physics, and the University for low               temperature physics and microwave radiometry.  This local cooperative           enterprise is the logical solution to the problem of giving students a          broad background in experimental techniques while simultaneously                augmenting the special strengths of the departments individually.",
