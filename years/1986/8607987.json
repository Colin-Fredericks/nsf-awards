Attention will be focused on topics of            considerable recent growth and potential impact on the science,                 engineering, and technology of separation and purification.  The                conference will seek to promote interdisciplinary interaction in the            above areas because of the potential benefits of such interaction.  The         conference will bring together speakers and discussion leaders who are          experts in their field.  This conference has been very successful in            the past in achieving its goals and is expected to contribute further           to advances in separation science and technology.",
