 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university and two industrial partners are developing a 2-year              educational program on Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems                  Applications, Computer-Aided Design, and Very Large Scale Integrated            Circuits Design and Fabrication.  Industrial experts present                    significant components of the two courses involved.  The project also           involves installation of a KU-band transmitter, a control room, and a           studio classroom to support satellite distribution of the university            courses to remote audiences.  Satellite receivers at KU and C bands             plus video display and distribution facilities are being installed              currently at the university.  The courses use the latest interactive TV         and tutored video techniques, supplemented by personal contact between          all students and the course lecturers.  Detailed evaluation is to be            undertaken to compare all methods employed with respect to educational          efficiency and student and faculty reaction to their use.",
