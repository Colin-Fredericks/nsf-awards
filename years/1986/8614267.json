 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to establish two distinct facilities to                obtain, process and enhance polar orbitting satellite imagery of                Antarctica.  One system will be located at McMurdo Station                      Antarctica where it will obtain, and record real time imagery                   from the TIROS-N and DMSP series satellite for use in weather                   forecasting in support of Antarctic inter and intra continental                 aircraft flight operations.  In addition, this system will                      provide investigators who deploy to Antarctic an opportunity to                 preview imagery tapes prior to further analysis at the facility                 to be established in the U.S.                                                                                                                                   In conjunction with the McMurdo facility, a complementary                       computer system will be established at the Scripps Institute of                 Oceanography.  Its function will be to archive the tapes                        collected in Antarctica via the image receive system, and will                  provide the capability to manipulate the data digitally to                      enhance the specific remote sensing information embedded in the                 imagery obtained from the sensors onboard the satellites.                                                                                                       These facilities are unique in their provision of Antarctic                     remote sensing data to the operational as well as the science                   research community.",
