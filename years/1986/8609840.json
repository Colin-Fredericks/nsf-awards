 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this effort is to develop a comprehensive model            for the strategic analysis of materials management within large-scale           production/distribution systems.  Such systems encompass the                    procurement of raw materials and intermediate products, the processing          of these inputs to produce outputs, and the distribution of the                 finished product through a distribution network.  The emphasis of this          work is on formulation of models and algorithms which can be sued to            predict the performance of a firm with respect to the cost of products,         the lvel of services provided to the firm's customers, and the                  responsiveness and flixibility of the production/distribution system.           This project will focus on the interactions between production and              distribution operations in various industrial settings.",
