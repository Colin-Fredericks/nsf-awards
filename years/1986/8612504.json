 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering Practice Introducing Course Sequence, an Interdisciplinary          Program at the university, uses bona-fide projects from industry or             government agencies to teach students problem-solving skills.  The              students work in teams on these open-ended problems; the industrial             engineer is their client; the professors are their mentors.  Funds are          supplied to enable experimentation with using projects from remote              industrial or government engineers--clients who because of distance             cannot meet face-to-face with the students.  The university uses                computer-telephone technology for communciations between these remote           clients and their project teams.  If successful, the experiment will            expand the project client pool and it will get the student more deeply          into computer use.  The experiment will use the Telewriter II-PC System         developed by Optel Communications, Inc., and the AT&T Alliance                  conferencing system.  This system allows interactive computer use               between stations along with voice-over conferencing.",
