 "awd_abstract_narration": "California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, is offering a         four-week summer workshop both in 1986 and in 1987 to provide in-depth          instruction in physical and earth science concepts for 48 elementary            school teachers from 24 schools.  The instruction will include many             hands-on experiential activities along with the opportunity for                 supervised practice of teaching strategies. Five follow-up visits will          be made to the participants during the academic year following the              summer workshop.  Project staff from both university and school levels          will make these on-site visits for the purpose of supporting the                teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The proposal is a result of an expressed need garnered through a grass          roots network called Science Cooperative for Outstanding Public                 Education (SCOPE), a county-wide network of teachers, administrators,           and others interested in improving science instruction in the schools.",
