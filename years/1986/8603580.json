 "awd_abstract_narration": "Washington University and Hewlett-Packard will engage in a cooperative          two year program of experimental and theoretical studies involving              applications of micromagnetics to problem areas in magnetic and                 magneto-optic recording.  The study areas are defined by the                    recognition of needs and by the experimental and computing resources of         a major industrial laboratory, and by the awareness of opportunities            for progress on the part of an academic principal investigator, one of          the founders of the discipline.  The proposed studies will deepen the           understanding of the magnetic and magneto-optic write and readout               processes.  One study will provide a basis for improvements in the              interpretation of the frequency response of magnetic readout.  Two              major investigations are directed at optimizing the design of                   longitudinal cobalt alloy thin film media, and at improving the                 understanding and control of double-layer perpendicular high density            recording media.  Another study is concerned with the realistic                 modeling of Cr0  patriculate media, using a combination of analytical           and numerical micromagnetic calculations.  One theoretical study will           examine the details of the thermal magneto-optic laser write process.",
