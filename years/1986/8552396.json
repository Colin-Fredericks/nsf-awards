 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System is embarking         on a comprehensive plan for the in-service education of teachers of             elementary, middle, and high school through the establishment of Science        Education Service Centers at three campuses of the University of                Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction will                 cooperate to develop a network of these model science education service         centers that will be designed to meet the diverse needs of science              teachers from all parts of the state.  The three initial center sites           chosen represent different population profiles:  (1) an urban corridor          where the minority population is highest, (2) a medium sized cities area        that has both an agricultural and industrial dependence with the highest        concentration of native Americans in the state, and (3) a low-density           population mostly dependent on agriculture which has attracted a large          concentration of Hmong immigrants.                                                                                                                              In the first year, the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Green Bay and UW-           Milwaukee Centers will provide in-service courses and activities for 75         high school teachers and 40 middle school teachers, respectively.  In           the second year, the UW-LaCrosse Center will begin operating--along with        the continuation of the other two Centers--for the benefit of 50                elementary school teachers.  All three Centers will continue to operate         at this level in years three and four.  Programs at each of the sites           include appropriate content courses, laboratory-based activities, and a         structured follow-up schedule insuring support for these participating          teachers.  A network of representatives from these three sites as well          as from other UW campuses will function as an advisory committee to this        project.  This network will also serve as an initiator for similar              Centers at additional campus sites throughout the state.",
