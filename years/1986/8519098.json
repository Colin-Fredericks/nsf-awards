 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has four aspects:  (1) new physical interpretations of             mass transfer rates between a turbulently flowing liquid and a solid            wall and oxygen absorption rates from turbulent air to a concurrently           flowing liquid are developed; (2) the dispersion of particles in                turbulently flowing fluids is studied to understand the influence of            fluid turbulence on the rate of deposition upon the pipe wall that              contains the flow; (3) the annular regime that exists for high velocity         gas-liquid flows has a film that moves along the wall plus droplets             entrained in the turbulent concurrently flowing gas.  Studies of the            rate of formation of drops by atomization of the wall film and the rate         of depositon of droplets on the wall film under actual annular flow             conditions are being conducted; and (4) measurements of the velocity            field for turbulent flow over a wave are being made to understand to            predict the pressure and shear forces on the wave.",
