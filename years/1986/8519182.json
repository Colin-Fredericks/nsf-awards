 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop statistical techniques to                monitor problems encountered during the operation of chemical                   plants.  In the past, process measurements and data acquisition                 were carried out by plant operators and engineers who checked the               accuracy and consistency of the data based on their knowledge and               experience.  These functions are now performed automatically by                 computers and techniques to properly analyze this data are                      needed.  The researchers will develop algorithms that reconcile                 measurement differences, estimate unmeasured variables, detect                  and identify gross errors, and efficiently monitor the process of               interest.  Process measurements are subject to two types of                     errors:  random errors which are commonly assumed to be normally                distributed with a mean of 0; and gross errors which are caused                 by non-random events such as equipment failure (e.g. leaks) as                  well as measurement errors due to malfunctioning instruments.                   Gross errors have to be eliminated before data reconciliation is                attempted.",
