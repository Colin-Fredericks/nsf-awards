 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the question of how an important computer               programming skill -- debugging -- is acquired by elementary and middle-         school children, and what the cognitive consequences are of acquiring           that skill.  One preliminary goal of the proposed research is the               development of a well-specified and empirically-supported account of            what a child has to know in order to debug a computer program.  The             proposed work extends preliminary studies of the debugging skills               acquired during the course of a normal LOGO curriculum, and it provides         for further assessment and elaboration of a computer-simulation model of        the precise components of debugging skill.                                                                                                                      The work will have several interacting components:  (1) Empirical               evaluation of the model based on a study of experienced programmers'            debugging processes; (2) Further development of precise assessment              procedures for determining what component skills a student has acquired;        (3) Extending the model to a wider range of programming contexts; (4)           Using the model to guide specific instructional procedures in teaching          debugging skills; (5) Extending and applying a complete one-semester            LOGO curriculum with an emphasis on instruction in an assessment of             debugging skills; (6) Determining the extent to which debugging skills,         once taught, can transfer to near and far tasks; (7) Construction of a          model-based prototype debugging aid on a powerful graphics workstation.",
