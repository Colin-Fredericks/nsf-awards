 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to establish a microcomputer laboratory in           psychology in order to improve undergraduate students' research                 experiences. Due to the large number of students and the relatively             small number of faculty members it has not been possible to give                undergraduate students at Southeastern Louisiana University research            experiences that they require if they are to gain an accurate                   appreciation of how research is conducted in psychology.                                                                                                        There are two aspects to this project -- one for students in lower level        psychology courses and one for students at the upper level.  In the             lower level courses, commercially available software packages allow             students to conduct replications of some of the classic experiments in          this discipline. In the upper level courses, microcomputers are being           used in original research projects involving precise measurement and            control.  Many of the projects involve interfacing the microcomputer            with experimental equipment already existing in the department.                 Students are introduced in the intermediate program to the process of           delimiting questions, posing falsifiable hypotheses and designing tests         of their validity.   More advanced students are able to conduct                 individual research studies or to participate in faculty projects.",
