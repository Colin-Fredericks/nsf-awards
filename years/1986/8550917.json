 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council, the principal operating agent of the             National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering,           has established a 36-member Board of Mathematical Sciences Education            (MSEB). Its primary purpose is to provide a continuing national                 assessment capability for mathematical sciences education at all levels.        The Board will provide leadership, service, and coordination through a          variety of work products focussed on issues affecting the quality of            instruction in the mathematical sciences.                                                                                                                       The conception of the MSEB has evolved through a broad base of input            from the mathematics and mathematics education communities. Emanating           from two national conferences on precollege mathematics education, the          Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences endorsed the recommendation of        its specially convened task force which urged the establishment of such         a board at the National Research Council.                                                                                                                       The MSEB will function with an anticipated outreach extending to the            state and local levels throughout the nation. Its activities will be            conducted through issue-oriented task forces that will report to the            Board. The membership is broadly representative to bring perspectives of        classroom teachers, local and state school authorities, educational             administrators and supervisors, local, state and federal governmental           officials, college and university faculties, leaders of professional            mathematics and education associations, parents, and employers. An              Executive Committee of the Board, chaired by Dr. Shirley A. Hill, will          help to guide the overall efforts. Appointments, reports, and other             Activities of the Board will follow the procedures of the National              Research Council.                                                                                                                                               The purpose of this National Science Foundation grant is to provide             initial support for activities in two targetted problem areas,                  \"Framework and Alternative Models for School Mathematics Curricula\" and         \"Study of the Impact of Testing on Mathematics Education K-14.\" Special         committees and panels will be operationalized to prepare concept papers         and to design study procedures, to conduct open forums and surveys, and         to return specified deliverables. It is expected that each of these             problem areas will receive continued attention during the second year of        anticipated support. In addition it is expected that a third domain of          activity, \"In-service Teacher Development\", will receive attention and          support.",
