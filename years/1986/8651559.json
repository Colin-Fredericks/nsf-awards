 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maryland Instructional Television, in conjunction with the National             Science Teachers Association, will use the expertise of scientists and          educators and the medium of television to create an exciting science            video series for children ages four through seven.  The activities of           the project include the identification of content, design of                    instructional video and ancillary print materials, and formative                evaluation.  Fifteen video programs will be developed, each containing          two or three separate sub-programs. These will be supplemented by               teacher and parent guides which will suggest activities designed to             expand upon the material covered in the program.                                                                                                                The series content and materials will explore everyday events in the            lives of young children and will integrate science and mathematics              concepts, skills and application into a variety of curricular areas.            The companion activities will make use of objects already in the child's        world or easily accessible in the home.                                                                                                                         This project is funded jointly with the Instructional Materials                 Development Program.",
