 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to design an approach to science                 instruction that takes into account some findings from cognitive                research.  It has been widely demonstrated that students come into the          classroom with invalid perceptions about physical phenomena which are           not altered by current forms of instruction.  Through interviews, this          project will document the general misconceptions held by students,              identify these for teachers, and develop methods which directly confront        the misconceptions.  The student materials will consist of a unit,              \"Models of Matter\", which will be modified to also confront the commonly        held misconceptions.  The final product will be an educational system           that integrates learning activities and teaching strategies to cause            conceptual change.                                                              The modified \"Models of Matter\" unit will be randomly assigned to 12 of         24 Lansing, Michigan Public School grade six classes to test its                effectiveness in increasing student achievement and promoting                   recommended teaching strategies.  The remaining 12 sixth grade classes          will use the unmodified \"Models of Matter\" unit.                                                                                                                The project expects to demonstrate how authors can use existing research        findings to modify commercial textbook units and teacher guides to              increase student learning.  Since most teachers structure their teaching        around a commercial textbook, the project has national significance for         improving student achievement in science.",
