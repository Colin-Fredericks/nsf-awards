 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association of Science-Technology Centers, representing some 170            science museums, receives regular requests for information on the status        of science museums, their education programs, exhibits and other                activities.  To respond to this need, the organization will collect and         analyze data on the status and activities of both member and non-member         science museums.                                                                                                                                                The material will be published as three reports and made available on           computer disks for further study.  The information is particularly              useful to communities considering new museums, and to trustees and              contributors to current museums and others who have an interest in the          priorities and policies of education and exhibits programs. The project         will be assisted by an advisory committee and Dr. Sue Smock, Director of        the Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University.",
