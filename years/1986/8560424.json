 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I study will examine the feasibility of SANDAMPER technology         as applied to the damping of tall buildings and structures.  Its                success and extensive application already to the guy-wires of tall TV           towers affords a high degree of confidence in the proposed.  The study          concerns an analytical investigation of a low frequency damping method          as it might be applied to high-rise building structures subject to              wind-induced vibration or instability.  In the feasibility study it             will be determined if the size of the damper can be scaled up to the            large dimensions required for high-rise buildings applications.  This           study is concerned with a specific innovative type of damper, the               SANDAMPER, which would be employed in a semi-passive mode as a tuned            mass damper (TMD).  The object is to develop design information from            fundamental scientific precepts, and to indicate practical                      applications.",
