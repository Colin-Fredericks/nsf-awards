 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry department at Susquehanna University introduces                   undergraduate students to \"hands-on\" use of modern instruments                  throughout their four-year program.  Recently the department has begun          interfacing major laboratory instrumentation to computers.  Currently,          students use nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry primarily for              identification and characterization of organic compounds in the                 sophomore organic course.  This project will extend students' experience        with NMR to include computer interfacing and sophisticated applications         in physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental analysis,              biochemistry, advanced organic chemistry, and undergraduate research.           Students will use a computerized data base of NMR spectra for direct            comparison of known spectra with spectra measured in their experiments.         In addition, they will have direct experience with the advantage of             multiple scans and computer enhancement of instrument signals. This             project will give the students more complete knowledge of the varied            applications of NMR spectrometry and prepare them to use modern                 computer-controlled instruments in industry and postgraduate research.",
