 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York Hall of Science will develop a major exhibition on quantum         theory--one of the most important developments in physical science in           this century and one which has not been significantly treated by science        museums.  This exhibition will be the first major museum program to             introduce quantum theory and its applications to the public.                                                                                                    Elements of the exhibit will include models of the atom, the puzzle of          light, applications of the theory and, finally, the human story of the          creation of a new theory.  Numerous participatory exhibits will be              developed in conjunction with the project so that visitors can learn by         doing.                                                                                                                                                          Formative evaluation will be an integral part of this exhibit.  This            technique has recently been adopted by museums as a way to test exhibit         prototypes with museum visitors and then redesign as necessary.  A              workshop will be held for museum personnel and a guidebook, Improving           Exhibits Through Formative Evaluation, will be produced.  This book will        be the first complete description of the formative evaluation process           and will be a valuable addition to the museum field.",
