Computer systems acquired through this project will support research            instruction in five behavioral science research areas, with researchers         in  anthropology and psychology initially involved in conducting                research seminars.  Computerized images of artifacts as an aid in               analysis and instruction, research in facial recognition and eyewitness         identification through construction, editing, combining and displaying          computerized images, and experiments in human memory and social judgment        in real or simulated group settings are among the activities to be              carried out.  The results of student research projects will be published        and presented at professional meetings.",
