 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Illinois University (SIU) has put together an interesting              three-part project to strengthen mathematics education within the               University and the greater St. Louis areas.  It will offer 32 teachers          of secondary school mathematics the following:  (1) the opportunity to          participate in a 6-week summer session which will emphasize problem             solving and the appropriate use of the computer in mathematics                  education, (2) the necessary guidance to develop useful classroom               materials for the teaching of mathematics and computer science, and (3)         the resources of the University in establishing a support network               through the creation of a mathematics resource center.                                                                                                          Participants will have a sufficiently good background in mathematics.           At least two, but no more than four, will be selected from a single             school to insure peer support in the school setting.  TenCo, a 10 county        microcomputer consortium, has not only expressed support for this               project, but has agreed to make its very large library of computer              software available to the University and participants of the program.                                                                                           Biweekly group meetings, patterned after the very successful meetings of        the elementary school Teachers' Center Project at SIU will be held              during the academic year for the purposes of exchanging information and         feedback on materials and their use.  Seminars will be held at both             campuses of SIU, at Edwardsville and East St. Louis, to insure continued        involvement of minority teachers.  These meetings will serve as the             basis of a local teacher \"network.\"  Group activities will include              programs of interest to University faculty, participants, and their             colleagues.",
