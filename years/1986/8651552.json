 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines changes in cognitive processes resulting from              instructional interventions and applies this information in developing a        prototype instructional program.  The cognitive processes of interest           are those involved in constructing meaning for decimal number symbols           and using the meaning to solve decimal number tasks.  Previous work             suggests that for many students, the lack of meaning for written symbols        is the source of low performance across a range of mathematical tasks.          Classroom instruction designed to promote cognitive processes that              create meanings for symbols is implemented and evaluated in the context         of decimal fractions.                                                                                                                                           Students in grades 4 and 5 will be instructed in whole classroom                settings. Written tests and a series of individual interviews will              provide information on changes in key cognitive processes and on how            such changes are induced by specific instructional events.  The                 information on cognitive change and instructional effectiveness,                gathered through a sequence of instructional studies, will be translated        into a prototype instructional program for developing meaning for               written symbols in mathematics.                                                                                                                                 Moving from research to practice, from descriptions of students'                performance to prescriptions of instructional programs, is a major              objective of this program of research.  In addition to providing new            knowledge and product outcomes, the project provides a model, based on          chain of inquiry notions, for translating research into practice.",
