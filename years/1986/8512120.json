 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction injection molding (RIM) is a rapid process for producing               large light weight plastic parts that are used for automobile and               airplane parts among others.  Low viscosity liquid reactants                    (monomers) are mixed and injected into a mold where they reach                  and form a solid crosslinked polymer product.  The two feed                     streams impinge on each other at high velocity and thus achieve                 good mixing.  Reaction proceeds as bulk copolymerization                        resulting in segmented block copolyers.                                                                                                                         The proposed research is aimed at elucidating the fundamental                   chemistry and physics involved in RIM.  The PIs plan to carry out               their work in six stages:  (1) Model the mold filling and curing                steps; (2) Study the chemistry of polyureas and polyurethanes;                  (3) Look at the role of phase separation during polymerization in               the mold; (4) Study the effects of mixing in the mold (5) Obtain                morphology measurements; and (6) Study the bubble motion and                    growth process in RIM due to injected nitrogen gas.  The overall                goal is to build a model for the RIM process.  During the molding               cycle the copolymers must grow into long chains and segregate nto               hard and soft phases.  The work in this project is the analysis                 of the combination of polymerization kinetics and phase                         separation dynamics within a flowing mixing, reacting and heat                  transferring system.                                                                                                                                            The PIs are all very highly thought of and their laboratory is                  one of the best in the country for this work.  The cooperation                  with industry provides an excellent input to help keep the                      project aimed in the proper direction.  A three year Industry                   University Cooperative Research Grant is recommended at $154,682                for FY 86, $174,038 for FY 87, and $164,000 for FY 88.",
