Twenty-five high school biology teachers who need to update and improve         their biological science content and instructional backgrounds will be          invited to attend.                                                                                                                                              The program will consist of three phases.  Phase I will be an Academic          Year Program during 1986-87 and will consist of nine full-day Saturday          meetings.                                                                                                                                                       Phase II will be an eight-week resident Summer Program during June and          August of 1987.  Phase III will be a 1987-88 Academic Year Program of           nine full-day Saturday meetings.                                                                                                                                A two-day meeting of all participants will be held during April of 1988         to allow participants to consult with Institute faculty and to share            teacher-developed instructional materials.  Two or three site visits            will be made to each participant by the faculty.",
