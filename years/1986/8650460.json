 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at Trinity University will fully integrate          nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy into its undergraduate                  curriculum using applications that demonstrate the enormous power and           versatility of this spectroscopic methodology for the examination of            chemical structure and dynamics.  Virtually all students who have the           potential to employ NMR methodologies in their eventual careers will be         exposed to multiple uses of this essential technology.  Development of          this program will be achieved through the purchase of a 60-MHz nuclear          magnetic resonance spectrometer for observation of proton and                   phosphorus-31 nuclei.  This spectrometer will be employed for spectral          observations of organic and organophosphorus compounds, for                     determination of the structure and dynamics of inorganic compounds              having phosphorus ligands, and for investigations of biochemical                processes by phosphorus-31 observation.  Uses of this instrument will           bring together major research developments which are dependent on NMR           spectroscopy, particularly in biochemistry and inorganic chemistry, and         relevant applications of this spectroscopy for inorganic chemistry and          biochemistry in the undergraduate laboratory.",
