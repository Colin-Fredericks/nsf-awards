 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program is designed as an eight-week session for 40 middle/junior           high school (5th-9th grade) teachers.  The basic purposes for the summer        program are:                                                                                                                                                            1.To develop curricular materials:  Inquiry Role Approach               laboratory activities and schoolyard science activities.                                                                                                                2.To improve the academic background of the teachers in                 three areas:  life science, earth science, and physical                         science.                                                                                                                                                        The style of instruction will involve laboratory activities,                    discussions, lectures, and schoolyard field trips.  The Inquiry Role            Approach, a successful teaching strategy utilizing three-member                 laboratory teams, will be the major teaching strategy used for the              physical and earth science areas.  In the life sciences, emphasis will          be placed on schoolyard field trips and the individualization of                laboratory activities.                                                                                                                                          Follow-up activities will include:  a fall and spring meeting following         the workshop to discuss results of training; in-service training events         conducted by participants for science teachers in local schools.  The           college staff will visit each school to continue communications with            middle school teachers.",
