This collaborative has proposed a three-          week summer institute for 84 teachers and a follow-through program              during the school year to create a professional partnership between             classroom teachers and the diverse resources of the museums.                                                                                                    Summer activities will focus on field work, the nature of scientific            inquiry, and hands-on activities which are immediately applicable to the        classroom.  Teachers will participate in field trips which will be              replicable in their own locales, develop topical curricula based on the         particular resources available in the various facilities, and be trained        in the inquiry process of science, be given the opportunity to                  strengthen their content background.  Teachers will have a chance to            choose three of seven topics to pursue each summer.  The topics vary            according to the site offering the workshop.                                                                                                                    Follow-up activities include school visits, an M.I.T.S. Newsletter, and         a teacher support and resource telephone system.",
