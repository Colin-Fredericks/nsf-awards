The Center will offer the following three                  workshops:                                                                                                                                                        oWorkshop I for Secondary School Teachers on the Supervision of High          School Research;                                                                  oWorkshop II for Elementary School Teachers on How to Develop                 Teachers for the Teaching of Science; and                                         oWorkshop III for High School Teachers on How to Develop Teachers for         the Teaching of Chemistry and Physics.                                                                                                                          Workshop I will help teachers develop the necessary skills to serve as          advisors of scientific research projects proposed by students for               presentation at science fairs.  Fifteen secondary school teachers will          attend a three-week session during the summer of 1986.  Two follow-up           sessions, one each semester, will be held to analzye students' research         projects and to constructively help the teacher-advisor bring these             projects to fruition.                                                                                                                                           Workshop II will help elementary teachers develop the content and               methodology necessary to teach and understand hands-on work in the              classroom.  Workshop III will help high school teachers in physics and          chemistry improve their approach to teaching science.                                                                                                           Twenty teachers will attend each workshop at each site.  Follow-up              activities will be provided at four sessions each semester.",
