 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David J. Wilson of Vanderbilt University is a                         recognized leader in the fields of flotation science and colloid                absorption.  These separation methods are established in several                commercial processes including ore treatment and advanced                       wastewater treatment.  The potential and needs from several other               applications are great.                                                                                                                                         Professor Wilson is one of the few people using NMR analysis to                 study the nature and bonding of sorbed species.  The thrust of                  this proposed research will feature several kinds of sulfur                     compounds and certain phosphorous species.  This work will be                   very relevant in the improvement of specificity of the technique.                                                                                               I recommend that Vanderbilt University be given a 2-year                        continuing grant to support Professor Wilson's research in the                  amount of $45,000 for each of the 2 years.",
