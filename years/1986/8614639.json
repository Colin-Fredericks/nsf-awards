 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Design Theory and Methodology program has been in existence for one         of its primary goals is to develop a recognized discipline of design            with an active community of researchers.  This workshop will provide an         avenue for exchange of ideas among this developing community,                   particularly among those who have research grants from the design               theory program and those who have participated in the program through           advisory and review panels.  At the workshop, the current grantees will         make oral presentations that will be followed by smaller group                  discussion focused on research issues in design theory and methodology.         The results of the workship will be disseminated to a wider audience by         publication of a book that contains the presentations plus summaries of         the discussion.",
