 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project is designed to expand and improve the Berea science          education program by providing 30 teachers in grades 1-5/6 schools with         training and support that will enable them to extend elementary science         curriculum to the outdoors.  The Cleveland Metroparks System will offer         their excellent facilities for the program.  Naturalists from the park          staff as well as university science educators will serve as instructors         in this multifaceted program.                                                                                                                                   Teachers will work for two weeks in a workshop setting which will               include upgrading content on basic ecological concepts, discussions of          grade level teaching strategies, and actual field work in the park              system.  Each teacher and a staff member will develop a unit plan for           class field trips. Review sessions will be held in the winter to share          experiences and plans for the spring field trips.  Following the                academic year, the program will be evaluated and the participating              teachers will develop Field Trip Curriculum Guides for each grade level,        1-5.  These guides will enable other school systems to provide adequate         outdoor science education to their students through effective use of            their park systems.",
