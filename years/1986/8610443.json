 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, aids for designers have been analytical techniques that          do not incorporate many of the essential features of the design                 process.  Furthermore, these tools are often based on the assumption            that the designer must make a decision among on a fixed number of               alternatives.  Additional aids are needed for the earlier stages of             design when alternative designs are generated and organized.  Aids will         be created for the preliminary stages of design.  The research is based         on the assumption (1) that expert designers use measurably different            strategies and methods than practitioner designers; and (2) that if             tools could be created that would allow practitioner to use the                 strategies and methods of expert designers, then design practice would          be improved.  The preliminary research will focus on testing these              assumptions.  If these assumptions prove valid, design aids will be             specified and created.",
