 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment request is for acquisition of a double crystal x-ray             spectrometer system that will be used in the evaluation of films and            quantum well structures, such that optimum molecular beam epitaxial             growth techniques can be developed.  At present there is a significant          increase of interest in II-VI semiconductors due to recent success in           growth of films and multiple quantum well structures of those materials         by molecular beam epitaxy.  Applications now envisioned include                 infrared detection, nonlinear optics, blue LED and laser devices, and           flat panel electroluminescent displays.  The research effort described          in this proposal represents a leading program in the study of several           aspects of II-VI epitaxy.  The proposed research deals with fundamental         concepts of heteroepitaxy, the optical and electrical properties of             quantum wells, and the general problems of charged-particle transport           in these potentially important materials.",
