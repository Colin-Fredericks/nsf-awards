 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1957 in the Netherlands, Pierre Marie Van Hiele and his wife Dina Van        Hiele - Geldof postulated a model of the development of geometric               thought. The model, which posits the existence of discrete levels of            geometric thinking and phases of instruction that help students progress        through the levels, explains why many students have difficulty learning         geometry. Since l979 three major research studies have investigated the         validity of the Van Hiele model and its applicability to American               Schools.                                                                                                                                                        The project will convene 30 people (the principal investigators and             senior personnel from previous Van Hiele - based research, scholars from        mathematics education, psychology and computer science, local                   supervisors, and teacher trainers) for a two and one half day conference        at Syracuse University.  The objectives of the conference are (1) to            analyze, synthesize, and evaluate recent research on the Van Hiele              model; (2) to examine alternative models of geometric thinking; (3) to          plan ways to utilize current research results in developing materials           for students and teachers of geometry; and (4) to outline directions for        future research.                                                                                                                                                Conference proceedings will be disseminated via a book of scholarly             papers edited by the conference organizer, via journal articles and             other professional publications, and via workshops and lectures by              conference participants at professional meetings.",
