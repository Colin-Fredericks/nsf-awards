 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paints and surface coatings are suspensions consisting of colloidal             polymer particles dispersed in an aqueous phase (also called latexes).          These suspensions are produced via emulsion polymerization, a                   heterogeneous process in which polymers grow in an oily phase into              which initiators and monomers diffuse from the aqueous phase.  The              suspension is applied to a surface and dries, initially forming a weak          latex film.  After a few days these increase in strength and become             tough and leathery.  In this research, it will be proved that this film         formation occurs because the polymer layers form monolithic colids by           interdiffusion of individual chains across initial bundaries--i.e., the         polymer chains, once freed from the confines of the latex, expand and           try to attain their random coil configurations.  Small-angle neutron            scattering (SANS) is used to look at how these high molecular weight            polymers behave both during their formation and during the setting              stage after drying.  Knowledge of this behavior can then be used to             design other high strength polymers such as liquid crystals.",
