 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Georgia will develop a four-year model program for the        preparation of both middle school science and middle school mathematics         teachers.  The proposed effort involves the development of new content          courses in both science and mathematics, and the development of                 innovative \"parallel\" methods courses for each content course.  Each            science teacher will complete 35 quarter hours of science content and 15        quarter hours of science education; each mathematics teacher will               complete 30 quarter hours of mathematics content and 25 quarter hours of        mathematics education.  Each student will also complete an innovative           course focusing on writing, with special emphasis on mathematics and            science.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed program represents a cooperative effort involving                  scientists, science educators, mathematicians, mathematics educators,           teacher educators, and public school personnel.  This program will              prepare a teacher who has both content knowledge and knowledge of and           skill with methods of teaching middle school children.  Numerous                practicum and clinical field experiences are provided through the               program.",
