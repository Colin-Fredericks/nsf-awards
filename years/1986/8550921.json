 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science education requires a solid research base if long-term gains in          educational quality are to be achieved and consolidated.  This research         base must take account of the content and structure of subject matter           disciplines, the contexts in which science teaching occurs, and the             principles of teaching, learning, and reasoning in scientific domains           that are emerging in research.                                                                                                                                  This project will convene a planning conference on research for science         education that will bring together forty leading professionals who are          experts in (1) subject matter disciplines of science, mathematics and           computer science; (2) the study of classroom teaching and curriculum            development; and (3) the study of cognitive processes of learning,              reasoning and problem solving. Conference participants will assess the          current state of knowledge, examine the prospects for advances based on         currently available resources, and identify activities likely to                significantly increase this knowledge and lead to changes in educational        practices in science education.                                                                                                                                 Project participants will develop plans for further collaboration and           follow-up activities.  In addition, the participants will draw up a             specific set of recommendations and priorities for mathematics, science         and technological education, including suggestions concerning the               relative merits of various research methodologies.                                                                                                              Conference proceedings will be published and distributed to 3,000               members of professional educational research societies, universities,           research centers, funding agencies and other interested parties.                Results of the conference will be discussed in organized symposia and           will be presented at appropriate professional meetings in 1986.",
