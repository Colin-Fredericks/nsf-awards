 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, Luther College will procure a transmission                electron microscope (TEM) so that its Biology Department can expand             course offerings to include a course in the biological applications of          electron microscopy. Students in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology             courses will benefit from a more balanced presentation of structure and         function.  The additional emphasis on cell structure will result in an          improved frame of reference upon which to comprehend cell function.             Histology students will gain a better understanding of cell fine                structure.  This project will upgrade graduate school preparation for           biology majors and produce improved technical employment possibilities          for graduating seniors.  The skill of electron microscopy is a highly           sought-after expertise in research and industry.                                                                                                                The TEM will be used to increase awareness of cellular biology at the           introductory level.  Students in General Biology will receive a closely         supervised first-hand experience of taking electron micrographs which           will serve as lab material for the study of cell fine structure.  The           Chemistry Instrumentation course also will include the electron                 microscope among the instruments studied, and time on the electron              microscope will be made available for student research in geology.  This        instrument thus will benefit the curricula of three of Luther College's         science departments.",
