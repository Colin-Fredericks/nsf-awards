Cooperating community agencies and institutions        will provide a variety of professional growth opportunities for teachers        of science, K-12, and their supervisors and administrators.                                                                                                     The main goals of the project include the improvement of science                education in the schools and revitalization of a mature staff through           professional growth incentives.  The scheduled offerings will help              teachers gain knowledge of science and education content where                  weaknesses and interests have been identified, become aware of the              latest research findings of teaching methodology and learning theory in         order to apply them in their teaching and supervision, and experience           new educational and science technology in research techniques and               skills, such as using the computer as a laboratory instrument.",
