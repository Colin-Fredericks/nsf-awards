 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Information         Center at the University of Colorado.  The Center serves as a research          clearinghouse and provides channels of communication between producers          and users of research on natural hazards.  The Center furthers the              dissemination of information to such potential users as researchers,            practitioners, and government policy makers and managers through                several activities.  An annual hazards research workshop is held at the         University of Colorado with participants from the research and user             communities.  The Center's bi-monthly newsletter, the \"Natural Hazards          Observer,\" highlights results from research projects and hazard                 mitigation programs and is distributed to several thousand persons.             The Center also publishes a monograph series on hazards research                topics.  During the next 12 month period, the Center will continue its          dissemination program.  It will also support modest projects, including         quick-response field investigations, that will produce results that             will be disseminated to relevant researchers.",
