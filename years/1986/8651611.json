 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometry and measurement are closely related topics that are, in current        elementary school curricula, usually taught in separate chapters.  In           reality, however, many measurements involve geometric entities.                 Similarly, many of the properties of geometric figures are derived              through work with measurement. Thus it is reasonable that the geometry          and measurement strands be considered together.  This project will              revise both strands, exploiting the natural connections between geometry        and measurement to their mutual advantage.                                                                                                                      The revisions will be based on theory, the results of previous research,        and expert opinion as presented in the literature.  The theories of the         van Hieles will be a major basis for the revision of the geometry               strand.  The theory of Piaget will likewise form a basis for revision of        the measurement strand. Fourteen prototype units, seven in geometry and         seven in measurement, will be developed.  Calculators and computers will        be used whenever appropriate:  in problem situations, in demonstrations,        in open investigations, in development and exploration of patterns, and         (sometimes) in performing calculations.  The goal is to move mathematics        curricula from static and rote presentations toward dynamic and                 meaningful investigations.",
