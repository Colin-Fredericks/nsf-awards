 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Research Program, the testing of          the full-scale six-story steel structure has now been completed.  This          cooperative program included pseudo-dynamic tests of the full-scale             structure, as well as several coordinated support tests and an analysis         of components and models of the building.  A number of the support              studies are still in progress.  This project will thoroughly                    investigate, analyze, evaluate, and report the results of tests of the          full-scale structure.  The results are investigated in light of current         design practice, especially from a U.S. perspective.  An interim report         will be prepared within 6 months of the start of the study to quickly           disseminate general test results and conclusions.  A more detailed              final report will be prepared at the end.  This report will cover               overall building response and the individual member behavior.  A third          report will contain design implications of the study from a practical           standpoint of seismic design of steel buildings, which will be a                consensus report from all the investigators involved in this                    cooperative program.",
