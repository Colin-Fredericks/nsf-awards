 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saint John's University will purchase a germanium gamma ray detector,           associated nuclear instrumentation electronics and a multi-channel              analyzer, and an active-passive shield in order to conduct high                 resolution, low background spectroscopy experiments.  The requested             equipment, when combined with current Physics and Biology Department            instruments, will provide a complete nuclear detection facility.  The           new systems will increase the resolution of the department's                    spectroscopy equipment to the level of present charged particle systems,        thus enabling students to (a) see modern nuclear detection techniques in        introductory physics and radiation biology courses, (b) do meaningful           laboratory experiments at the intermediate through advanced levels, and         (c) do higher quality nuclear physics-related senior thesis projects.           The new equipment will free the present gamma spectroscopy system for           wider use in the introductory and intermediate labs.  It will help              revitalize and expand the use of some current equipment such as a               neutron generator and PDP11/73 minicomputer. Several new experiments are        planned to familiarize students with the principles of high sensitivity         spectroscopy.",
