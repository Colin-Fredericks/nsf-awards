 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a set of pedagogically sound microcomputer-           based laboratory experiments for beginning physics courses.  In                 addition, it will introduce computer interfacing and control into the           advanced physics laboratories.  To achieve these objectives, Muskingum          will purchase computers with a laser printer, a microcomputer network           for the beginning labs and computer-interfaced measurement instruments          for the advanced labs. The microcomputers in the beginning labs will            include interfaces that turn them into fast, accurate, multipurpose lab         instruments that beginning students can use with ease.  The interfaces          for the advanced lab experiments will allow the students to design and          carry out computer-run experiments.  For both beginning and advanced            labs, the laser printer will provide high quality graphic output from           which the students will extract data.  This project will improve the            physics program by making the labs more up-to-date, more instructive and        more interesting for the students.",
