 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois State University will develop a five-year model program for the        preparation of middle school mathematics teachers.  The proposed effort         involves a major reconceptualization based on the premises that learning        mathematics is a constructive process requiring reflective activity and         that such activity is facilitated by problem-solving situations.                Developmental efforts will include three new mathematics courses, the           modification of two additional mathematics courses, and the modification        of four pedagogical courses.  Teaching methodology in all courses will          reflect the above basic premises.                                                                                                                               The proposed program represents a cooperative effort involving                  mathematicians, mathematics educators, and teacher educators.  Students         will study mathematics content and teaching methodology, be involved in         numerous practicum and clinical experiences, student teaching, and a            well developed set of induction year activities.  The program will              prepare a teacher who is mathematically sound and who is knowledgeable          and skilled in teaching middle school students. This program will stand         as a model for similar types of institutions that have somewhat                 traditional four-year teacher preparation programs.",
