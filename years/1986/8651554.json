 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine existing technologies in an attempt to make           the testing of students' achievement in biology and the life sciences           precise and efficient.  The technologies involved include microcomputer,        interactive videodisc, CD-ROM containing data bases of questions and            instructional materials, graphics, shared disks and printers, and               adaptive testing.  The tools developed under the project are expected to        ease the administration and bookkeeping burdens associated with the             creation, administration and scoring of high school science assessment          and diagnostic tests and to provide test results with prescriptions to          text-based curricula for remediation and enrichment.  Diagnostic tests          with automated routing to high quality videodisc-based instruction will         also be provided.  The prototype to be developed and tested focuses on          biology and life sciences in grade 7-12.  Once the concept is proven,           WICAT is in a position to readily extend the system to high school              courses in physics, chemistry and general science.                                                                                                              The main objective of this project is to test the validity of the               adaptive testing approach in science to determine if it can yield time          improvements of 50% to 70% as obtained in mathematics.                                                                                                          The independent evaluation is expected to show, in addition to decreased        testing time, improved teacher-made tests and improved student attitudes        toward science.  Results will be disseminated through publications and          at regional and national conferences of science teachers and school             board members.",
