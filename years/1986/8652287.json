 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on accumulating evidence of instructional effectiveness from              research in small individual studies and the clear potential of new             technological developments, many national boards and commissions have           recently recommended exploring the use of technology to improve American        education. This proposal aims to assist state and federal agencies              concerned with educational improvements to evaluate the potential of            technology to influence directly the solution of problems of American           education, using large scale demonstration in typical educational               settings.  A planning framework will be developed to assist in the              selection of suitable demonstrations.  Some model demonstrations that           meet the criteria of the planning framework will be roughed out.  These         rough designs will be reviewed by educational policy makers, experts,           and industry and foundation officials at an invited conference.                                                                                                 This activity aims at identifying applications of technology that can           make a prima facie difference in American education.  A report of the           conference will include a discussion of the planning framework, and a           description and critique of the model demonstrations.",
