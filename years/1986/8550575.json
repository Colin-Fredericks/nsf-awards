 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Red Mountain Museum of Birmingham Alabama will offer an academic-           year, in-service, instructional program for teachers of 9th grade               physical science.  The Museum will be the site of this project and will         simulate the classroom and the type of laboratory facilities found in           the schools.  The program is intended to reduce the anxiety of the              teacher, raise self-confidence, and improve laboratory skills, subject          matter competence, and mathematical skills.                                                                                                                     The Education Department of Red Mountain Museum, all certified teachers,        have designed this project based on a teacher survey so that                    participants will meet once a week for two-and one-half hours during the        academic year.  The time will be split between lecture and hands-on             activities that will directly prepare the teachers for the activities           prescribed by the new syllabus for physical science.                                                                                                            An excellent evaluation component of the project provides for the               observation of each participating teacher at least four times during the        school year. Evaluative instruments will assess the laboratory work of          the teachers and of their students as well as their attitudes toward            science.",
