 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide enhancement and professional development for          approximately 40 middle school teachers from public and private school          systems in the metropolitan Detroit area (Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb            Counties), for a five-week summer workshop, a semester of follow-up             sessions, and visitations to classrooms.  Further, it proposes to make          available the materials developed during the workshop to middle school          teachers across the Nation through articles outlining the model and             methods used in the project.                                                                                                                                    One of the major objectives of this proposal will be to conduct a               workshop that will improve the knowledge of chemistry of middle school          teachers and also students.  Modern science topics appropriate for              middle school students; how chemistry concepts and principals can be            applied to students' personal lives and career choices; and societal            issues and technology will be the foci of the workshop.  Emphasis will          be placed on the development of inquiry process and problem-solving             skills.",
