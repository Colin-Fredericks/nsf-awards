 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer program was developed for multiparticle size fluidization,           and some experimental data on segregation were also already obtained            using x-ray and x-ray densitometers.  One of the objectives of the              study is to apply the single-size hydrodynamic model of fluidization to         predict the shapes and sizes of bubbles in large-scale, fluid-bed               reactors; in reactors under a high pressure; and in fluid-bed                   combustors containing tubes.  A second objective is to complete the             development of a hydrodynamic model for three-phase fluidization with           an application to bioreactors.  These objectives will be accomplished           by making calculations on a supercomputer with several models by                comparing the computations to literature data and to several                    fundamental experiments.  Whenever possible, computer-generated movies          will be compared to movies of experiments.",
