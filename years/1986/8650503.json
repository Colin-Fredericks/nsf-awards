 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is two-fold:  1)  to provide undergraduates           with improved ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometric capabilities for           experimentation in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced             laboratory courses and research projects, including capability for              conducting kinetics experiments, and 2)  to provide computer hardware           and software for students to gain experience with computer interfacing          for laboratory instrument control and data acquisition.  An integrated,         multipurpose system consisting of a spectrophotometer, accessories,             microcomputer system, and associated software will be used by                   undergraduate students in upper-level chemistry courses serving                 chemistry, biology, and medical technology majors.  Through this project        Bethune-Cookman College, an historically Black institution, will                continue its significant contribution to science education of minority          students.",
