 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to assist the Biology Department at Saint           Mary's College to strengthen undergraduate laboratory instruction in            cellular and molecular biology.  The ultracentrifuge and liquid                 scintillation counter purchased through the project will have a major           impact upon the improvement of laboratory work involving the                    preparation, use, and analysis of subcellular organelles, viral                 particles, and such macromolecules as DNA, RNA, and proteins.                                                                                                   The ultracentrifuge has become an essential tool in laboratories doing          preparative work with DNA and RNA, or with subcellular fractions such as        ribosomes, mitochondria, and viruses.  The scintillation counter is used        in conjunction with the ultracentrifuge to quantify the incorporation of        radioisotopes into these fractions.  Experimental work with these two           instruments is now basic to advances in a broad range of scientific             fields.  It is important that students become familiar with the use of          such modern instrumentation and thereby gain an appreciation of current         research strategies in cellular and molecular biology.                                                                                                          As St. Mary's moves to modernize and strengthen the biology curriculum,         more emphasis is being placed on laboratory experience in cellular and          molecular biology--one of the core areas in the department.  Older              courses in Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology all will benefit        greatly from the acquisition of an ultracentrifuge and liquid                   scintillation counter--instruments essential for the new course in              Molecular Biology and for more sophisticated student research projects.         They will allow significantly improved \"hands-on\" laboratory experience         for undergraduate biology majors.",
