 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to find a new class of solvents with             similar thermodynamic properties to those of fluids at their gas-liquid         critical point.  The goal of the present effort is to confirm the               theoretical predictions that binary mixtures have enhanced selectivity          for dissolving various compounds.  Supercritical extraction processes           are receiving wide interest; however, the number of liquids which have          critical points at both low temperatures and pressures is limited.  It          is intended to use Thin Layer Chromatographic plates (TLC) as the               stationary phase and to use various immiscible solvent mixtures showing         a CST point as a mobile phase.  The difference in the rates of mobility         of various compounds, near and far away from the CST point, will be             used as a measure of solubility.  It is especially intended to check if         binary mixtures of optically active compounds have enhanced selectivity         near the CST for the components of a racemic mixture.",
