The exhibition will, for the first time, offer museum                visitors a first hand opportunity to explore the tools, methods, and            concepts of psychology in such areas as thinking and feeling, dreaming          and sleeping, perceiving and communicating. The exhibition will travel          to eight museums over 30 months through the ASTC traveling exhibition           service and will reach over a million visitors.                                                                                                                 A wide selection of additional materials and resources such as films,           seminars, lectures and workshops will be offered to the participating           museums to extend the impact of the exhibition.  Plans of the exhibits          will be made available to other museums.  NSF support  represents less          than 50% of the total cost of the project.",
