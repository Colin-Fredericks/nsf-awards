 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project is a joint venture of the Baltimore          City Public Schools and the Johns Hopkins University School of                  Continuing Studies.  The project involves 40 middle school and 10 high          school teachers in activities to increase the application of computer           technology in the science classrooms of the Baltimore City schools.  It         is an outgrowth of a successful pilot project involving high school             science teachers during 1986.  The target population contains a high            percentage of minority and disadvantaged students.                                                                                                              Two groups of 20 middle school science teachers will receive 12 days of         instruction in computer awareness, operating procedures, word                   processing, database and spreadsheet use, software evaluation, labortory        interfacing, programming, and individual project development.  Teachers         will have ample opportunity to \"practice with feedback\" and will receive        follow-up coaching by a support coordinator and leader teachers after           the training program. Leadership training will be provided to 10 high           school and 10 middle school teachers who will provide peer support in           the school setting.  In addition, 15 leader teachers will develop a             series of model science lessons that integrate computer technology into         the present curriculum during a five-week summer session.  Project staff        from Johns Hopkins will also provide continuing assistance to the               project teachers.  Formal associations of the teachers to continue the          work of the project will be established.                                                                                                                        Participants will be selected in pairs from middle schools that feed the        high schools involved in the pilot project.  Criteria have been                 established for the selection of the middle school trainees, the leader         teachers, and the curriuclum developers.",
