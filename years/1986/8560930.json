 "awd_abstract_narration": "In computer-aided design (CAD) systems that have been installed, the            problem of converting existing paper drawings into an equivalent                electronically-stored form within the CAD system has proven difficult           to resolve.  CAD systems would be much more effective if there existed          an automatic method to convert the many existing drawings into                  electronic forms, in which the information on the original drawings was         not lost.  Research is in progress to create a system that would                digitize a drawing then interpret the information stored on the                 drawing.  A computerized expert system will be created to perform this          task.  For each application field, the expert system will use rules and         knowledge about drawings in that particular field to translate the data         into a usable form.  Vexcel strategies will be developed that will              result in an acceptable throughput rate at an acceptable error                  rate--both essential requirements for any commercial system.",
