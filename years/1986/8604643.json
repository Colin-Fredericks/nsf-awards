The research emphasis is the development of intelligent decision-making         framework and knowledge-based expert system for design and                      manufacturing tasks.  AI techniques are combined with conventional              problem-solving methods to develop intelligent systems in which                 qualitative reasoning can be incorporated with quantitative skills.             The long term goal is to design a computer-based framework by which             different types of problem-solving paradigms and different sources of           knowledge can be utilized for intelligent decision-making of                    engineering tasks.",
