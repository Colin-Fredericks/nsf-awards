 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will increase the knowledge of science of K-6 teachers,            improve the teachers' knowledge of the methodology associated with              teaching science, explore recent science-related societal issues, and           improve the ability to teach science to exceptional students (gifted and        talented, bilingual, and physically disabled).  The activities for              elementary school teachers will be accompanied by in-service activities         for principals, directed toward a quality K-6 science program and the           role of the principal in developing and implementing the program.                                                                                               Three different, but related, programs will be offered.  Fifty                  elementary school teachers will be selected for two of the programs.            Twenty-five from within commuting distance of Lubbock will attend               sessions on the Texas Tech University campus one night a week during the        1986-87 academic year and one six-week summer session in 1987.  The             other 25 participants, living beyond commuting distance, will attend            corresponding sessions at Lamesa.                                                                                                                               Principals will participate in the third program consisting of two all-         day workshops conducted in October and November of 1986.  The objectives        and description of an in-service program for teachers, the use of               assessment instruments to evaluate K-6 science programs, and the role of        principals as leaders in curriculum development will be presented.                                                                                              All sessions will include special programs and techniques to assist             project participants in helping their colleagues in planning and                teaching science. Selected teachers will meet with principals to                formulate staff development strategies and plans.  All activities will          be based on the assumption that science in grades K-6 can be taught             without elaborate equipment and supplies.",
