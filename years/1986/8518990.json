 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a strong need for the development of innovative processing             methods to ensure a strong and competitive technological base for the           steel industry in the future.  The liquid oxysulfide phase in the               iron-oxygen-sulfur system could function as a smelting medium for the           production of metallic iron from oxidic and sulfidic ores.                      Potentially, the smelting process could be carried out at temperatures          that are several hundred degrees below those in the blast furnace               hearth and in steelmaking furnaces.  The technology that could be based         on oxysulfide smelting could have many advantages, some of which are            high volumetric throughput, conservation of energy, and production of a         very pure raw material for subsequent processing into steels.  It is            possible that the pure iron product might lead to completely new kind           of steels, and eventually new methods of processing steels.  A                  physic-chemical study will be undertaken of the thermodynamics and              kinetics of reactions and processes that would be of generic importance         in the development of possible methods for the bath reduction and               smelting of iron ores in which the bath would be liquid oxysulfide              phase in the Fe-O-S system.",
