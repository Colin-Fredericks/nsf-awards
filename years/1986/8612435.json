 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to  provide undergraduate engineering students with            both basic principles and practical aspects of material testing and to          explore avenues for improved cooperation between the university and             industry.  The university will teach the basic principles of the                subject, while an industrial laboratory will provide the practical              aspects of materials testing.  The course consists of one semester              credit laboratory course, which has about 13 3-hour periods.  Seven of          13 periods are supervised by the faculty and staff of the university.           In the other four periods, the students go to the industrial                    laboratories to see the actual commercial testings, state-of-the-art            equipment, and the demonstration of special testing techniques.  The            remaining periods of the course are used for special lectures given             either by engineers from laboratories on the testing projects that              could not be scheduled for student observation, or by faculty members           who are involved in experimental research projects.  All activities             that are performed by industrial laboratories are to be videotaped;             these tapes will be made  available for other students who will take            the course in the future.",
