 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop video, computer, and print materials that will        enhance the teaching of geometry in secondary schools.  The central             medium will be broadcast-quality videotapes, which will consist of              computer generated animation accompanied by narration and some text.            Workbooks will allow the video materials to be used either for classroom        instruction or for independent study.  Related computer programs,               together with high quality documentation, will also be developed,               allowing students to explore geometric concepts interactively.                                                                                                  A useful byproduct of the project will be a \"geometer's sketch pad\", a          program that will enable geometers working with inexpensive                     microcomputers to sketch geometric figures in two and three dimensions          and to apply geometric transformations that will permit visualization           from different perspectives.  This program will be used by the project          staff for prototyping animation sequences.  It will also be of interest         to other mathematicians and will be appropriate as an instructional tool        for use with gifted students.",
