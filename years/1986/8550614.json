 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research efforts in some areas of mathematics education have developed          to a point where consensus is needed to establish a conceptual framework        to guide future inquiry.  The Research Advisory Committee of the                National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has identified four such            areas: teaching and learning of middle school number concepts, effective        mathematics teaching, the teaching and learning of algebra, and the             teaching and evaluation of problem solving.                                                                                                                     The proposed project will establish working groups in these areas.  Each        of the four groups will meet for a four day conference to consider the          significant issues in the area.  Each conference will feature                   presentations by authors of invited papers, small group discussion              sessions, and plenary sessions.  The purposes of these conferences are          to synthesize the current knowledge base in each area, identify                 significant directions for future research, and develop collegial               research groups.  Four monographs, one from each working group                  conference, will disseminate invited papers, conference proceedings, and        the research agendas established by the conference participants.  A             fifth monograph will contain a variety of viewpoints on the proceedings         and resulting agendas through retrospective papers by members of the            project advisory council.",
