It will study the                   underlying sources of maintenance downtime and fault diagnosis                  difficulty in computer-integrated production systems.  The project has          two components.  The first involves collecting and analyzing                    plant-based field data on the amount of downtime associated with                various kinds of failures, including information on frequency of                failures and the amount of downtime per failue.  The second component           is an experimental study to understand what makes these failures                difficult to diagnose.  The experimental study will utilize                     professional troubleshooters to diagnose faults in a computer-based             model of the process control of a manufacturing cell.",
