 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an unsolicited proposal for the Council of Chief State School           Officers (CCSSO) to work with state education agencies to develop better        indicators of precollege education in math and science.  An inventory           will be conducted in the states to identify the information they now            collect on the dimensions and quality of math and science education             using the framework being developed for such indicators by the National         Research Council, the RAND Corporation, and the University of Wisconsin.        These indicator concepts and models will be applied to a data-collection        \"shuttle\" process to describe how each state defines and collects such          information.                                                                                                                                                    The project will work to meet the complementary needs for a system of           indicators in math/science education that serves program managers and           policy-makers at both the state and national levels.  The project               capitalizes on the role states are playing in educational monitoring and        reform, while exercising national leadership to bring about quality,            comprehensiveness, and comparability in the data they collect and use.",
