 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory project will study the intuitive notions of light and          vision that are held by children ages 10-14.  A novel feature of this           work is that it takes place in a science museum and uses interactive            exhibits as the tasks that mediate the interviews with the children.            The project is expected to yield results that are novel and that                complement those obtained from work done in the school setting.  The            specific aims are: (1) to expand the existent empirical data on the             explanations given by children by exploring the subject matter area of          optics-shadow-formation, images and color; (2) to determine the nature          of tasks, activities and experiences that enhance conceptual                    understanding and aid the child's development of scientifically valid           concepts; (3) to determine what overall organizing principles are most          useful for the researcher and for the teacher.                                                                                                                  The project will begin to explore the practical applications of this            research for (1) exhibit design and, by extension, classroom activities;        (2) the use of hands-on museums for exhibit-based learning and teaching;        (3) strategies for enhancing concept acquisition that can be used for           curriculum development and teacher education in both formal and informal        settings.",
