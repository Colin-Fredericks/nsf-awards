 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Biotechnology Workshop for Teachers\" will provide 60 biology,              chemistry and general science precollege teachers an opportunity to             study the basic principles of biotechnology as developed in the past ten        years.  Specifically this will build the confidence of the participant          teachers in the area of biotechnology by updating their knowledge               through \"hands-on\" laboratory participation, providing opportunities to         develop laboratory/lecture materials, and learning to use specially             prepared molecular biology kits that will be made available to their            high school students.  The six-week summer workshop will be held at             Georgetown University and will include opportunities for independent            research and informal discussions on data analysis and experimental             design.                                                                                                                                                         The long term goals of this project are first to initiate the training          of 60 high school teachers within a 50-mile radius of the Washington, DC        Metropolitan area and later to expand this program over a wider area for        a broader impact. Another major goal is to develop, in conjunction with         private industry, the necessary reagents critical to study areas of             biotechnology.                                                                                                                                                  Teachers who show promise of being catalytic focal points in their              respective school systems and of having the skills to incorporate the           materials in the classrooms and school districts will be selected for           this workshop.  Follow-up and evaluation procedures by the PI will              continue to provide help for the teachers within their classrooms and in        their roles as resource persons.",
