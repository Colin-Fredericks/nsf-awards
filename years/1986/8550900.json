 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 30 Montana mathematics                 teachers, grades 7-12, who will be selected on the basis of geographic          distribution and leadership ability to become regional mathematics              teachers and present workshops throughout the state.                                                                                                            The IMPACT project's main goal is to develop a leadership program for           mathematics teachers (7-12) that will result in a comprehensive                 statewide in-service program for mathematics teachers in these grades.          Two two-year summer institutes featuring mathematics content and the use        of computers as a regular component of the mathematics curriculum will          be conducted.  A carefully selected set of computer software                    specifically related to those topics ordinarily found in the 7-12               mathematics curriculum will be evaluated and organized for classroom            use.  Thirty teachers will be trained and 30 new teachers will be added         the second year.  These qualified leaders have the potential to impact          5000-8000 workshop participants over a five year period, thereby                covering most of the state.  This program will provide an opportunity           for teachers who are expected to teach all 7-12 mathematics to learn            about and use software at both the junior and senior high school levels.        It has a wide cross-section of involvement including the private sector,        the Office of Public Instruction, local schools, the State University           system, and professional organizations.",
