 "awd_abstract_narration": "The middle-school and high-school years are a period of change and              crystalization in terms of life goals, disciplinary and course                  preferences, and social and political attitudes.  The literature                provides a number of cross-sectional descriptions and models concerning         cognitive and attitudinal development during adolescence and young              adulthood, but there are no longitudinal data available to study these          processes.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed longitudinal study will  examine the (1) development of            interest in science and mathematics, (2) the growth of scientific               literacy, (3) the development of attentiveness to science and technology        issues, and (4) the attraction to careers in science and engineering            among two national cohorts of adolescents and young adults.  One cohort         will begin with a national sample of 3,000 seventh graders and follow           them through the 10th grade.  The second cohort will begin with a               national sample of 3,000 10th graders and follow them for the next four         years through the first full year after high school.  Data will be              collected from students, teachers, counselors, principals, and parents.                                                                                         A purposive sample of two or three school districts with exemplary              elementary school science and mathematics education programs will be            selected and comparable data will be collected in these districts.                                                                                              The analysis will consist of a series of expanding multivariate                 developmental models that will seek to understand cognitive and                 attitudinal growth and change in the context of family, school, and peer        influences.  Each wave of data collection will provide an opportunity to        examine cognitive and attitudinal change measures in an increasingly            rich context of previous measures.  Periodic reports will be issued with        each cycle of data collection and the data will be made available to            other scholars on a timely basis.                                                                                                                               The first phase of the project, being funded at this time, provides             approximately 15 months for instrument development and pilot testing,           for sample selection, for monitor selection and training, and for               working with the research advisory committee.",
