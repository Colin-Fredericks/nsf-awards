 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be designed to answer three research questions:  1)           what are effective strategies at the state level that will improve              science curriculum content through the use and articulation of state            curriculum standards, the selection of instructional materials and              student assessment; 2) under what conditions does state action on               curriculum standards, instructional materials and assessment work               effectively to support improved curriculum content in schools and               districts; and 3) how do these strategies define the role and                   responsibility of the state education agency in improving the quality of        science curriculum.                                                                                                                                             Three states will be studied to identify effective strategies and make          comparisons among them for their varying degrees of state initiatives in        curriculum and instructional reform and assessment.  Five local school          districts within each of the three states will be studied to develop a          better picture of how state and local strategies are implemented in             schools.  In addition, two surveys will be conducted to identify                existing information on current policies in all 50 states that are              designed to upgrade science and mathematics curriculum and assessment;          and to identify existing curriculum and assessment practices and state          roles in all districts within the three states selected for in-depth            analysis.  These two survey results will be used to select the three            states and 15 local districts that will be included in the study.               Districts will be selected to reflect varying levels of success on the          state's science assessment, SES and size.  They will also be selected           based on the extent to which they are implementing state strategies             based on the State Education Agency recommendations as reflected in the         district survey findings.                                                                                                                                       A five member advisory committee comprised of a nationally recognized           academic science educator, two state education agency science                   supervisors, a representative of a regional educational laboratory, and         a state assessment director, will be formed to guide the development of         the field researcher's strategy and to select the states and districts          that will form the basis of the study.",
