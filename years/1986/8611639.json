 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millimeter wave receivers incorporating the highest quality Schottky            barrier diodes presently utilize whisker contacted devices.  The advent         of millimeter wave integrated circuitry and planar array receivers              underscores the requirement of a whiskerless, planar Schottky barrier           device.  At present, commercial manufacturere have produced whiskerless         devices which have far less than optimum electrical characteristics.            The object of this proposed research is to carry out work toward a              whiskerless Schottky barrier mixer diode for use at and above l00 GHz           signal frequency which will have electrical characteristics, including          parasitic element values, as near as possible to those theoretically            predicted.  This research program will consist of a joint effort                between the University of Virginia's Semiconductor Device Laboratory            and the Fort Monmouth Electronic Technology and Devices Laboratory.  It         will involve optimization of device design and fabrication technology           utilizing the MBE, ion implantation, and electron beam mask generation          facilities at Fort Monmouth and the existing processing technologies            and processing equipment at the University of Virginia.  This project           will involve one Ph.D. student for a period of one year.",
