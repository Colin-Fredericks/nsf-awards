 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide the Department of Biology at the College of           St. Catherine with equipment for the in vitro growth, quantification and        observation of higher eucaryotic cells.  Acquisition of this equipment          will allow them to:  (1) expand the scope of previous laboratory                exercises in Immunology, Microbiology, Genetics and Physiology to               include areas such as animal virology, cellular immunology and somatic          cell genetics; (2) provide students with hands-on experience with modern        biotechnological equipment; and (3) encourage student research projects.        The bulk of the equipment requested is for cell culture work.  This             includes two tissue culture hoods, two inverted phase contrast                  microscopes, a carbon dioxide incubator and a liquid nitrogen cell              storage freezer.  Additionally, two fluorescent microscopes will                facilitate observation of immunofluorescently stained cells.  The               project will take advantage of the training of two recently appointed           faculty members who, with this equipment, will be able to introduce             important new modern biological work into the curriculum, thus advancing        this Department's already strong record for supporting the education of         women in science.",
