 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the National Information Service for Earthquake                  Engineering (NISEE) is to disseminate information on earthquake                 engineering and related fields to practicing engineers, researchers,            government agencies, and the general public.  In addition to the                component of NISEE at the University of California, Berkeley, there is          also a unit of NISEE at the California Instutute of Technology.  The            NISEE program at the University of California, Berkeley, includes three         main activities:  operations of a reference and lending library,                publication of the Abstract Journal in Earthquake Engineering, and              distribution of computer programs for use in earthquake research and            design.  The library consists of such items as research reports,                monographs, technical journals, and films.  The Abstract Journal                provides a survey of world literature in the field.  The computer               programs have assisted professional engineers by enabling them to apply         current research to solve design problems.  NISEE intends to take               advantage of new information technologies to increase the efficiency of         current operations, broaden the spectrum of services provided, and              expand the audience served.",
