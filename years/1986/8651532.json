 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deliver in-service training to 30 junior and senior           high school teachers.  The project hypothesizes the creation of an              environmental center in an environmentally-sensitve wetland along Lake          Ontario.  The data gleaned from the project will aid in planning                programs for a proposed new environmental center.                                                                                                               Participants will attend a five-week summer course beginning in July of         1987.  During this segment of the program, participants will learn how          to evaluate the environmental consequences of the development.                  Subsequently, a series of five monthly curricular workshops during the          following academic year will use the summer experience to create                suitable curricular modules for the participating schools.  The cycle of        a summer course and five curricular workshops will be repeated the              following year with a new and different group of teachers.  During the          summer institute, each school will be asked to recommend student                \"colleagues\" to work with teacher in field collection and identification        projects.",
