 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Independent Education, Inc., will sponsor a pilot             program for the continuing education of 28 teachers from 14 neighborhood        independent schools serving minority students.  These schools are               located primarily in central cities of nine eastern, middle Atlantic,           and southern states.                                                                                                                                            This project addresses the need for upgrading teaching skills and               increasing the scope of precollege mathematics curricula.  The selected         teachers from grades 5-8 will be given the opportunity to increase their        knowledge of appropriate mathematics content, develop innovative                mathematics problem-solving strategies through the use of hands-on              curriculum, develop and reinforce their own critical thinking skills,           and improve their potential for good classroom management.  This program        will be carried out during a two-week summer seminar held at American           University, Washington, DC.                                                                                                                                     Follow-up will include two on-site visits by project staff to each              school. Since this is a pilot project, extensive evaluative processes           will be carried out immediately following the summer program and during         the school year. Dissemination in schools unable to participate will be         through the use of distribution of videotapes of lectures and work              sessions of the summer seminar.",
