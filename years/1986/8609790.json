 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the development of new design                      methodologies for stabilizing uncertain systems.  This will be achieved         by effectively exploiting a priori knowledge of the structure of the            uncertainties.  Such information is often available in the detailed             description of mechanical systems; e.g., aircraft.  The research                objectives include exploiting structure in three major areas:  (1) In           the design of observers.  (ii) In designing state feedback controls via         a special Riccati equation.  (iii) In the stability analysis of                 families of (characteristic) polynomials.  Lyapunov theory will be the          major technical tool.  Indeed, existing robustness criteria use                 Lyapunov theory either directly or indirectly.  In the stability                analysis of polynomials the celebrated results of Kharitonov will be            invoked.  It is expected that this research will help to establish a            unified approach to stabilizing uncertain systems.  The approach will           avoid conservative robust designs (a trait of those existing methods            which ignore available structural information) and synthesize                   stabilizing feedback controls.  In contrast, many modern approaches             take the control as given data and provide a robustness estimate for            the closed loop system.",
