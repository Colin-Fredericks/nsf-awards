 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and                 professional development experiences for 120 exemplary mathematics              teachers from the western Massachusetts and northwestern Connecticut            area.  Both elementary and secondary mathematics teachers will be               involved.  The overall goals of the multiyear project involve the               updating and deepening of the participants' mathematical backgrounds and        teaching methodologies with emphasis upon problematic and constructivist        perspectives, the networking of the staff and participants through              regular school visitations and group workshops, the conduct of frequent         in-service helping and sharing sessions by the participants in their            schools, the dissemination of the project materials and results, and the        investigation of the modelistic approach within a carefully planned             documentation, assessment and evaluation effort.                                                                                                                The teacher enhancement model is organized into five stages of                  leadership development.  In the first stage (a two-week summer workshop)        teachers intensely study mathematical problem solving and constructive          teacher practices.  In stage two (academic year follow-up) teachers             apply and practice new techniques and receive coaching guidance in              weekly classroom visits by the ELM Project staff.  Stage three involves         a second two-week summer advanced workshop which deepens and reinforces         their experiences and begins their training for conducting in-service           work with their peers.  In stage four (second academic year follow-up)          the advanced leadership teachers and ELM Project staff plan and conduct         in-service workshops for school colleagues.  At stage five the                  leadership teachers conduct workshops with minimal guidance from project        staff.",
