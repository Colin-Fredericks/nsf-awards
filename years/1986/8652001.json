 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will increase the science and the            teaching competence of 80 public and private school teachers of grades          K-5 in the Fort Wayne area.  The project's principal goals include              developing and assessing a model for increasing the quality and quantity        of science taught by all regular elementary school teachers within a            school district.  The teacher education will occur within an                    investigative context; the teachers will receive support in consultation        while they incorporate investigative science activities in their own            classrooms; subsequently the lead teachers will work with the other             teachers within their buildings and reach into all classrooms in the 36         elementary schools in the Fort Wayne community school system and in the         Lutheran private school system.  A team of 2 excellent teachers, one            from grades K-3 and one from grades 4-5, will serve as catalysts for the        improvement of science teaching within each school.                                                                                                             The project is based upon a needs assessment, pilot study, and                  recommendations from the science education literature.  The model               includes significant cost sharing and partnerships with the cooperating         school district, the university, and local industry.  The leadership            team includes scientists, science educators, and school administrators.         The model includes the development and support of plans and programs            designed to sustain the results of this project well beyond the period          of funding from NSF.  Plans are also underway for thorough documentation        and the dissemination of results.  The project includes summer                  activities involving academic work in science and in curriculum                 development and a series of activities throughout the academic year that        build upon these summer activities.  The model also includes special            workshops conducted for administrators working with the teachers in             their schools.",
