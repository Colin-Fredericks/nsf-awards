 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of optics will be combined with modern physics to prepare          students for a technology that increasingly utilizes lasers and opto-           electronics.  This emphasis will be expanded in introductory courses,           and a new, upper-level optics, light, and modern physics laboratory will        be established.  Experiments have been designed and successfully tested         which combine laser light, modern physics, fiber optics, and computer           interfacing.  The department will purchase optical tables and lasers for        making holographic and other interferometric measurements, optical fiber        equipment for measuring the characteristics of light transmission, and          equipment for computer interfacing.  These experiments will be                  coordinated with experiments in modern physics for which little                 additional equipment is required.  Simpler experiments using this               equipment will be introduced into the introductory courses.  The                treatment of optics as a component of modern physics will increase the          students' understanding of optical phenomena, especially those involving        quantum mechanical concepts, and prepare them for a technology that uses        electronics to interface lasers.",
