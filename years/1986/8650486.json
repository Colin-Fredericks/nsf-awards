 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to make a significant contribution to          improving Wellesley's undergraduate Physiology laboratory through the           acquisition of electronic recording and monitoring equipment that will          allow the incorporation of computer-based data collection and analysis          techniques.  The instruments to be acquired, when interfaced with               general purpose microcomputers currently available in the department,           will provide invaluable experience with modern physiological research           techniques, as exemplified by thirteen already-developed student                exercises and by others yet to be prepared.                                                                                                                     Successful laboratory exercises will be collected into a manual for             dissemination to other institutions.  In addition, the equipment will           allow the Wellesley faculty to increase opportunities for independent           research by undergraduate students in the department, and to enhance the        honors research program.  This project ultimately is aimed at increasing        the number and improving the educational experience of women who choose         careers as professionals in the biomedical and allied life sciences.            The project's impact at Wellesley will be felt at once; a broader               national impact also may be gained.",
