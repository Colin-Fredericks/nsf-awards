 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Chicago School Mathematics Project is in the process          of developing and implementing in the classroom a comprehensive K-12            program designed to upgrade mathematics education for all elementary            school students and for the majority of secondary school students who           are in the middle achievement range.  An up-to-date curriculum,                 emphasizing problem solving and applications, is being written and              tested in Chicago area schools.  In its elementary (K-6) component, the         project seeks to reduce the amount of time devoted to teaching                  computational skills, introduce more geometry and statistics, and use           calculator arithmetic to aid instruction and expand the teaching of             applications of mathematics.                                                                                                                                    Initial funding for the project has been provided by the Amoco                  Foundation. Additional funding, to assist in supporting the secondary           component, has been provided by the Carnegie Foundation.  NSF funding           will help support the elementary component.                                                                                                                     The project will field test the elementary school mathematics materials         that are being developed, including calculator workbooks, problem               solving workbooks, and workcards designed to guide students in the              independent use of a variety of manipulatives.  It will develop a model         for the teacher training necessary to assure successful use of the              developed materials.  The model will focus on training generalist               teachers for grades K-3 and specialist teachers for grades 4-6.  A              teacher training package will be prepared for use by mathematics                supervisors, coordinators, and others who wish to adopt the training            program.",
