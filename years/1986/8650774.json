These experiments will improve the training of upper-            division biology majors in several different sub-disciplines: (1)  it           will permit the investigation of the effects of temperature, light              levels, day length, and humidity on many aspects of plant metabolism,           growth and development (Plant Physiology); (2)  by providing homogeneous        environments for plant breeding studies, it will allow the measurement          of heritabilities of quantifiable characters, and hence the study of the        effects of natural and artificial selection on polygenic traits                 (Evolutionary Biology); (3)  by providing homogeneous environments, it          will facilitate experimental investigations of the effects of                   competition among plants (Ecology).  These experiments will train               undergraduate students in techniques valuable not only in pure research,        but also in applied fields such as agriculture, and will help to                generate interest in and excitement about the biology of plants.",
