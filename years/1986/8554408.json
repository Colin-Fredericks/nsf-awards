 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of Gallaudet                 University will sponsor the 1986-1988 Summer Institute in Mathematics           and Computer Science for Elementary and Secondary Teachers of Hearing           Impaired Persons.  One hundred and ten elementary and secondary teachers        of the hearing impaired from various schools across the country will            come to Gallaudet for a six-week workshop in each of three years.               Fifteen elementary school teachers and fifteen secondary teachers who           will be selected to participate in year one will have the opportunity to        choose courses in mathematics, computer literacy, geometry and advanced         algebra.  Nine credits will be awarded for the completion of these              courses which will include training in the basic concepts of                    mathematics, computer programming and applications and methodology and          application of classroom teaching skills.                                                                                                                       The project director will be visiting the schools during the school year        to observe and follow-up the progress of the teachers in their                  classrooms.  He will offer the resources of the University as well as           the project staff to help the teachers improve their mathematics                teaching.",
