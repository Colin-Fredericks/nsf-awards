 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is the logical extension of this PI's previous                work on analyzing multiplicity features in nonlinear chemically                 reacting systems.  His previous work dealt with lumped parameter                systems whereas in this project he is planning to use recently                  developed mathematical techniques to look at more complex                       distributed parameter problems.                                                                                                                                 Problems associated with steady-state multiplicity are                          encountered mainly in catalytic reactors used to carry out                      exothermic chemical reactions.  The efficient utilization,                      operation and control of industrial reactors requires knowledge                 of all their behavioral features, such as all the possible steady               states.  The proposed analysis will provide a systematic approach               to finding all the qualitative features of distributed parameter                systems in which the interaction between the dispersion and                     chemical kinetics may lead to multiple steady state.  This could                guide the experimentalist in finding new and more profitable                    states and eneable the rational development or more reliable and                safe control and start-up policies.  The methodology developed in               this work will be useful also in other areas in which the                       interaction between diffusion and chemical kinetics can lead to                 steady-state multiplicity such as combusion, chemical vapor                     deposition, high performance ceramic materials and design of                    corrosion resistant alloys.                                                                                                                                     Many chemical and physical systems may reach different steady                   states under the sam operating conditions.  A common feature of                 all these systems is the occurence of nonlinear flux-force                      relations and some feedback (communication) mechanism.  The                     feedback in chemical systems may be caused by an auto-                          accelerating or self-inhibitory reaction step or feedback is due                to changes in either the physical properties or reaction rate                   with conversion.                                                                                                                                                The main difficulty in analyzing and predicting the multiplicity                features of practical systems, in which several reactions occur                 simultaneously, is that the governing equations are highly                      nonlinear and contain a very large number of parameters.  Thus,                 it is extremely difficult, and often practically impossible, to                 determine the multiplicity features from a parametric study in                  the multi-dimensional parameter space, without having suitable                  theoretical guidance.  These mathematical difficulties have                     restricted most studies to limiting cases in which only a single                reaction occurs, even though most practical problems associated                 with steady-state multiplicity are encountered in systems in                    which several reactions occur simultaneously, and are due to the                \"taking over\" by an unwanted reaction.                                                                                                                          The theoretical work will center around modeling intra - as well                as interpractical temperature gradients in individual catalyst                  pellets (thus introducing distributed parameter analysis) as well               as modeling of the multiplicity features of packed bed tubular                  reactors.  The experimental work will be used to verify these                   models.  This information will enable a safer and more reliable                 design of control and start-up policies.  The PI is one of the                  leaders in this area and the facilities are excellent.  A three                 year continuous grant is recommended at $73,340 out of FY 86                    $70,537 out of FY 87 funds, and $69,966 out of FY 88 funds.",
