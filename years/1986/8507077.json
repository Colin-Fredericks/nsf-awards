 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops a novel approach to measure and verify the               extent of disturbances induced while preparing soil samples for                 geomechanic tests.  The soil will be modeled as a dilatant                      strain-hardening frictional material to account for soil-wall interface         effects during sampling.  An elaborately designed laboratory                    arrangement will be used to monitor induced disturbances and determine          the extent of stress and pore water pressure changes while taking               samples from a soil block.  The results from the model study will be            correlated with experimental data.  The importance of measuring induced         disturbances in soil samples has been well recognized by the                    geomechanic community.  A quantitative method to assess the extent of           these disturbances has, thus far, not been developed.  The research             approach is innovative and has a potential to make a significant impact         in geomechanic experimentation.",
