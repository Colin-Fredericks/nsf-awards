 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to assemble and deploy the basic components         of a well-equipped vision laboratory, to support teaching and                   undergraduate research in a broad range of visual processes.  Major             equipment items include a radiometer/photometer, an optical bench and           accessories which can be configured as a two-channel Maxwellian view            system, a grating monochrometer for studying wavelength effects on              vision, and a versatile system for testing contrast sensitivity effects.        Provision is made in the project for computer control of experimental           procedures and data acquisition.                                                                                                                                The equipment has been selected primarily for laboratory projects and           classroom demonstrations in a course on Sensory Processes, and for              pursuit of independent research and honors projects by advanced                 students.  In addition, the equipment will be used in such other                teaching contexts as Introductory Psychology, Neuroscience and                  Perception, and the Psychology Department's program for Junior majors.                                                                                          Psychophysics is one of the most easily communicated areas of                   experimental psychology, offering startling perceptual phenomena, but it        is rarely encountered in undergraduate teaching programs.  Thus this            project, while basic in its scope, is expected to have a substantial            impact upon the curriculum.",
