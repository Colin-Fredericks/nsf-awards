The goal of the              Center is to advance the fundamental engineering knowledge base for new         technologies in the structure-related industries.  Multidisciplinary            research thrusts will be in:  (1) new and better design concepts                integrated with fabrication and operation; (2) powerful, new                    computer-based tools developed and utilized in design, fabrication, and         life-cycle monitoring; (3) higher strength, higher value-added                  materials; (4) robotics and automation integrated in the fabrication            and construction; and (5) new sensors, coatings, and protective                 systems.  Engineering education in large structural systems will be             emphasized at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  New                  multi-disciplinary graduate courses to be developed will be team taught         and will be required of all graduate students associated with the               Center.  Other institutions expected to participate are Bucknell                University, Lafayette College, and Villanova University.",
