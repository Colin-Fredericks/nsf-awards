The computers and peripherals will be donated to the project by IBM.            The network will facilitate close working relationships among national,         state, and local educational agencies and serve private organizations           who wish to use it.

Information distributed on the primary network will reach teachers in           each state through intrastate computer networks or existing intrastate          newsletters.  Organizations dedicated to improving science education            will be contacted and encouraged to link to the network directly, or            indirectly through their state science supervisor.",
