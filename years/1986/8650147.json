 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities Project will provide professional development        for 30 outstanding chemistry teachers from northwest Ohio, southeast            Michigan, northeast Indiana and elsewhere.  The workshop will run for           two weeks in late July and will be followed by five sessions throughout         the school year.  Skills in chemistry teaching will be renewed and              developed through extensive, hands-on laboratory activities, provocative        demonstrations and group discussion sessions.  Participants will have           access to the use of shop facilities and consultation, and they will            make demonstration devices.  They will also practice presenting                 demonstrations under the guidance of leaders in chemistry education and         will critique the performance of one another.  In addition, they will           develop new skills in computer programming and interfacing in chemistry         education.  During the summer sessions and the academic year,                   consultants with special expertise in chemistry education will meet with        the participants to develop skills and insights in a variety of special         areas including problem solving, the development of conceptual and              logical structures, and chemistry curricula. We anticipate that                 participants will rediscover the sense of excitement that initially drew        them into the field of chemistry.  We also anticipate that they will            return to their classrooms not merely to talk about chemistry but to            share their excitement and interest.",
