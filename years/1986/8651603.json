 "awd_abstract_narration": "A report on the international results from the longitudinal portion of          the IEA Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) will be prepared          by an international team of mathematics educators and other educational         researchers and will appear as Volume III in a series to be published by        Pergamon Press, London.  SIMS is a cross-national study of the content          of the curriculum, what is taught and what is learned in school                 mathematics at two age/grade levels, Grades 8 (Population A) and 12             (Population B), in the United States and several other countries.                                                                                               This investigation will examine mathematics learning (\"growth\") during          the course of a year of instruction and its relationship to specific            teaching practices and processes in lower secondary school mathematics          classrooms (Population A) in eight participating countries \u0131Belgium             (Flemish), Canada (British Columbia and Ontario), France, Japan, New            Zealand, Thailand, and the United States!.  This investigation of               student performance and teaching practices, within a broader socio-             cultural perspective than is possible using only within-country data,           represents a unique opportunity to inform national policies and                 practices at a time of concern about the quality of American mathematics        and science education.",
