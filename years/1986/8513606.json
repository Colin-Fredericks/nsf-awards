 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental Rayleigh-Benard type experimental and theoretical studies           are performed to measure for the first time the effect of interfacial           phenomena on the stability and structure of thermocapillary and                 buoyancy driven conection in low Prandtl number liquid metal and                semiconductor fluids.  The experiments will be carried out on liquid            tin and lead heated from below and will utilize an ultrahigh vacuum             system with an ion sputter gun and a unique Auger and ELS analysis              capability for establishing and maintaining atomically clean surfaces           at working temperatures for extended periods of time.  The system               allows for measuring monolayer concentration levels of surface active           materials.  Stability limits and surface morphology will be verified            for low Prandtl number fluids experimentally for both the onset of              convection and the nonlinear transition to oscillatory convection modes         as a function of solute concentration, evaporation rates and aspect             ratio.  Theoretical studies designed to guide and interpret the                 experimental work will include two and three dimensional analyses of            instability and bifurcation phenomena in fluid layers.  The effect of           interfacial phenomena, including surface concentraion, vapor recoil,            surface adsorption and deflection will be studied in detail.",
