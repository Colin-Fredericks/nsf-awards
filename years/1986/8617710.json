 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposed by Professor Delcher will explore the use of the           new compact-disk read-only-memory (CD-ROM) technology for                       cross-disciplinary archival searches for recent research results.               During 1986 the leaders of the engineering societies were assembled by          the Engineering Directorate at NSF to explore ways the profession could         adapt to the challenges of the next decade.  One working group analyzed         new methods of dissemination of research results which could speed              innovation by U. S. engineers.  A key finding was that CD-ROM                   technology offered an exciting opportunity to provide unprecedented             access to all the archival research papers of the societies including           graphical data with full text searching that would ease                         cross-disciplinary research.  In the current project, abstracts of              papers appearing in the leading engineering society journals will be            encoded onto a CD-ROM disk along with an index that will speed full             text searches on a personal computer.  Graphical information may be             included and possibly the full text of research papers.  Software for           searching will be provided.  The CD-ROM disk produced by this project           should serve as demonstration to the engineering societies of the               feasibility of their providing date in this new medium.  The overall            objective is to speed innovation in the engineering disciplines.",
