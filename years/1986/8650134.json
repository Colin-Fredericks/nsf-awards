 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade the content knowledge and teaching skills in          the physical and earth sciences of elementary school teachers.  The             project will provide basic training for elementary school teachers and          also produce leaders from each of 24 elementary schools.  Phase I               consists of an intensive four-week summer workshop.  Phase II includes          three all-day sessions on Saturdays during the following academic year.         In addition, the project staff will visit classrooms of participant             teachers at least once during each semester.  Phase III will focus on           the training of teacher leaders.                                                                                                                                Phases I and II are designed to help teachers that want and need help           with their science background and skills.  Phase III is designed to             recognize and develop those teachers who are already knowledgeable and          deserve additional support.  These teacher leaders will serve as on-site        resource persons for their respective schools, providing assistance to          other teachers.",
