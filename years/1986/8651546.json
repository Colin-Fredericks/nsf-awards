 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to foster inter-American cooperation for         the improvement of physics instruction through the development of local         and multinational networks.  These networks will take shape at an Inter-        American Conference on Physics Education which is to be held in Mexico          in July, 1987.                                                                                                                                                  As a result of the conference, topical network groups will be formed            within the United States to become the links between the conference and         existing national networks.  These groups, composed of leading physics          educators, most of whom will have attended the Conference, will meet            after the conference to initiate new networks or strengthen existing            ones based on the topical areas identified by the conference                    participants.  The areas targeted for action may include such special           topics as:  Educational Research in Physics, Teaching Modern Physics,           Linking Physics and Technology in the Classroom and Encouraging                 Laboratory Work and Low-Cost Experimentation.                                                                                                                   The project will emphasize problems of physics education in the                 countries of the Americas--Latin America, the Caribbean, the United             States and Canada.  Pooling of ideas from all the Americas, discussion          of experiences, and examination of solutions to problems will be                beneficial to all participating countries inspite of differences among          their educational systems.  Communication networks established for              conference purposes as well as those created informally among                   participants should lead to useful forms of regional or hemispheric             cooperation.",
