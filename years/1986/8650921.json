 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Astronomy Group of Mankato State University will expand its                 observing facilities by adding a 16-inch telescope to Standeford                Observatory.  The telescope will be housed in a new five-meter dome at          the present Observatory site.  The telescope will be used primarily to          train advanced students in astronomical research techniques and                 telescope use.                                                                                                                                                  The 16-inch telescope is an f/13.5 Cassegrain reflector built by Sigma          Research Inc.  It is microprocessor controlled and is able to use a             variety of auxiliary instruments.  Initially the telescope will be              equipped with an astronomical camera and a photometer.  Later a                 spectrograph will be acquired for use with the telescope.  The Sigma 16         optical system is convertible to a Coude' optical configuration, and the        microprocessor control system can be interfaced to a minicomputer.                                                                                              Students in an Observational Techniques course will use the telescope to        obtain astronomical plates for astrometric reduction, photometric data          for photometric reduction and eventually spectrograms for spectrum              analysis. The telescope will be used by students to conduct a modest            research program.  The area of this research will probably be variable          star photometry.  It is expected that this student research will yield          publishable results.",
