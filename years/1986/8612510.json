Faculty curriculum coordinators from the universities are responsible           for developing Industry Instruction Modules which are taught by                 industry faculty and incorporated into the classroom instruction at the         participating universities.  Three instructional modules have been              identified in the areas of automated manufacturing, high-frequency              electronic circuit design, and electronic measurement.  The Industry            Instruction Modules are produced on location at the industry sites.             They are broadcast from regional centers with electronic studio                 classrooms located near the industry.  Live two-way video and audio             interaction between the campus class and the industry instructor are            provided during the broadcast.",
