 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Virginia has proposed        to replicate the methodology and findings of the Second International           Mathematics Study (SIMS) by designing and conducting a comprehensive            survey of the eighth and twelfth grade mathematics programs for the             Commonwealth of Virginia and for two selected school divisions within           the Commonwealth.  The findings will be used to identify strengths and          weaknesses of the mathematics curriculum at the state and division              levels, in light of SIMS data available on the national and                     international levels.  The resulting information will be taken into             account in curriculum reform activities in the Commonwealth.  This              application of the SIMS methodology is expected to provide a powerful           model for assessing mathematics programs that will be used elsewhere            within Virginia and could have utility in other states and regions of           the United States, as well.  The main objective of the study is to              develop a model for program assessment and evaluation at the state and          local levels in order to provide detailed, high quality data for                curriculum supervisors, classroom teachers and school administrators in         assessing their current curriculum and in identifying new directions for        improvement.                                                                                                                                                    The project will be carried out in three phases:                                (i)  Curriculum Analysis Phase: An analysis of the curriculum will be           conducted for the two target populations:  (1) all eighth grade students        and (2) those students in twelfth grade college preparatory mathematics         classes.  This curricular information will be used to assess the                adequacy of the item pool of the Second International Mathematics Study         for program evaluation in Virginia.  If necessary, the item pool will be        augmented to adequately reflect major content areas in the Virginia             curriculum.                                                                                                                                                     (ii)  Testing Phase: Probability samples of classes will be drawn from          the entire state for each of the two target populations.  Concurrently,         two school divisions will be targeted for study.  The students will be          tested (attitudes and achievement) at the end of the 1986-87 school             year.                                                                           Data will be obtained from teachers on \"opportunity-to-learn,\" that is,         the extent to which the subject matter on the tests has been taught to          the students being tested, and on classroom processes used for selected         topics in the curriculum.                                                       (iii)  Analysis and Reporting Phase: Data will be analyzed and reports          will be generated for use of classroom teachers and supervisors and             personnel at the Virginia Department of Education.  Reports will also be        prepared that will be of interest to professionals at corresponding             levels of responsibility outside of the Commonwealth.",
