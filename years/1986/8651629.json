 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perhaps the most important changes that ought to be made in traditional         mathematics textbooks in order to prepare learners for a technological          world have to do with the way mathematical concepts are taught in the           first place, how they are practiced, and the kinds of applications that         are presented.  Many of these changes are not dependent on the use of           calculators and computers, and some are currently finding their way into        commercial textbooks.  Others, which depend on activities in which              calculators and computers play an important role, are slower to appear          significantly in commercial texts because of the unlikely commercial            success of a text series that requires access to calculators and                computers throughout.  This project will focus on materials that model          changes of the latter type.                                                                                                                                     The project will develop supplementary mathematics materials for grades         K-6 that will assume universal access to calculators and easy access to         computers in the classroom.  The materials will encourage problem               solving, mathematical thinking, and intelligent use of technology.  The         final product will be a series of pamphlets (teacher materials and              student materials) that can be used with any existing K-6 mathematics           textbooks.  A bibliography of appropriate calculator and computer books,        software, and other materials will be provided in the pamphlets and             referred to where appropriate.",
