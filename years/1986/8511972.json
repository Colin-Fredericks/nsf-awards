 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop additional concepts and methods, as well as          extend existing concepts, for quantitative assessment of seismic                structural damage and reliability, and implementation of                        damage-limiting aseismic design.  The specific components of the                program are as follows:  to develop quantitative models for defining            seismic damage of structures, to define damage-related ground motion            intensity, and to develop criteria and suggest associated procedures            for designing damage-limiting earthquake-resistant structures within            the framework of reliability.  The research is expanded on the noval            damage model already developed based on the established damage                  tolerance levels and a newly defined damage index.  Further improvement         is necessary to cover various material types and structural systems.            The results would lead to major improvements in seismic design and              provde a means to maintain adequate safety at acceptable costs.",
