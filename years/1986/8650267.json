 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides equipment to enhance the research experience of           the approximately 85 students who take courses or do independent                research in biopsychology each year.  Acquisition of sufficient                 laboratory equipment enables Bates students to gain the hands-on                experience that is essential for a thorough understanding of this               rapidly growing field.  Through the new laboratory equipment, students          develop new research techniques, perfect previously acquired skills and,        equally importantly, discover for themselves the major principles of            biopsychology.  Stereotaxes, a microtome, electrical stimulators, and           oscilloscopes facilitate the acquisition of physiological skills                associated with small animal (rat) neurosurgery, histology, and                 electrical self-stimulation.  To enhance students' capacity to do               sophisticated animal behavioral research, operant chambers and                  microprocessors with which the chambers can be interfaced are being             installed in the teaching laboratory.",
