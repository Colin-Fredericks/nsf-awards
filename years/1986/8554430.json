 "awd_abstract_narration": "To continue its efforts in initiating and conducting programs to                strengthen science education, particularly chemical education, at all           precollege levels, the Institute for Chemical Education is offering a           series of programs for teachers during the summer of 1986.                                                                                                      Different programs are offered to elementary and middle school teachers         of science and high school teachers of chemistry:                                                                                                                       (A)Chemistry Update is a six-week content mastery program               for chemistry teachers.                                                                 (B)Chemical Supplements for Pre-High School Classes is                  open to elementary, middle, and high school teachers                            for two weeks.                                                                          (E)Chemical Instrumentation Update, for well-prepared                   high school teachers is offered for two weeks.                                          (F)Chemistry Can Be Fun Camp includes several one-week                  programs for middle-school students.                                            Participants in Programs A and, in particular, Program B will work with         the students in Program F and be provided the opportunity to work               directly with young students in the chemistry laboratory.  The                  University of Wisconsin-Madison will run all the programs, the                  University of California-Berkeley will run programs A, and E, the               University of Arizona will run programs B, E, and F, and the University         of Maryland will run programs A, B, and F.                                                                                                                      Three hundred and sixty teachers from all parts of the United States            will have an opportunity to participate in the multi-faceted project.           Participants will be given a thorough content update, strategies for            implementing more effective science education, and training to help them        in-service their colleagues upon their return to their home schools.            The multiplier effect is built into this project as school systems are          asked to take responsibility for partial support of their teachers and          to commit themselves to the outreach component of the project.",
