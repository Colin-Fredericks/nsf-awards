 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is provided for research on the mechanisms by which phenolic            substances are degraded by anaerobic microorganisms.  This research is          specifically directed at chlorinated phenols, nitrophenols, and                 methylphenols which are produced synthetically or which may be an               intermediate decomposition product of more complex organic substances.          Metabolism of these compounds under methanogenic and nitrate reducing           conditions will be characterized as to the rate, extent, and major              metabolites of degradation.  In addition, their genotoxicity and any            changes in genotoxicity as a result of anaerobic metabolism will ber            determined.  Completion of the work will elucidate the differences or           similarities in the anaerobic metabolic pathways of the compound under          the two reducing conditions and relate them to genotoxicity.",
