 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the purchase of a liquid scintillation counter (LSC), the               Biology Department at Valdosta State College is adding radioisotope             experiments to its curriculum in Immunology and Cellular Biology and, to        a lesser extent, to laboratory work in Chemistry and Physics.  The              Cellular Biology laboratory has completed the first phase of its                development, and students have grown mammalian cells under varying              growth conditions.  Acquisition of the LSC completes the second phase of        the development plan.  Students now are able to carry out experiments at        the molecular level.  This will enable them to work through techniques          which are aimed at gaining a better understanding of principles that lie        at the foundation of modern molecular biology.  Support for the Physics         and Chemistry Departments through this project also contributes to the          modernization of their laboratories, enabling all three departments to          provide their undergraduates with a safe introduction to laboratory uses        of tritium and carbon-14.  Valdosta State enjoys an enviable reputation         for sending graduates on to advanced studies, and the benefits gained           through this project should enhance the preparation received by many of         its science majors.",
