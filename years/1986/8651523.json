 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test an instructional strategy designed to increase           the pool of minority students who are successful in their study of              algebra and higher mathematics courses.                                                                                                                         Since 1979, the Comprehensive Math and Science Program at Columbia              University has been developing an instructional model designed to give          all entering ninth grade students the opportunity to work to their              highest level of capacity in mathematics.  Key features of the model are        a zero-based start, which makes no assumptions on students' prior               mathematics background, and a complementary curriculum, which provides a        set of parallel, interlocking mathematics courses that substantially            increases the rate of mathematics instruction over a four semester              period.  Preliminary tests of the model in New York City schools have           yielded encouraging results.                                                                                                                                    In the current project, the instructional materials will be completed           and the model will be extensively tested in New York City and in Fulton         County, Georgia.  The testing will be accompanied by the development of         an apprenticeship model for teacher training, which will pair new               teachers with experienced teachers in the interlocking courses of the           program.",
