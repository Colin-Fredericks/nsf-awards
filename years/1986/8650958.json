 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to restructure the existing Immunology              course so as to include a laboratory section, and to update and expand          the quality of the laboratory experiences offered in such other courses         as Microbiology, Biochemistry, Physiology, Hematology, and the                  Undergraduate Seminar, through the purchase of equipment needed to              improve the curricular contents.  These changes are expected to enable          students to meet the challenges of a technological society.  Among the          instruments required to accomplish these course improvements are                chromatographic, fractionating, ultraviolet analysis and recording              equipment, electrophoretic apparatus for the analysis and isolation of          antigens, and two good research microscopes for the study of the                histology of lymphoid tissues.  This project is having an impact on             Hispanic students majoring in science and those in the University's pre-        health track.",
