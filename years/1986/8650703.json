 "awd_abstract_narration": "With computer-automated telemonitoring equipment provided through this          grant, the Wildlife Biology faculty of the Arkansas Tech University has         created a facility for recording and analyzing the activities of radio-         equipped animals at a 200-acre outdoor laboratory adjacent to the               campus.  The facility will provide students in ecology, animal behavior,        and fisheries and wildlife management courses an opportunity to study           daily and seasonal activity patterns, movements, habitat use,                   territoriality, dispersion, and social organization of the animals              inhabiting this area.  Instruments to be purchased for the facility             include an integrated radio-telemetry system for the transmission and           reception of each animal's location and activity, and an interfaced             microcomputer for data storage and analysis.  Use of the telemetry-             computer system, in concert with traditional methods of wildlife                observation, will provide a unique opportunity to supplement classroom          learning with a dynamic, problem-oriented learning experience in the            field.                                                                                                                                                          In addition to use in regular undergraduate courses, the facility will          serve the needs of local high school biology teachers enrolled in in-           service workshops, of upper-division students enrolled in individual            directed-research projects, and of local area high school students              participating in ATU's \"gifted and talented\" science program.  This             relatively low-cost effort promises to have an enormous impact upon the         teaching of animal ecology and ethology in this institution, and to have        a valuable spillover benefit for biology programs in the local high             schools.",
