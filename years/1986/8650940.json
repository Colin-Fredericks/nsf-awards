 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve undergraduate laboratory work in Biotechnology        by providing a highly instrumented fermentation facility which permits          senior-year majors to scale up their projects from a single laboratory          flask to an on-line production level.                                                                                                                           While biotechnology is a diverse interdisciplinary field, its origins           are in biology.  Mankato's Biology Department has played the leading            role in defining and developing what will constitute the major program          in biotechnology.  Mankato State University students complete a rigorous        selection of courses in biology, chemistry and physics prior to the             senior year of the program.                                                                                                                                     During the senior year the students are involved in classes and                 laboratories that address one of the major problems in the discipline:          \"scale-up\".  To accomplish this, students enroll in a three-quarter             sequence entitled Biological Engineering Analysis and concurrently in a         Biotechnology Laboratory.  The former introduces the student to the             analytical aspects of scaling up a bioconversion and the latter requires        the student to apply these principles in the design and execution of a          project.  More specifically, students will work in teams on a project of        interest to a faculty member or a sponsoring industry, and will be              responsible for isolating/constructing an organism that carries out a           bioconversion, and then scaling up the process.  Students will have             hands-on use of this highly instrumented fermenter facility, using their        engineering skills to optimize and scale up their projects.",
