 "awd_abstract_narration": "The immediate goal of this project is to introduce a set of computer-           assisted laboratory experiments for NMR spectroscopy which will in turn         increase the computer literacy of undergraduate students as they proceed        through the chemistry program at Roosevelt University.  The project uses        a 60-MHz continuous wave NMR spectrometer, an instrument common to many         laboratory courses and one which has easily accessible external                 connections for data acquisition and instrument control.  The                   availability of the extensive ASYST laboratory software package for IBM         microcomputers with high-resolution graphics allows students to analyze         spectra in a number of ways, and prepares students to use the more              expensive laboratory workstations commonly found in industrial and              academic research laboratories.  This software allows students to focus         immediately on analyzing data rather than setting up and programming            equipment.  The project will provide at least one computerized                  laboratory experiment in each laboratory course from Organic Chemistry          to Laboratory Microcomputer Systems.  Since the computerized experiments        appear in each upper-division laboratory course, the majority of the 200        chemistry students will have computer experience every semester rather          than in a single concentrated course.  The series of NMR spectroscopy           experiments will give each student the opportunity to operate                   comfortably and proficiently a laboratory workstation for acquisition,          analysis, and presentation of data. The flexibility of the hardware and         software allows future projects to computerize other laboratory                 instruments and develop similar sets of laboratory experiments.",
