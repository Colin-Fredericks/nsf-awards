 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the improvement of science and mathematics          teaching in the New York City area through the establishment of a Center        for Science and Mathematics Education.  The Center, established at City         College, will coordinate the specific project activities aimed at               accomplishing its goal.  These activities include:  1) leadership               training workshops for principals and science administrators in order to        train, motivate, and support their teachers, 2) in-service science and          mathematics courses for elementary and secondary teachers to increase           their content background and enhance their pedagogical skills, and 3)           conferences for educators on topics in science and mathematics education        to provide participants up-to-date information on specialized topics and        to provide practical support for their teaching efforts.  A bimonthly           Newsletter, funded by local sources, will be published to provide a             teaching information exchange.                                                                                                                                  There will be two, two-day Leadership Training workshops held in the            fall of each year, one for elementary principals and science                    administrators, and one for junior high principals and science                  administrators.  Follow-up workshops will be held in the spring.  Twelve        courses will be offered in pairs, one course being content-oriented and         the second emphasizing the educational applications of that content at          the appropriate grade level. Two pairs of courses are offered for               elementary teachers, one for either elementary or junior high, two for          junior high, and one for high school teachers.  The topics covered are          physical science, computer programming and applications, and                    mathematics.  One hundred and eighty teachers will be able to take              advantage of these courses which will be offered during the academic            year and during the summer.  The conferences will be held in the fall           and spring of each school year.",
