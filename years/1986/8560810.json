 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed towards improving the damping of automotive           structural and mechanical components.  This is accomplished by                  exploiting the stress coupling of anisotropic composite material                structural subsystems for use in laminated constructions.  The                  subsystem is a sandwich component with elastic faces and viscoelastic           core.  A structural design is proposed which will increase the level of         stressing and thus energy dissipation in the viscoelastic layers.  Such         a design would have widespread use as a tool for noise and vibration            control.  The success of the design will lead to a number of commercial         applications both within and out of the automotive industry.  A                 complete study to determine the potential of the damped sandwich                subcomponents, to identify commercial applications, and to create               appropriate design guidelines and analytical tools would require an             extensive experimental and analytical program.  An appropriate                  structural theory for the damped laminate analysis will be formulated.          The solution of a specific practical problem will be found.  Parametric         studies will be performed and the merit of the proposed subcomponent            will be established.",
