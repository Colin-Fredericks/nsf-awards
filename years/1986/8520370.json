 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates the mechanisms that are involved and                    development of quantitative criteria in the segregation of food                 powders.  One of the major findings of the investigation so far is the          phenomenon o migration of already adhered fines to particles of another         powder.  This migration depends on a selective surface affinity and can         be used to remove dusts from particles and equipment by a dry process.          The same phenomenon, however, can also have an adverse effect on the            appearrance of powders having absorbed colorants or influence the type          of distribution of fines within ordered mixtures in general.  Whether           there exist distribution coefficients that depend on the particle's             chemical species and surface properties has not yet been established            nor has the kinetics of such processes been quantified.  Attrition              experiments have produced a large body of data and quantitative                 information on the process and its kinetics.  It is planned to use this         information, as well as data from the literature, for testing the               applicability of mathematical models and computer simulation methods.",
