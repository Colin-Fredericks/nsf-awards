 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering ((NISEE)            was established to facilitate the collection, organization, and                 dissemination of information on earthquake engineering and related              subjects.  In addition to the component of NISEE at the California              Institute of Technology, there is also a unit of NISEE at the                   University of California, Berkeley.  NISEE/Caltech operates a research          library and serves as a source of information for researchers,                  engineering organizations, and public officials.  NISEE's Earthquake            Engineering Library contains numerous items for users, including books,         monographs, reports and a collection of earthquake slides, photographs,         and seismograph records.  The objective of NISEE/Caltech during the             next 2 years will be to maintain and expand the existing collection of          resource material through increased use of electronic data storage and          retrieval technology.  In addition, NISEE will begin the distribution           of important strong motion accelerogram data on floppy diskettes.               These diskettes will be formulated for popular microcompuers and                plotting software will also be provided.",
