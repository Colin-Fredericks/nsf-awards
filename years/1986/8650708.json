 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major goals of this project is to enhance the science                education of students enrolled in General Psychology through extensive          experience with contemporary and methodologically rigorous research in          the discipline. The Denison faculty is developing a microcomputer-based         laboratory which will provide students with first-hand experience in            using the methodological procedures necessary for conducting research in        the major content domains of psychology.                                                                                                                        A second major goal is to enhance students' ability to comprehend human         functioning from an integrated biological/behavioral perspective.  The          configuration of equipment modules (microcomputer, interface, and               physiological instrumentation) enable sophisticated research for                measuring cognitive and behavioral variables.  The use of this equipment        provides students with theoretical and methodological knowledge of human        functioning from a bio-behavioral perspective.  The Denison faculty is          making a significant contribution to psychology education by returning          to a vigorous experiment-centered freshman laboratory.",
