 "awd_abstract_narration": "At Lebanon Valley College, the Animal Physiology laboratory historically        has emphasized human physiology at the organismic level.  The current           instructor (director of this project) has taken steps to move the course        in a more comparative and more cellular direction.  Laboratory exercises        now include enzyme kinetics and small mammal metabolism. To implement           this change effectively, more sophisticated instrumentation was needed          to continue the development of new exercises.  This project facilitates         the introduction of three exercises which are designed to elucidate             basic physiological principles and to teach basic physiological                 techniques.  With the new microcomputer-driven instruments provided             through this award, it is possible to expose students in the teaching           laboratory to such topics as membrane potentials, active transport of           sodium ions, and basic principles of neurobiology.  The new                     instrumentation is broadening the range of student laboratory                   experience, familiarizing the students with advanced data gathering             techniques, and expanding the opportunities for independent student             research projects.  The majority of enrollees are biology or                    biochemistry majors who plan to pursue graduate degrees in                      biology/biochemistry or to attend professional schools.  Approximately          one-fourth of the total majors in biology and biochemistry, excluding           freshmen, enroll in this pivotal course each spring semester.",
