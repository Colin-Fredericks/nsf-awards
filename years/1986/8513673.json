 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport of colloidal particles by phoretic mechanisms such as                 diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis, and osmophoresis will be studied             using both experimental and theoretical methods.  The experiments               involve measurement of particle migration by two separate phenomena:            \"diffusiophoresis,\" where a concentration gradient of a simple                  electrolyte drives the motion of charged colloids, and \"ospmophoresis,\"         where vesicles move in response to a gradient of osmotic pressure in            the surrounding fluid.  The data will be used to test the theoretical           models which have been published and to show that these mechanisms of           colloidal transport are significant from an engineering, and perhaps            biological, point of view.  Theoretical work is also anticipated for            modeling the influence of proximal boundaries and nearby particles on           the diffusiophoretic or electrophoretic velocity of a particle and for          modeling the effects of non-uniform surface properties on the phoretic          response of particles.  Attempts will be made to develop models based           on phoretic mechanisms for the locomotion (self-propulsion using                chemical energy) of biological cells.",
