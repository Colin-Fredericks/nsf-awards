 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes a diversified plan to promote the professional            development of teachers and to raise the quality of teaching.  Twenty           science and mathematics teachers from junior and senior high schools in         Tennessee will participate each year.  The project will coordinate with         and complement the State of Tennessee's Career Ladder Program.                                                                                                  Participating teachers will engage in full-time energy-related research         for eight weeks during the summer.  The summer program will include             weekly workshop sessions designed to provide the opportunity to develop         resource materials and to explore creative ways to enrich the teaching          of precollege science and mathematics.                                                                                                                          To reinforce and encourage implementation of the most important aspects         of the summer research participation workshop programs, the following           complementary academic-year activities are planned:                                                                                                             Academic-Year Forums.  Six forums will be held during the academic year.        The forums will involve teachers who participate in the summer program,         other science and mathematics teachers, and students.                                                                                                           Science Mentor Visitations Program.  The research scientists who                supervise the summer research participants will make visits and given           presentations, assist students and teachers in laboratory experiments           and research projects, and provide other help in their areas of                 expertise.                                                                                                                                                      Scientist Lectures Program.  Scientists from the U.S. Department of             Energy Laboratories in Oak Ridge and from other facilities will visit           area schools to present lectures and laboratory demonstrations.                                                                                                 Teacher Bootstrap Program.  Teachers who participate in the summer              program will serve as in-residence resource teachers and will be                encouraged to make presentations and to demonstrate their knowledge and         experience.",
