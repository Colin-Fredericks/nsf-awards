 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community Science Project is an effort to improve science education         by broadening the participation of community elements in the educational        process.  Parents, business-industry, Chambers of Commerce, museum (and         related institutions), professional and trade associations,                     universities, community colleges, and trade and technical schools need          to expand their involvement in the total educational process, and work          out strategies for sharing science education obligations and benefits.          Because the resources are already in place, the project hopes to                demonstrate how major changes can be effected without necessitating             significant increases in educational costs.  In a stepwise fashion, the         project will implement and document a self-sustaining model for                 broadening educational representation and participation; exploiting             underutilized community resources; encouraging two-way, non-altruistic          interactions; and upgrading community awareness, knowledge, capabilities        and attitudes in science/society/ technology areas.                                                                                                             The plan involves identifying sectors/organizations within Howard County        that could or should be involved with science education.  These groups          will be contacted and their potential contributions to science                  education, and any needs they have that schools or other community              sectors could satisfy, will be identified and documented.  Needs and            contributions will be matched and the Principal Investigator will               arrange meetings between relevant groups, facilitate interactions, and          provide technical assistance where necessary.  Follow-up meetings with          all sectors/organiza-tions will be arranged to determine what they have         done in science education, and needs and resources lists will again be          generated.  The overall process of developing lists of needs and                resources, matching lists, and facilitating the resulting community             interactions will be continued.  The program will be expanded in a              stepwise fashion and will involve a grassroots effort. The staff,               working out of the Howard County Chamber of Commerce, will be                   responsible for identifying and recruiting experts in the community,            utilizing their expertise in the most cost-effective manner, documenting        meticulously the interactions established, and assisting the county to          develop its own strategies for maintaining the program without external         funding.",
