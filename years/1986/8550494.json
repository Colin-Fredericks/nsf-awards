 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Board of Education, in collaboration           with the State Education Agency and the Winston-Salem Foundation, has           set up a four-phase program for the training of all elementary school           teachers.  The first two phases of this long-range program have been            accomplished.                                                                                                                                                   Phase 1 of the project involved one teacher in each of the 36 elementary        schools in the county who attended a summer institute, and then shared          ideas and expertise with colleagues during the school year.  Phase 2            featured the training of teams in four specific disciplines, physical           science, biological science, earth-space science, and mathematical              problem solving.  Phase 3 will provide for an increase in the number of         team training sessions and a 10-day institute for formative training for        the teaching team.  Peer training will be carried out in each of the            elementary schools by these teaching teams.  Phase 4 will be devoted to         dissemination and replication throughout Region V.  Evaluation of this          project will allow for continuous assessment and feedback which will            enable potential problems to be corrected before the program is fully           operational.",
