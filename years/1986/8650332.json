 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics department at Cornell College will acquire instruments and          apparatus for computer-based data acquisition and analysis to modernize         the laboratory curriculum for physics majors.  The instruments will:                                                                                            o  Replace a worn-out pulse-height analyzer from the 1960's with a              computer-based system with a plug-in analyzer board.                                                                                                            o  Replace some nuclear pulse electronics modules with new ones having          increased capabilities.  The new circuits will be used to introduce an          experiment measuring the lifetime of cosmic-ray produced muons.  In this        experiment, as in several others, the computer acting as a pulse-height         analyzer will be helpful in data reduction.                                                                                                                     o  Add a general-purpose laboratory computer with a high-speed                  analog/digital interface, a plotter, diskette storage of data, and              software for data reduction and preparation of graphs.  This laboratory         computer will have immediate application with experiments in acoustic           resonance with transient excitation and fast Fourier transform analysis         of audio frequency signals, data logging in quantitative measurements of        optical diffraction patterns, and data logging with an infrared                 spectrometer.",
