 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide professional development        for 90 leadership teachers who will become a cadre of Elementary Science        Specialists over a period of three years.  They will provide leadership         for the improvement of elementary science education throughout                  metropolitan Kansas City, a bistate metropolitan area with 12                   cooperating school districts at this time.  The proposal is the product         of a sustained, cooperative planning effort that has spanned more than          one year.  The project will include working with classroom teachers and         with principals to enhance the quality and quantity of science education        in elementary schools.  The program features an innovative course of            study integrating science content with instruction that is appropriate          for elementary school classrooms.  It includes workshops for principals,        supervised internships in schools, and in-service activities conducted          by the leadership teachers throughout the participating school                  districts.                                                                                                                                                      The program involves considerable support, planning, and cost-sharing           from the cooperating school districts.  This cooperation provides some          unique opportunities to involve a variety of community institutions             including the Kansas City Zoo, The National Energy Foundation, and the          Science Pioneers. Careful evaluation is planned that will provide               important feedback to the project directors, to the cooperating school          districts, and to the teachers involved.  This model for teacher                enhancement may also serve as a prototype for the development of more           appropriate approaches to the science preparation of preservice                 elementary teachers at the University of Missouri, Kansas City.",
