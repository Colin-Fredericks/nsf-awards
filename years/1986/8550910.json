 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maryland Science Center is sponsoring Science Discovery, an approach        for introducing science to 4- and 5-year-old children in a child care           center environment.  Four different centers, public, private, inner-            city, and urban facilities, will be implementing this program in the            Baltimore area.  Qualified staff from the Science Center will visit each        classroom once a week prepared to give a half-hour presentation to the          children with the cooperation of the teachers.  Once a month, teacher-          training activities will be held in each of the four centers for the            purpose of training the teachers in the content, skills, and                    methodologies necessary to insure an ongoing program.  Materials and            equipment necessary for implementation of the science lessons will be           brought to the centers.  Follow-up activities developed by teachers and         staff will be provided each week so that teachers may have the teaching         materials to extend the lesson.                                                                                                                                 In addition to the teacher training component and the support and               resources provided by the Maryland Science Center, appropriate                  curriculum material will be developed by staff, teachers and science            educators which will be useful at the kindergarten level as well as for         preschoolers.",
