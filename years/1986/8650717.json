 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six microcomputers equipped as laboratory controlling devices for a new         student laboratory facility in the Psychology Department are enhancing          and facilitating Skidmore College's instructional capabilities in at            least three ways.  First, the kind of lab projects and simulations              previously possible to conduct in the experimental psychology lab were          limited to those that minimized the use of peripheral devices and that          lasted for 20 minutes or less.  Students received a somewhat distorted          view of the kinds of questions psychologists address, and, as a                 consequence, a distorted view of the range of theoretical issues of             concern to psychologists.                                                                                                                                       This new lab facility, therefore, is important for the enrichment of            this experimental laboratory course and other advanced courses (e.g.,           perception, cognition) as well.  Over the past 5 years an increasing            number of students have engaged in independent research and senior              theses.  This facility contributes in important ways to the development         of their research efforts.  Finally, a large number of students will be         able to participate in laboratory simulations directly, rather than by          indirectly observing another person conduct the simulations.                                                                                                    A modest amount of computing equipment with its attendant instrumental          interfacing will have a large impact upon the quality of laboratory work        available to upper division students in numerous classes and in                 independent study.",
