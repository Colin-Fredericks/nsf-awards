 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performace of low-          to medium-rise flat-slab buildings damaged during the Mexican                   earthquake of September 19, 1985, and to check the adequacy of U.S.             procedures for the seismic design of similar buildings.  Information on         Mexican design and construction practive for slab-column connections is         collected incooperation with the Mexican co-investigator.  The                  strengths, stiffnesses, and design features of these connections are            compared to those specified by U.S. building codes.  Twelve large-scale         multiple-connection and single-connection slab-column assemblies are            designed according to the U.S. practice and tested in the laboratory to         evaluate their performance into the nonlinear range of response under           earthquake-type loading.  The test assemblies include slabs with and            without edge beams.",
