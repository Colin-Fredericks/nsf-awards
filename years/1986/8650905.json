 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department will develop a new undergraduate program in              optics for students in physics and engineering.  The program will               consist of a sequence of upper division courses.  For electrical                engineering majors, the program will be offered as an option.  For              physics majors, the entire uppper division program can be structured to         provide a strong optics concentration.  Initially, the program will be          offered by the Physics Department.  Ultimately, courses will be offered         by both academic depart-ments and will be open to either group of               students.                                                                                                                                                       A major portion of the program is the development of a modern undergrad-        uate, two-semester Optics Laboratory course.  The first semester will           emphasize traditional optical experiments which illustrate the                  principles of geometric and physical optics.  In the second semester,           contemporary topics in optical science and engineering will be treated.         In both semesters, microcomputers will be used to interact with the             optical components in selected experiments.",
