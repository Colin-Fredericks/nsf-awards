 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a series of workshops designed to show high school           biology teachers and administrators how to use computer technology most         effectively in biology.  The workshops will provide an opportunity for          150 teachers from the state of Texas to attend five-day workshops               emphasizing hands-on computer experience and the associated wet labs.                                                                                           Using courseware modules developed with funding from previous NSF               grants, the program will allow participants to study plant growth and           development, cardiopulmonary physiology, foraging patterns and                  energetics, the trophic-dynamic features of a balanced ecosystem,               hormonal control of the menstrual cycle, and patterns of competition            among algae in a lake.  A set of wet lab exercises to accompany the             computer exercises will be conducted.                                                                                                                           The workshops will be held in Houston in the Fall of 1986 and on the            campus of Texas A&M University in the Summers of 1987 and 1988.  Three-         person teams at each of 10 high schools will be invited to attend each          workshop. Each team will consist of teachers and administrators.                                                                                                During the Academic Year, one-day workshops will be held in the Fall and        Spring.  In addition, visits will be made to high schools to assist in          the development of computer consciousness among teachers and students.",
