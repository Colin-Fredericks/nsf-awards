 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continuing prevalence of GC/MS instrumentation in industrial and            academic research laboratories makes it increasingly important that             baccalaureate chemists gain experience in this technique as an integral         part of their undergraduate education.  A primary objective of this             project is to give undergraduate chemistry students at California State         University-Hayward hands-on experience with GC/MS instrumentation and           its capabilities for solving problems in chemical analysis, physical            measurements, organic and inorganic synthesis, qualitative organic              analysis, and undergraduate research projects. The instrument will also         introduce students to computer control and spectral library searching.          Additionally, the unit will augment training in other chemistry courses         by providing GC/MS analysis for students of organic chemistry and               illustrative spectra for introductory courses in chemistry.",
