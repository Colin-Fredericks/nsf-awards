 "awd_abstract_narration": "The practice of requiring students to carry out academic tasks during           nonschool hours is as old as formal schooling.  Assessments of the value        of homework, however, have fluctuated over time with strong positive            opinions prevailing at the turn of this century and the early 1960's and        negative opinions holding sway in the 1930's and 1970's.  Recently, in          response to calls for higher standards of excellence in American                education, schools have begun to place increased emphasis on homework as        a means for improving student performance.                                                                                                                      Opinions of homework and its utility have never been greatly influenced         by empirical data on the subject.  This is due partly to a general lack         of public information on what research says about homework and partly to        the seemingly contradictory findings of studies.                                                                                                                The purpose of this project is to locate, describe, summarize, and              integrate the empirical research concerning the effects of homework on          numerous student outcome variables.  Outcomes will include all the              dependent measures employed in previous research, with special attention        paid to academic achievement, attitudes toward school, and study habits.        The review will go beyond previous reviews by (1) including the most            recent research; (2) paying the greatest attention to schooling,                homework, and research method characteristics that might mediate the            effects of homework; (3) focusing on homework effects on different              subject matters, with special attention paid to science and mathematics;        and (4) employing quantitative synthesis techniques to estimate the             impact of homework and uncover any subtle homework effects.",
