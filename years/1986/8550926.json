 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the knowledge and teaching background of              teachers.  The program will provide 90 hours of instruction in                  environmental science and ecology.  Five environmental concepts will be         explored during the 24-day period.  Each week's instruction will include        guest lectures, hands-on workshops, field trips, and interviews with            community leaders.                                                                                                                                              The course will meet daily throughout the month of July.  Participants          will be required to submit a group project as part of the Summer                Program.  The results of the activity will be presented to all                  participants of the program.                                                                                                                                    Participants will be K-12 teachers from the St. Louis metropolitan area.        A minimum of three years teaching experience is required.  Participants         must have approval from their supervisory or principal to attend and            release time for a post-institute day.",
