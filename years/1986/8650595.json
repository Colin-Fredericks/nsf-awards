 "awd_abstract_narration": "The addition of two environmental chambers to the Biology Department            facilities is enhancing laboratory courses (Botany, Ecology, Physiology,        Developmental Biology) and student research (required of all seniors for        graduation).  The two chambers, in conjunction with a biological                incubator already available, allow the faculty to establish controlled          environments in which experiments with plants and animals can be                performed.  The chambers are being used in three ways:  to compare              responses of plants and animals to different environments; to                   physiologically prepare organisms for experimental treatments; and to           maintain organisms in controlled conditions to reduce extraneous                environmental variation in experiments in which environmental factors           are not designed to be experimental variables.                                                                                                                  By expanding the types of experiments available to this department and          especially by allowing comparative studies of environmental effects on          organisms, these chambers greatly enhance undergraduate biology                 laboratories.  Good, clear results from lab exercises with living plants        and animals allow students to gain better perceptions of the concepts           they read about or hear about in lectures.  For student research, the           chambers increase precision and accuracy and significantly expand the           range of possible studies.",
