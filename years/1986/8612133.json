This project will design, develop, and                produce a prototype data storage and retrieval system which will                accommodate pages of text, line drawings, and continuous tone images.           The system will accept search requests in the form of a sequence of             keywords which can be associated with one another using logical                 connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"but not\", etc., and will produce in           response to each request, a list of the accession numbers, or possibly          page and word numbers, of those documents satisfying the request.  The          reading system will then present to the user on a high resolution               display, an image of the required documents, a page at a time, for              review.  Those pages which appear to be of interest can then be printed         on a suitable printer.  This program will use current technology, or            minor extensions thereof, to create a system which will meet all of the         above requirements, have a low system cost, and allow a large amount of         information to be disseminated very inexpensively.",
