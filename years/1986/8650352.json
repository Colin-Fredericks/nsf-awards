This system will be housed in the new Fiber-Optic              Communication Laboratory which is to be part of the department's Wilder         Communications Complex.  The system will provide the department's 1,100         undergraduates with state-of-the-art automated test and measurement             experience in the new technologies associated with fiber optics.  The           students will use the computerized system to analyze the performance of         optical fiber waveguides, of various fiber-optic light sources and              detectors, and of entire fiber-optic communication systems. This                laboratory experience will allow the department's graduates to make             immediate contributions in the burgeoning new fiber-optic communication         industry.",
