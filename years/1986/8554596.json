 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for continuation and further development of         a program of the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) which          developed a nationwide cadre of Physics Teaching Resource Agents.               Project staff will again recruit outstanding high school physics                teachers whose classroom practice has been judged to be exemplary and           effective. Subsequently, these resource teachers will participate in a          series of workshops dealing with strategy, techniques, content, and             technological innovation which have been tested and validated by the            AAPT.  The participants will also develop skills in conducting their own        workshops for colleagues in their own regions of the United States.                                                                                             The AAPT will provide follow-up support for the local workshops with            resource personnel, limited amounts of funding and materials, and the           loan of laboratory equipment and computers.  It is anticipated that             approximately 100 physics resource teachers will participate in the             workshops, each reaching out to approximately 60 more teachers.  Thus,          the workshop may ultimately influence approximately 6,000 teachers.  In         1985, 100 teachers participated in the program and by March 15, 1986,           203 workshops involving 3,370 participants had been conducted with              additional workshops planned for the spring of that year.                                                                                                       Three national meetings of the Physics Resource Teachers are planned.           Attendance at two of these meetings will be supported by the National           Science Foundation while support to attend the third meeting will               energetically be sought by AAPT project staff from external sources.            Participants have been quite effective in their first year in acquiring         external support, and these efforts will continue to be promoted.  It is        anticipated that this program can become self-sustaining.",
