 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the field of Design Theory and Methodology has emerged only               recently in the United States, in Europe design, particularly                   mechanical design, has long been a subject of research.  A large body           of literature on design methodologies exists that is largely unknown            and inaccessible to researchers in the United States.  Many of these            methodologies pertain only to narrowly defined disciplines and depend           strongly on assumptions about the culture and training of the people            who use them; however, the basic design research from Europe must be            studied and incorporated into the developing field of design in the             United States.  A computer-oriented innovative design method is created         using the principals of morphological analysis based on the work of             Hartkopt and Gowalski as well as the work of Zwicky.  Throughout the            project, this method will be compared with the assumptions and                  procedures or related methods.",
