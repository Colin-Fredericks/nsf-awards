 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois-Urbana Engineering Research Center for               Compound Semiconductors Microelectronics will focus on the research             needed for new optical and electronic concepts, materials, devices, and         systems.  This research is based upon gallium arsenide and other                compound semiconductors that will contribute to the elimination of the          interconnection bottlenecks that are beginning to limit the performace          of high speed digital systems.  Five different research areas have been         identified as essential for a successful realization of an optically            interconnnected high-speed digital system.  The areas, which will form          the core research of the Center for Compound Semiconductor                      Microelectronics, are:  (1) Systems Design and Analysis, (2)                    Transmission Media; (3) Optical and Electronic Devices; (4)                     Semiconductor Device Theory, and (5) Electronic Materials.  A                   significant number of new graduate students and undergraduates will be          involved in the ERC program.  The four new faculty positions allocated          to the ERC will enable expansion of the graduate curriculum in                  important areas, such as guided-wave technology.  An important feature          of the ERC plan is the \"Educator-in-Residence\" program.  Educators from         4-year colleges and other major undergraduate institutions are to be            included in the research efforts of the ERC.",
