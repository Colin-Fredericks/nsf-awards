 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide preparation for 30              middle/junior high school teachers and for up to 60 school administrators       in the use of zoological collections in science education.  Instruction         will be conducted at the Bronx Zoo by education staff from the zoo,             collaborating with experienced teachers and science administrators.             Curriculum materials during the workshop will include the Wildlife Inquiry      through Zoo Education (Project WIZE) developed with National Science            Foundation funding.  This award-winning curriculum was designed to link         classroom study with zoo field work.  The project will include experiences      with JungleLab, a classroom/laboratory over-looking lush tropical settings      in JungleWorld, which is a massive indoor exhibition of Asian habitats.         JungleLab provides unique opportunities to observe wildlife in a setting        much like that experienced by research biologists in the field.                                                                                                 Participants will be selected based upon their leadership skills in             teaching, their experiences in biology, and the willingness of their school     districts to support project activities.  We anticipate that following the      workshop each of the leadership teachers will conduct appropriate",
