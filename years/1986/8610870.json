An                   investigation of promising new techniques for the rehabilitation                (repair and/or retrofitting) of existing buildings located in regions           with soil conditions similar to those of Mexico City is conducted.              Comparative analyses of these promising techniques along with                   development and application of the most promising to the rehabilitation         of specific buildings in Mexico City and in the U.S. are made, and              guidelines for practical repair and retrofitting of existing buildings,         for use in engineering offices and by city officials are developed.",
