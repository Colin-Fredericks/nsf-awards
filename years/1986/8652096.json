 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) of           the educational progress of black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and          American Indian students of high ability (scoring 550 or above on SAT           math and scoring in the upper quartile on achievement measurement in HS         & B) who intend to enroll in college and to major in mathematics,               science, or engineering.  Three cohorts will be studied: (1) the                students in high school and beyond who were high school seniors in 1982         and subsequently were followed up at two-year intervals; (2) SAT-takers         who were high school seniors in 1984; and (3) SAT-takers who were high          school seniors in 1986. All the qualifying SAT-takers will be surveyed          by mail and a randomly selected subsample of at least 100 in each cohort        will be interviewed by telephone.  The combination of cross-sectional           and longitudinal data will permit an analysis of variables related to           the progress of the persisters and non-persisters in each cohort at             various time points.  Whether these characteristics are changing will be        of importance.",
