 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field experiments will be conducted to advance the understanding of             wind pressures of building surfaces.  The objectives of this project            are (1) to acquire a reliable data base on external and internal                pressures on and in buildings; (2) to assess the effects of wind                direction fluctuations on wind pressures, and (3) to validate available         wind tunnel and analytical models.  The firld tests will be conducted           in Lubbock, TX, where frequent high wind conditions exist; the building         to be tested is an ordinary commercial structure placed in an open,             flat, and unobstructed terrain; wind speeds and directions, at several          height levels, will be measured simultaneously with pressures, using            the automated instrumented building together with 100 ft. tower.  The           first year of research activities will concentrate on establishing the          facility, calibrating instruments, and checking the data-adquisition            system.  The second year will be devoted to build the data base,                analyze it, and compare with wind tunnel data.  A third year of field           studies, in which the building would be rotated so as to offer another          angle of atack to wind may be pursured.",
