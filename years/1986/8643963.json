 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Public Radio (NPR) has been provided with a supplementary award        of $10,000 to cover the American Association for the Advancement of             Science (AAAS) annual meeting.  The funds cover travel, housing and             meals for staff and free-lance science reporters for a week of                  reporting.  And also includes meeting with NPR's advisory panel.  An            additional $3,000 has been raised from private sources to cover total           costs.                                                                                                                                                          The AAAS meeting is the largest interdisciplinary science meeting in the        world. Support of this project will result in more extensive and                thorough coverage of the meetings by NPR for inclusion on prime-time            slots of \"ALL THINGS CONSIDERED\" and \"MORNING EDITION.\"  It will also           allow the science reporting team to evaluate coverage to date and               explore additional methods and reporting techniques to enhance and              expand the science programming on NPR.",
