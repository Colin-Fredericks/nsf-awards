To achieve this objective, participants will attend a              three-week summer workshop dealing with wave motion, sound, and light.          Instruction by staff will be provided in the lecture and laboratory             mode.  Throughout the workshop, participants will focus on the                  development of their own materials for use in their respective                  classrooms.  Participants will also engage in an academic-year follow-up        program intended to determine and enhance the classroom impact of the           preceeding summer's activities.  This program will include school               visitations by the project director and an evaluation meeting of all            participants in the spring of the year.",
