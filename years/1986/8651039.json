 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultra high vacuum (UHV) techniques are becoming standard for the study          of materials and surface problems.  This project will develop a high            quality UHV facility so that Colgate can introduce training in these            important techniques and experience with materials science problems into        their upper level laboratory program.  They intend to incorporate a             carefully supervised training module into the experimental methods              course, provide experimental exercises to support the Solid State               Physics course, and use the system as a major station in the advanced           laboratory program.  In addition, there is a wide range of research             problems in materials and surface science that are manageable for               talented undergraduates to accomplish as independent projects.  The             basis for the project is a UHV system with a stainless steel test               chamber that can be configured to accept a variety of experiments.              Additional features to be incorporated are: (1) an ion sputter gun to           get surfaces atomically clean, (2) a residual gas analyzer to support           the training program in UHV techniques, and to do experiments in                desorption of gasses from surfaces, (3) a means to prepare high quality         thin films by evaporation, and (4) a reflection high energy electron            diffraction system to investigate the structure of prepared films in            situ, and make possible electron diffraction experiments.",
