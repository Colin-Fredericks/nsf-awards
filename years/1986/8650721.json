 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide undergraduate students in computer science,           computer engineering, microelectronic engineering, and electrical               engineering the opportunity to design, implement, and test significant          digital systems.  It will provide the necessary equipment for a new             computer architecture laboratory.  This laboratory will be used                 primarily by students in two new undergraduate concentrations: the 3-           course digital systems design concentration in computer science and the         2-course very large scale integration (VLSI) design sequence in computer        engineering.  It will be used by microelectronic engineering students to        provide functional testing of integrated circuits (IC's) fabricated at          RIT.                                                                                                                                                            Three new computer aided design (CAD) workstations will provide                 schematic capture and simulation at the functional, logic, switch, and          circuit level. They will also include capabilities for board placement,         routing, and layout, as well as integrated circuit layout.  A fourth            workstation will be used for testing boards and IC's.  It includes 32           bits each of pattern generation and state analysis.  Additional                 equipment includes oscilloscopes and 2 multibus computer systems.  The          multibus systems will provide the computer interface for boards designed        by students.  The oscilloscopes will be used to analyze and debug boards        and other circuits.                                                                                                                                             The project will produce computer science students with greatly                 increased competence in hardware and embedded systems.  It will result          in computer engineering students who have considerable experience in the        design of complete systems involving VLSI components.  It will also             provide new undergraduate research opportunities for seniors in both            disciplines.",
