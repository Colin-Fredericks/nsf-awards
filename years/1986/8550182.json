 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Full Option Science System (FOSS) is a new concept in elementary            school science education proposed by the Lawrence Hall of Science.  FOSS        will be an integrated teacher-education program and classroom                   instructional package for general education in grades 3 through 6.  The         instructional package will be based on tested, reliable pilot                   activities:  the SAVI/SELPH (Science Activities for the Visually                Impaired, and Science Enrichment for Learners with Physical Handicaps).         The teacher education component will be based on pilot coursework used          at the Lawrence Hall of Science.  The materials used to prepare teachers        to be effective, confident science teachers will be the same materials          used in the classroom to teach students.  Products of the project will          include mini-units of hands-on activities covering a broad range of             science topics, student equipment and teacher's guides, and a number of         supporting documents.                                                                                                                                           Research into two important aspects of science instruction will also be         conducted.  The project will focus on the problem of delivery and               management of student equipment and on the factors that encourage the           replication and perpetuation of teacher education activities.",
