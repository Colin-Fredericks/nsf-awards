 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide an opportunity for 30 middle school teachers          to improve their research, materials-development, and problem-solving           skills in the area of earth science.  Each teacher will participate in          an intensive 3-week, field-oriented academic experience in the summer           during which time he or she will be a part of a research team attempting        to solve environmentally- related problems.  Under the supervision of a         university professor and a Master Teacher, teams will collect, analyze          and present field materials that include rocks, fossils, soils, water,          atmospheric and photographic data.  Four weekends during the academic           year will also be devoted to formal program activities.                                                                                                         This project focuses attention on science as a problem-solving activity.        Each participant, through involvement in research projects, will acquire        meaningful problem-solving skills.  Much attention will be given to             means of using both the materials acquired and developed and problem-           solving skills in the middle school classroom.  Throughout the academic         year, teachers will be required to present evidence that they are               integrating their recently acquired knowledge and skills into their             classroom activities.",
