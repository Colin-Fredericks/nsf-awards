 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will provide professional development        for 20 outstanding junior and senior high school science teachers.  The         grant provides support for the continuation and further development of a        six-week field biology and geology workshop conducted by University of          Dayton scientists.  Emphasis will be on applied biology, field ecology,         and environmental geology.  During the first three weeks the principles         of ecology and geology will be introduced with intensive field trips to         natural sites within the local environments of the schools.  The final          two weeks of the summer program will include intensive work at high             altitude ecological and geological sites.  Several high altitude                researchers will be involved in working with the teachers during this           time.                                                                                                                                                           Earlier versions of this workshop have been very successful, and this           summer program will emphasize the importance of field-based activities          for students in their own environment.  Among other things, the project         directors will talk with the principals of each participating teacher to        ask for administrative support and to emphasize the importance of field         trips for students.  The program includes an extended academic phase            that will result in the preparation of instructional modules.                   Participants will meet together during the academic year to discuss             progress, there will be several field trips to local resource sites, and        the participants will be expected to provide workshop outreach to others        in their schools and communities.  In addition, they will receive 10            semester hours of graduate credit, certificates of achievement, and will        be honored by local media.",
