 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin at La Crosse will provide teachers in rural         Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa with intensive training in energy                alternatives, chemicals in society, pollution and aquatic biology, and          biotechnology.  A three-week summer workshop will review scientific             principles, describe technological applications of science, and discuss,        at length, the responsibilities of society.  Forty selected high school         teachers from western Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, and                    northeastern Iowa will experience field trips, special lectures by              community professionals, and a large variety of appropriate laboratory          activities.  Curriculum development will be initiated and implemented           with the support of the local school districts.                                                                                                                 During the academic year following the workshop, participants will              integrate lessons involving technological applications and related              societal issues into existing curriculum in their high schools.  The            project staff will actively assist participants by visiting schools on a        regular basis for observation and support.  The workshop staff and              participants will share responsibility for the dissemination of related         educational materials to as many science teachers as possible through           attendance at professional meetings as well as at specially developed           \"sharing\" programs.",
