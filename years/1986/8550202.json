 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jefferson County Public School System is developing a year-long             junior high/middle school program in life science which emphasizes the          understanding and care of the human body.  The development will be done         in close cooperation with the University of Colorado Health Sciences            Center and with the support of local physicians and university-level            scientists and science educators.  The program will provide an                  alternative for teachers and schools seeking materials to improve their         life science curriculum and will serve as a resource for schools seeking        to integrate health topics with their existing life science course.  A          part of the program will also direct students toward an ability to make         decisions in and about their local environment.  Provisions have been           made to develop a variety of materials for this portion of the course           that will fit other \"local\" environments, i.e., a variety of exosystems         across the country. A text integrating reading activities, laboratory           activities, and student questions along with the supporting teacher's           guide will be produced.                                                                                                                                         The Jefferson County Public Schools will be joined in their effort by           The NETWORK, Inc. of Andover, Massachusetts.  The role of The NETWORK is        to create a strong training and support system for the course materials,        evaluate their effectiveness, and disseminate the materials on a                national basis.",
