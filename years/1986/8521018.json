 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the recovery of stressed and         partially injured organisms versus osmotic pressure of the recovery             medium.  Environmental isolates of Escherichia coli will be injured by          exposure to chlorine, and to oligotrophic water such that greater than          80 percent of the surviving population incurs sublethal injury.                 Following this stress, the debilitated organisms will be inoculated             into diluted preparations of enrichment media to obtain osmolarities            between 30 to 300 mOsmols.  The amount of sublethal injury resulting            from the stress and the capability of the damaged cells to repair will          be determined by comparative plate counts on nonselective and selective         media.  Laboratory results will be applied to recovery of sanitary              indicator organisms from chlorinated secondary sewage and oligotrophic          waters, and compared with current assay methods.",
