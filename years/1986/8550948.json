 "awd_abstract_narration": "READING RAINBOW is a 25 part PBS children's television series produced          by the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library, a part of        the Nebraska Educational Television Network.                                                                                                                    It addresses the national problem of more and more youngsters reading           less and less.  This award-winning television series has been successful        in using television to stimulate children ages five through nine to read        good books.  The series attracts an audience of 7.8 million children            with ratings equal to those of THE ELECTRIC COMPANY and MR. ROGERS'             NEIGHBORHOOD.  Program evaluation shows equally enthusiastic responses          from parents, teachers, librarians and, most importantly, children.                                                                                             Support will be provided for a series of five READING RAINBOW programs          which focus on scientific themes.  These episodes will be integrated            into the on-going series and build on young children's curiosity and            interest in the world as well as demonstrating to children how science          relates to all aspects of their lives.  In an increasingly technological        society, children need stimulation to seek out books related to science,        reinforcing early curiosity and  strengthening life-long interest in            science.                                                                                                                                                        Women and minorities are well represented on READING RAINBOW staff and          in the productions themselves.  Great care is taken to ensure a broad           representation of people including racial and cultural groups, female           and male, senior citizens and people with varying physical disabilities.                                                                                        Community outreach organizations involved include: the National PTA,            American Booksellers Association, American Library Association, National        Educational Association and the International Reading Association.  In          connection with the science series, Reading Rainbow staff will involve          the National Science Teachers Association and a special public relations        effort will be organized to promote READING RAINBOW to science museums          and other organizations that conduct science education program                  activities for children.",
