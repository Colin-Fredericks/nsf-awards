 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns heat transfer by natural convection.  Thermally          driven cavity flows at high Raleigh number occur in a wide variety of           scientific and industrial applications.  Of particular concern to the           semi-conductor industry are convective flows that arise in the                  preparation from the melt of high quality substrate materials.  The             manufacture of opto-electronic solid state devices for communications           technology requires substrates of greater purity and homogeneity.               Current device considerations also make it desirable to grow crystals           of larger diameter by increasing the melt size.  These production               problems are influenced by the convection patterns generated by changes         in the melt geometry.  Horizontal growth techniques of the gradient             freeze type are known to be strongly dependent on such scale effects.           Some vertical growth methods can have stagnant zones in the lower part          of the melt which also lead to manufacturing difficulties.  The                 investigation will consist of a comprehensive examination of these              cavity flows with specific reference to their aspect ratio dependence           and to the overall heat transfer across the cavity.",
