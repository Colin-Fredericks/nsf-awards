 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade the mathematics skills and teaching techniques        of teachers of grades K through 6.  The project consists of courses and         activities offered at two levels.  Level I courses and activities are           offered for teachers from grades K-3 and Level II courses and activities        for teachers from grades 4-6.  Twenty different participants will be            selected for each of these two levels during both 1986-87 and 1987-88.          Participants will be selected from within a 50-mile radius of Jackson           State University.                                                                                                                                               The program for each level will consist of both academic-year workshops         and a summer workshop.  The academic-year component will consist of             twelve evening sessions each semester and nine Saturday sessions.               During the evening sessions the participants will work with course              content and methodology.  During the Saturday meetings the participants         will discuss and share ideas regarding methods employed to effectively          implement their experiences.  Experts in the areas of teaching                  techniques and computer and calculator use, will be invited as guest            lecturers.  Principals and superintendents will be invited to attend the        Saturday sessions.                                                                                                                                              During the summer workshop, teachers will work one-on-one with                  elementary school students.  Emphasis will be placed on recognizing             individual differences and adapting teaching methods to such                    differences, on relating to learners with different interests and               backgrounds, and on planning and using a variety of teaching methods.",
