 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contamination of microelectronic components by submicron particles has          become a growing concern as the industry strives to reduce the size of          components and to increase their capacities.  Furthermore, several              processes in pharmaceutical manufacturing require total isolation from          even the clean-room enviornment and requires the use of isolation               chambers.  Fine particles are also important in a number of industrial          processes such as photography and electgro-photography and magnetic,            biochemical, and agricultural processings.  The International Symposium         will provide a very effective forum to deal with fine particles in all          of the stated processes.  Furthermore, a workshop will also be                  conducted to determine research needs and priorities in these areas.            Workshop proceedings will be widely distributed.  Eight                         symposia/workshops are planned to be held at the annual meeting of the          Fine Particle Society, San Francisco, July 28-August 1, 1986.",
