 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modern composite materials laboratory is being developed by Embry-            Riddle University with the recent acquisition of a scanning electron            microscope, an induction furnace and a data acquisition system.  With           this facility, students in aeronautical engineering are able to                 fabricate composite materials and structures to meet temperature and            other standards common in industry. Students test the materials and             structures to determine their behavior and capabilities.  The data              acquisition system is being used to monitor test results and collect            data to develop stress/strain curves, S-N curves (stress against number         of cycles) and perform statistical analyses on the uniformity of                composite materials.  Analyses of test samples at high magnification            determine bonding mechanisms, microstructure, fracture mechanics and            failure modes.  Through these experiences, aeronautical engineering             students are being prepared to undertake state-of-the-art work in               industry and/or to enter advanced research programs.",
