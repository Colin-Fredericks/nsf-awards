The program of work for 1986-87                 includes:  (1) followup reports on landslides; (2) completion of report         on economic impact of subsidence in U.S.; (3) preparation of reports on         economic impacts of expansive soils, snow avalanches, and after-ground          failures in U.S.; (4) continuation of the publication of the newsletter         with increased coverage of activities in other parts of the world; and          (5) continuation and expansion of the international information                 exchange.",
