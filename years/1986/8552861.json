 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the basic principles that determine the         engineering properties of immobilized enzyme and cell biocatalysts and          immobilized-protein affinity adsorbents.  Attention will also be                focused on thermophilic microorganisms and heat-stable enzymes.  Of             central importance of these research areas is the development of new            methodologies suitable for analyzing proteins and whole cells in                complex environments of biotechnological interest.  Fundamental studies         of extremely thermophilic organisms and their enzymes are also in               progress.  Finally, research in affinity chromatography, an extremely           powerful method for purifying biological macromolecules, is also                underway.  The goal is to identify factors that govern the efficiency           of affinity separations through measurements of key paremeter,                  molecular-level characterization of immobilized species and                     mathematical modeling.",
