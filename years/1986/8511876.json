 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reinforced and prestressed concrete structures subjected to shear and           torsion are currently being designed by empirical or semi-empirical             methods.  No satisfactory theory has yet been developed to predict the          shear strength and behavior of structures, such as shear walls and              nuclear containment vessels under earthquake or wind motion.  The main          purpose of this research is to develop a general truss model theory             which can take into account the contribution of concrete, the                   constitutive law of cracks, and the softening effect of concrete in             structures.  To establish the parameters required in the general truss          model theory, a minimum of 50 shear panels will have to be tested.              Each of the panels will be 250 x 250 x 12.7 cm. (98 x 98 x 5 in.)               Since no suitable facilities are available in the United States, the            tests will be carried out at the Kajima Institute of Construction               Technology in Japan on the basis of research cooperation.",
