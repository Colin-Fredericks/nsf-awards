 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will add to the Chemistry Department instrumentation which         will both enhance the current high performance liquid chromatography            (HPLC) capabilities and give undergraduate students experience in the           use of microcomputers to control instruments and acquire data.  Recent          advances in HPLC instrumentation and columns have resulted in powerful          applications in all the subdisciplines of chemistry.  As a result, this         instrumentation has become an essential tool of research chemists in            both industrial and academic settings.  Furthermore, recent developments        in microcomputer software have made modern instrumentation more powerful        and subsequent data analysis more efficient.  This project will                 introduce into the undergraduate curriculum at Hobart and William Smith         Colleges a series of laboratory modules in upper-level chemistry and            biochemistry courses that allow students to carry out increasingly              sophisticated investigations utilizing the HPLC and computer capability.        The students will use state-of-the-art separation technology for                separation and analysis of complex mixtures.  With the computer-enhanced        display of both single and dual detector output, students will utilize          the capabilities of computerized data acquisition to accomplish                 simultaneous separation, identification, and quantification of eluted           compounds, and rapid comparison of chromatograms by simultaneous                display.  This modern instrumentation will be used by students in their         coursework and in undergraduate research projects.",
