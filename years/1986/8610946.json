This project will conduct a coordinated research effort         with engineers in Mexico City that will be involved in reconstruction           activities.  The reconstruction process will provide an opportunity for         the U.S earthquake engineering community to observe first-hand, a               large-scale effort to determine the condition of buildings suffering            various degrees of damage, assess the existing strength and design              schemes to provide strength required by current codes, and review the           construction procedures utilized as they pertain to U.S. practice.  The         research will use the results of experimental work at the University of         Texas.  Involvement by projects will be established to ensure that the          work undertaken is pertinent to U.S. structures.",
