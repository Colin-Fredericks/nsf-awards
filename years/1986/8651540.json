 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the Fiscal Year 1985 appropriation of $82 million for NSF's          Science and Engineering Education activities, Public Law 98-371 provided        that \"$2,000,000 shall be made available for a contract to develop a            science education plan and management structure for the Foundation.\"            This study represents a major part of NSF's response to the                     Congressional mandate.                                                                                                                                          The purpose of the study is to assess the advantages and disadvantages          of alternative initiatives to NSF to address problems and opportunities         in science education (broadly defined to include science, mathematics,          and engineering), with particular attention to high-leverage, realistic         programs. The study will focus on initiatives the Foundation has put in         place to meet its objectives. In addition, the study will identify new          initiatives, not yet in place or funded, and possible management plans          which also might prove useful in meeting NSF's objectives.                                                                                                      The main study tasks are:                                                                                                                                       oTo review the prior experience of NSF and others in funding and                evaluating science education programs;                                                                                                                          oTo assist in operationally defining program objectives so that the             outcomes of NSF initiatives can be realistically and clearly measured;                                                                                          oTo assess the advantages and disadvantages of alternative initiatives          available to NSF to meet its objectives; and                                                                                                                    oTo design plans for the Foundation to evaluate, on an ongoing basis,           the quality and impact of its work.                                                                                                                             The result of the study will be an increased NSF capability to define           science education program objectives, assess the initiatives taken to           meet these objectives and, informed by ongoing assessment, institute            necessary changes in these initiatives.",
