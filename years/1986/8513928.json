 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the fundamental phenomena of wave                    propagation effects for acoustical non-destructive testing methods and          determines the behavior of a Gaussian beam propagating across a curved          fluid solid interface, evaluates the wave field produced near the               transducer and in regions far from the transducer, and establishes the          non-linear interaction with focused beams.  The results of this                 research will improve the understanding of the complex interaction              occurring as the waves encounter the fluid-solid interface.  The                development of a Rayleigh wave on the surface which may develop for             certain impingement angles is an important event, if surface flaws are          to be detected.  If interior flaws are to be examined, the development          of Rayleigh waves must be avoided because they detract from the energy          of the beam used to probe interior regions of the specimen.  The                acoustic beam method is an effective non-destructive technique for              defining the size and shape of both surface and internal flaws.",
