A four-week workshop, which will include the areas          of physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy, will be held during the          summer of 1986.                                                                                                                                                 The teaching of science for inquiry will be stressed, and emphasis will         be placed on a number of methods of teaching physical science that              require investigative approaches by both student and teacher.  The              program will be liberally scheduled with laboratory and problem-solving         activities and will provide time and support for independent study under        faculty guidance.                                                                                                                                               The project director and instructor will provide follow-up support in           classroom implementation of the science curriculum, in the development          of a laboratory resource center, and the science in-service training            program at the schools.",
