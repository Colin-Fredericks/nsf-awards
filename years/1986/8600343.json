The            objective of the conference is to bring together leading researchers            and practitioners of the fields of finite element analysis and CAD to           discuss the present state of computational methods and their                    integration in computer aided design.  Specific emphasis will be given          to the accuracy and reliability requirements of the computational               procedures and software used.  The following topics will be included:           accuracy and reliability requirements in practical finite element               analysis and industrial applications; accuracy measures in finite               element analysis, automatic construction, and adaption of meshes; solid         modeling and finite element analysis and graphics; artificial                   intelligence and expert systems; and verification and quality assurance         of software and computer usage (software/hardware design).  During the          3-day conference, 30 leading experts will provide overviews of                  different aspects of the above topics.",
