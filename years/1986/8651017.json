 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty in the Departments of Biology and Microbiology are undertaking a        significant enhancement of courses in Molecular Biology, Microbiology,          and Genetics.  The vehicle by which this advance is being achieved is           the introduction of recombinant DNA techniques  into selected courses,          one of which is entirely new.  Concomitant with this is a greater               integration of the teaching activities of the Biology and Microbiology          Departments.                                                                                                                                                    The degree in which recombinant DNA technology has advanced in recent           years makes it quite feasible to teach techniques of gene manipulation          to advanced undergraduate students.  This provides both a body of               knowledge and technical skills which should enhance the competencies of         these undergraduates.  It also provides the necessary basis on which            many of the undergraduates could make a decision regarding further study        in graduate school.  As recombinant DNA technology permeates more areas         of biology and is applied to an expanding number of disparate problems,         knowledge of it becomes increasingly necessary in the undergraduate             curriculum.  The equipment provided through this award will enable the          faculty to employ their biotechnology skills more effectively in their          teaching -- to the great advantage of the curriculum.",
