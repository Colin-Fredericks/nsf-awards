 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research on mathematics education and the psychology of learning         indicates that mathematics instruction should recognize and support the         role that students play in constructing their own understanding of              mathematics.  This requires a curriculum that enables students to               experience mathematics as serving useful and interesting purposes, that         treats problem solving as the central mathematics activity, and that            builds mathematical concepts on concrete experiences.                                                                                                           This project will lay a foundation for a new elementary mathematics             curriculum that responds to these needs.  It will outline learning goals        for a K-6 mathematics curriculum that will enable students to master the        mathematical tools and procedures essential for literacy in an                  information age, define a complete scope and sequence, develop prototype        curriculum modules, and produce supporting materials for teacher                training and student assessment.  The materials will emphasize problem          solving and applications of mathematics, incorporate the best                   traditional materials, and fully integrate the calculator and computer,         as tools, into the curriculum.",
