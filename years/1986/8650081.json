 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities Project will provide professional development        for 120 outstanding junior and senior high school science teachers.  The        teachers will learn concepts and laboratory methods associated with             contemporary research at the frontiers of biology, and they will prepare        appropriate lesson plans and laboratory activities for secondary school         students.  The biologists making the presentations have been chosen on          the basis of research skills and award-winning teaching.  A feature of          the program will be a keynote address and visit with Nobel Laureate             Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA.  The program staff also includes           science educators from the local school district and from higher                education.                                                                                                                                                      This project will address topics at the frontiers of nutrition, marine          biology, genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology, human              ecology, cancer biology, electron microscopy, cell biology,                     developmental biology, and computer applications in biological research.        The laboratory program will stress methods and materials in modern cell         biology.                                                                                                                                                        Products of the project will include a book, video tapes, and laboratory        activities that are both relevant and appropriate for secondary school          students.  It is anticipated that these products will be sponsored in           part by local corporations or organizations.  Another anticipated               project outcome will be the initiation of courses or extracurricular            activities in selected secondary schools that stimulate and support             students conducting independent research projects.",
