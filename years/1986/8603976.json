 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical disruption of cells is a process currently used industrially         to obtain recombinant DNA proteins from bacterial and yeast cells.              This method yields a viscous solution that contains the product, cell           fragments, nucleic acids, and cellular proteins.  Numerous problems             including the clarification of the solution, removal of the nucleic             acids, and elimination of the extraneous proteins are incurred to               obtain the desired product.  This research intends to study the use of          a chemical means of removing proteins from bacterial and yeast cells.           Various mixtures of Triton X100 and Guanidine HC1 are to be sed to do           this.  Such a method should provide for a more easily clarified                 solution, an elimination of the nucleic acid removal step, and an               enhanced product recovery yield.  However, different methods of                 incorporating this step into an overall production process have not             been carried out.  The objective of this study is to provide methods            for doing this.",
