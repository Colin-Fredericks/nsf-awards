 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to experimentally identify the              effects of pore size on reaction rate in systems where the molecular            size of the reacting species is comparable to that of the pore sizes            within the material where the reaction is taking place.  Based on the           hypothesis that pore size influences the intrinsic reaction rate of             large molecules within porous materials, a research program will be             estalbished to investigate the effect in model reaction systems                 representative of the processing and upgrading of petroleum feedstocks          as well as those of importance in the biotechnology field.  The goal of         the research is to address questions such as:  Does the effect exist?           What differences are observed between various reaction systems, for             example, immobilized enzyme reactions versus catalytic hydrogenation            reactions?  What experimental techniques are needed to study the effect         unambiguously?  What is the functional dependence of the rate constants         on the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter?",
