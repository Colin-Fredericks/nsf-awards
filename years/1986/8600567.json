 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of the acoustic emission (AE) method to monitor rock            fractures has thus far not been successful because of the difficulities         in interpreting the recorded wave forms.  This experimental research            directly addresses the difficulties in the AE method by using large             specimens (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.6 meters in size) to reduce the effects of             reflected waves and to provide time for recording relatively long AE            events.  Modern processing will be employed in this research to                 quantify the AE method as applied to monitoring the fracture process in         rocks.  Very high frequency transducers will be employed and an                 extremely wide band recorder will be used to record the wave forms with         high fidelity.  Digitizing and processing will be performed on an               advanced scale to ensure complete and thorough analysis of the AE data.",
