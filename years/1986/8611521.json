 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program considers the spatial variation and correlation           of strong earthquake ground motion.  It is common in earthquake                 engineering to focus on the time history of ground acceleration at a            given location.  However, the spatial variation of ground motion is             potentially just as important as the time variation, and is the focus           of this study.  This research program includes analytical modeling of           ground motions, and statistical analysis of closely spaced                      accelerograms, principally from strong motion instrument arrays, and            especially the accelerograms recorded during the September 19, 1985             earthquake.  It also involves a study of patterns of building damage            and variations in local geology, all to obtain insight into the spatial         variation of strong ground motion.",
