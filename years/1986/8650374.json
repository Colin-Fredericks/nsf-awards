 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly expanding Biology Department of Washington College is               modernizing and upgrading the portions of its curriculum concerned with         cellular/molecular phenomena, i.e. its courses in Genetics, Cell                Biology, Microbiology, Aquatic Biology, Cell Physiology and                     Biochemistry, and a new course in Immunology.  Much of this advance             results from new capabilities conferred through the procurement of a            light microscope with phase contrast and fluoresence features obtained          through this award.  This new instrument permits students to actually           view such features and activities as membrane receptor sites and their          motility, antigen-antibody specificity, and membrane transport.                                                                                                 Since the Washington College Biology Department capitalizes upon its            location on the Eastern Shore of Maryland to involve itself in studying         the ecology of Chesapeake Bay, one important application of the new             microscope is to facilitate investigations that distinguish                     heterotrophic from autotrophic protozoa in mixed, naturally occurring           populations.  This award is an especially timely one for Washington             College, coming as it does on the heels of a $1.2 million special               appropriation from the State of Maryland for upgrading the school's             science facilities and for enhancing its ability to contribute to               analytical studies of the Bay.",
