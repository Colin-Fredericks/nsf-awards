 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project, centered at both Portland State             University and Oregon State University, will provide professional               development and programmatic leadership expertise to 60 \"leader teacher\"        in the upper Northwestern United States.  An additional 60 \"impact              teachers\" will participate in a 3 week summer program to enhance both           their mathematics backgrounds and teaching skills.                                                                                                              The leader teachers will also provide in-service education programs in          their local area for all mathematics teachers.  A set of demonstation           videotapes will be produced for dissemination beyond the schools                involved in the project.  Extensive follow-up by project staff will do          much to insure high quality implementation and in-service efforts.  A           conference meeting in 1987-88 will serve to evaluate the impact of the          project and provide the opportunity for determining the continuing              activities necessary for quality mathematics education in the schools.                                                                                          The \"leader teachers\" have already participated in an Honors Workshops          for mathematics teachers as part of a former NSF project developed by           the Principal Investigators.  In addition to conducting a need                  assessment in their districts, these teachers will identify the \"impact         teachers\" with whom they are going to work both in the summer program           and in their schools.  The leader teachers will participate in a one-           week intensive workshop, prior to that for the impact teachers, in which        they will develop plans for their in-service and programmatic leadership        activities during following year.  Consultants as well as program staff         will provide expertise and assistance in these endeavors.  An extensive         evaluation plan to measure effectiveness of the program for both                teachers and students has been developed.",
