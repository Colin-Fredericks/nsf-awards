 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the national problem of under-representation of         American Indians, Black Americans, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans          in science and engineering graduate programs.                                                                                                                   The project consists of a series of one-day conferences on graduate             study in science and engineering for minority students, their counselors        and graduate school recruiters. The conferences were held at nine sites:        Boston, New York, Washington (DC), Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, Los               Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. Each conference was held on the            campus of a GEM-member with the university serving as a co-sponsor.                                                                                             The goals of the conferences were: 1) to present accurate information on        opportunities for minority syudents in graduate study in science and            engineering;  2) to encourage undecided minority students to seriously          consider graduate study;  3) to offer opportunities for dialogue between        the students and minority men and women currently engaged in graduate           study; and 4) to introduce students to the wide range of national               financial support programs available for graduate study.                                                                                                        Approximately 900 students and 100 counselors, recruiters, university           faculty and representatives from related organizations (ETS, etc.)              attended the conferences. A report of conference activities will be             distributed to a variety of colleges and universities for use in future         counseling and recruitment activities.",
