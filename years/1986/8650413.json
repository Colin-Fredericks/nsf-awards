 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for Eastern Michigan University to                  strengthen and expand the Immunology laboratory curriculum and to give          students experience in utilizing state-of-the-art instrumentation.  The         field of immunology is one of the fastest growing scientific areas;             immunological techniques are used by an ever increasing number of               scientists in a multitude of disciplines.  Because of the wide                  application of immunological methods in biotechnology, a basic                  laboratory course in immunology is fundamental for students in biology,         chemistry, microbiology, immunology and related disciplines.                                                                                                    The equipment needed to implement the curricular revisions include an           inverted phase contrast fluorescent microscope, enzyme immunoassay              reader-spectrophotometer, scintillation counter, laminar flow hood, CO2         incubator, refrigerated centrifuge, and immunoblot membrane filtration          assay system. This equipment will allow EMU's Biology faculty to focus          on current techniques in both the cellular and humoral aspects of the           immune system. Curricular changes will result in an ability to teach            both basic and advanced techniques in one of the most demanding, useful         and interesting areas of science.  The techniques learned will provide a        firm foundation for students seeking advanced courses in basic sciences,        and these methodologies will prove useful for future scientists in              academic or industrial research settings.  This project holds                   considerable promise for helping EMU's Biology Department to make an            important advance in modernizing its curriculum.",
