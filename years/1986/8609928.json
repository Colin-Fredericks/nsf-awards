 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach to electrostatic precipitation is proposed that utilizes         electrostatically charged heavy solid particles which are sustained in          suspension between parallel walls of the precipitator with a dc applied         electric field.  These particles, which are larger by a factor of 102           to 104 then the dust, will scrub a flowing dust laden gas as a result           of impaction and electrostatic attraction to the solid particles.  The          solid particles are continuously swept through the precipitator in a            cross-flow motion relative to the flowing dirty gas and are made to             undergo a self-cleaning action by collision with the boundary wall of           the precipitator where they receive at either of the parallel walls of          the precipitator from the action of the applied electric field.                 Alternatively, the \"dust carrying\" solid particles can be allowed to            pass out of the precipitator for washing while a makeup of clean solid          particles is supplied.  In either case, the process is continuous in a          dc electric field.",
