The Physics Department will buy a pulsed tunable           dye laser system and associated fast, sensitive detection and analysis          apparatus to support the laboratory work in that course.  The students          will study the details of the operation of the four major parts of the          system, the nitrogen pump laser, the tunable dye laser, the amplifier,          and the frequency doubling crystal. Two other courses that will be              enhanced significantly by the equipment are Contemporary Experimental           Physics and Project Laboratory.  In those courses students will perform         laser-based experiments in atomic and molecular physics.",
