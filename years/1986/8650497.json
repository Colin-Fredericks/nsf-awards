 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major modernization of the equipment used to teach techniques of              biochemical research and cellular/molecular biology is being undertaken         by the Biology faculty at Furman University.  The new equipment,                including a modern spectrophotometer, a tabletop ultracentrifuge, high          performance liquid chromatograph, oxygen electrode, state-of-the-art            video densitometer and an ultra-pure water system, are the basis of a           major revision in the way two core courses and several electives are            being taught.  In a five year period, about 250 undergraduates involved         in an average of three to four courses per student will have extensive          hands-on experience with the new equipment.  The project is expected to         result in much better informed students who are experienced in current          laboratory technology.  This will help to increase the number of                students who enter graduate school with good laboratory skills.                                                                                                 In preparation for this project the Principal Investigator visited eight        colleges with excellent reputations in teaching modern biology to               undergraduates, in order to take maximal advantage of curricular                improvements  found there.  As a result, this project incorporates many         of the best current ideas in teaching the chemistry of biological               systems.",
