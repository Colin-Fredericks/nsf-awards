 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will disseminate an elementary science outreach and kits            program through a network of eight museums in Boston, Massachusetts.            The Museum of Science successfully piloted this approach in four                communities in 1984-1985.  The approach involves developing elementary          science kits and conducting teacher training workshops in the use of kit        materials.  Kits emphasize the use of manipulative materials, and               choices of kit topics are based on reviews of curricula and texts in            elementary science, museum strengths in terms of collections, and major         topics that will be represented at the museums.  Each kit is a complete         set of instructional materials, including all supplies required.  Kits          are rented to schools for five weeks for a reasonable fee.  Consumables         are resupplied each time the kit is returned.                                                                                                                   In the effort to expand the program statewide, the Museum of Science,           Boston, will provide development and production of new kits;                    distribution of kits to regional science centers; curriculum development        to accompany kits; central coordination and accounting; development of          workshops accompanying kits; training of staff from other museums.  The         network of museums will provide creative input into the development of          new kits; workshops for teachers in how to use the kits; kit                    distributions to local users; site visitations to assist teachers;              marketing efforts to local communities.",
