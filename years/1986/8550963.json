 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design, implement, and disseminate in-service training        to 67 teachers of grades K-12.  The program will upgrade the teaching           and learning of problem-solving processes and skills.  The Cedar Falls          school district is ideal for the development of a model program:  there         are only six elementary schools, two junior high schools and one high           school in the district, so all teachers can be involved in the program.                                                                                         During the summer of 1986, 26 teachers will attend a four-week workshop.        The principals will attend five of the workshop sessions.  During the           summer of 1987, a second group of teachers will attend the summer               workshop.                                                                                                                                                       During each semester of the following academic year, there will be four         days of released time for in-service work with teachers and teaching.           The participating teachers will be expected to teach problem-solving            skills as a regular, systematic part of their daily classroom                   instruction.  In addition, each of the participating teachers will be           required to conduct an action research project in conjunction with their        teaching.  The Project Team will provide consultive help in the various         classrooms.",
