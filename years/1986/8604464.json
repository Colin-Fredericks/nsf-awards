 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a feasibility evaluation of a new method to evaluate plastic            strains in the interior of solids caused by loading, simple from                measurements of surface displacements.  The measurement may be                  performed by holography, for instance.  Most testing methods are                capable of measuring microstructures, residual stresses, and defects of         materials located near free surfaces.  However, no method is currently          available for measuring plastic deformations in the interior of solids.         The principle of this novel method is based upon an inverse application         of the boundary integral equation method (BIEM).  The body forces due           to plastic strains form the boundary values of displacements and                tractions on interfaces in BIEM.  The body forces can be determined             inversely from the boundary values of displacements.",
