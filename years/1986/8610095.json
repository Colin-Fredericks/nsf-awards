 "awd_abstract_narration": "Incoherent radiation offers a number of advantages over coherent                radiation for many image processing applications.  It inherently gives          a superior signal-to-noise ratio and offers more flexibility.  The              planned research is a continuation of previous NSF supported work               (ECS-8212472) exploring aspects of image processing with incoherent             light.  The image processing operations will be based upon                      interferometry using extended source and polychromatic light.  Work             will concentrate on three major topics:  First is an extension of               incoherent spatial filtering, wherein arbitrary transfer functions are          generated, comparable to those possible with coherent optics.  Second           is a process whereby the image properties, including resolution, are            controlled by a parallel aperture, through which no light from the              object passes.  This prospect leads to superresolution, whereby the             object light passes through a small aperture, yet is not degraded in            resolution.  Third is a new kind of diffraction tomography, based on            the concept of grating imaging with incoherent light.",
