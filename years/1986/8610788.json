 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray lithography will play a significant role in the production of the         next generation of high-density electronic devices, in particular, in           the production of computer memories.  Mask technology has progressed            considerably, but the problem of a source still remains.  A clear trend         has emerged worldwide in favor of the application of Electron Storage           Rings as dedicated XRL sources, because of the sheer X-ray power of             these machines.  Much work still needs to be done before a successful           Synchrotron XRL exposure process is developed.  These include:  the             behavior of masks in the high-power X-ray beam; detailed studies of the         local distortions; multi-level alignment with a successful test                 vehicle; the influences of external factors on the process; and a               complete model describing the exposure tool, from the Synchrotron               source to the development.  The proposed research addresses the points          where this work may make a unique contribution; this is in the area of          exposure process characterization, real-time mask distortion studies,           multi-level alignment techniques and process modelling.  All of this            will be applied to the unifying goal of demonstrating a multi-level             test vehicle at linewidths of 0.25 um.",
