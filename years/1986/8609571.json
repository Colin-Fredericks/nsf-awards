This project will design, develop, and produce a                  prototype data storage and retrieval system which will accomodate pages         of text, line drawings, and continuous tone images.  The system will            accept search requests in the form of a sequence of keywords which can          be associated with one another using logical connectives such as \"and\",         \"or\", \"but not\", etc. and will produce, in response to each request, a          list of the accession numbers, or possible page and word numbers, of            those documents satisfying the request.  The reading system will then           present to the user, on a high resolution display, an image of the              required documents, a page at a time, for review.  Those pages which            appear to be of interest can then be printed on a suitable printer.",
