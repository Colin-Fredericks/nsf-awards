 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deliver in-service training to 30 middle school               teachers in or near Erie, Pennsylvania.  The participants will be               introduced to modern ecological techniques and will also be instructed          in the applications of microcomputers.                                                                                                                          The program will consist of four phases.  Phase I will be a two-week,           full-time workshop during the summer.  Phase II will consist of nine            Saturday workshops during the first semester, and Phase III will consist        of seven Saturday workshops during the second semester.  During these           workshops, the participants will develop Environmental Computer Units to        be incorporated into their courses.  Phase IV will be a four-week               workshop for individual project presentations.                                                                                                                  There will be extensive field trip activity during the first three              phases of the project.  Both Lake Erie and Presque Isle State Park are          accessible for field studies and will be employed as study sites.",
