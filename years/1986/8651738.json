 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of a successful program previously funded        for junior high and high school science and/or mathematics teachers.            Thirty-two teachers will be given the opportunity to develop proficiency        in robotics labs, utilizing these labs and concepts as a classroom              resource. This will be accomplished by holding sessions once a week             during the spring semester and a week-long session in June.                                                                                                     Classroom visitations for purposes of support and observation will be           conducted throughout the spring and again the following fall.  The              outcomes will include heightening the teachers' capabilities in                 articulating \"Hi-tech\" careers for the students in this newly emerging          area of technology. This hands-on, experiential project aims to motivate        and excite the teachers and students to the many possibilities of               technology in their lives.  The intention is to integrate the robotic           technology into the existing science and/or mathematics curricula.",
