 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program is proposed on the application of the theory of              variational enequalitites in equilibrium problems arising in                    transportation theory and economics.  It is hoped that this approach            will simplify the theory of equilibrium and will induce more effective          algorithms for computing equilibria of large scale systems.  Three              specific projects are proposed.  The first project addressed equilibria         in traffic networks.  A travel demand is associated with each                   origin-destination pair of modes of a netowrk.  A travel cost is                assigned to each link of the network.  In the equilibrium traffic               pattern, no user will be ablle to decrease his travel cost by altering          his travel decisions.  This can be characterized by a mathematical              conidition in a form of variational inequality.  The principal                  investigator will establish existence of equilibrium taffic patterns            under weak assumptions, and will develop conceptual algorithms for              finding such equilibria.  The second project aims at developing a new           approach for the study of general economic equilibrium, based on the            theory of variational inequalitites.  The main idea is to show that             Walrasian equilibria can be obtained as solutions to a variational              inequality, in an approporiate space.",
