The overall biochemical characteristics and basic                 reaction kinetics and mechanisms of those enzymes involved in the               biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics and further apply the knowledge         base to be acquired from this research to the improvement of                    fermentation process and/or development of new and direct in-vitro              enzymatic processes for production of existing and novel beta-lactam            antibiotics derivatives.  During the initial phase of the research,             efforts will focus on the purification and characterization of those            key enzymes involved in the ring formation and ring expansion reactions         of beta-lactam antibiotics.",
