These stations are the main instrumentation teaching tools in the               sophomore mechanical engineering instrumentation course, and are central        to student instrumentation work in junior and senior mechanical                 engineering laboratories and in a senior controls course.  A versatile          tool is available for undergraduate students to gain experience with the        intricacies of data collection, analysis and reporting. With the                improved undergraduate laboratory curriculum, students are exposed to a         wider variety of such experiences than was previously possible.",
