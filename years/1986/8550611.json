 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, Lamar University will develop physics                     demonstrations to constitute a \"lending library\" for physics and                physical science teachers in schools located near the University.  Each         packaged demonstration will reinforce a single concept in physics and           will be used to supplement the usual lecture/demonstration format.              Members of the Lamar University physics department will design, build           and maintain the demonstrations, and expect to produce 20 packages              during the period of this project.                                                                                                                              The implementation of the project will be carried out in the frame work         of four components.  (1) the design and construction of self-contained          demonstration packages; (2) the maintenance of these single concept             demonstration packages at Lamar University, to be checked out by area           precollege teachers; (3) the presentation of workshops on the effective         use of the demonstration; (4) follow-up visits to the schools where the         demonstrations are being used.                                                                                                                                  This project is developing an innovative approach to enhancing                  instruction in phyics, an approach with good potential for serving as a         model for other institutions and disciplines.",
