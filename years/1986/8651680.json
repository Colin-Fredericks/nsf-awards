 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a workshop to explore frontiers in molecular biology,        to do laboratory activities that have high potential for inclusion in           regular high school biology courses, and to discuss applications in             biotechnology and their related science-based societal issues.                                                                                                  Thirty-two secondary teachers of biology or chemistry will attend a             five-week summer workshop beginning in July of 1987.  During this               segment of the program, participants will attend lectures, do laboratory        work, participate in seminars given by faculty from 12 different                disciplines, hear guest lectures by representatives from pharmaceutical         and food industries, and observe demonstrations by several scientific           companies of equipment suitable for use in high school biology                  curricula.                                                                                                                                                      Time is set aside each week for teachers to meet as a group to share            experiences and to seek ways to improve course offerings.  Each teacher         will be expected to do laboratory experiments that can be used in the           classroom.  Teachers will be encouraged to publish suitable experiments.",
