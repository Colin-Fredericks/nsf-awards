 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a systematic method for parameter identification for           an assumed system is developed.  The method utilizes both the more              general non-classical modes of vibration and the more restrictive               classical modes of vibration and includes the effect of modal                   interference.  Such a method would provide the most general                     interpretation of vibration test results and would enable engineers to          gain insight into the complex behavior of an arch dam system.  The              method is applied to the recent test results of the three existing arch         dams.  The accuracy of the classical mode formulation and the                   importance of the non-classical modes is critically assessed.  An               effort is also made to develop a method of establishing a                       non-proportional damping matrix from the modal parameters.                      Recommendations are made on vibration test procedures that would yield          more information on the behavior of arch dams than current procedures.",
