 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable                         Dr. Jaxk Reeves of the University of Georgia to conduct                         collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. Masami Hasegawa                   of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo, Japan.                    Using the complete mitochondrial genome of several completely                   sequenced animal species (human, cow, mouse, frog, fruit fly),                  the researchers will apply statistical techniques to obtain                     estimates and standard errors thereof of the long-term                          substitution rates of the elemental DNA bases (A,C,G,T).  In                    addition, they will obtain estimates and standard errors of the                 relative time-distances between various species' branchings.                                                                                                    The approach to be used is novel in that the complete                           mitochondrial DNA genome of five animal species will be used;                   approximately 16,500 base pairs for each.  This will allow the                  researchers to address the questions of whether the rate of                     specific base pair substitution has been approximately constant                 over the millions of years of evolutionary history, and what                    effect position in the sequence has on substitution rates.                      Dr. Hasegawa is an established leader in the application of                     statistics to the field of genetics, and the Institute of                       Statistical Mathematics should prove an ideal environment for                   Dr. Reeves to pursue and expand his research.",
