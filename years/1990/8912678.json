 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Courts of Appeals remain among the least comprehended of                    major federal institutions.  Despite the importance of these                    courts in setting national policy and attention to their role in                a number of particularistic studies, the absence of analytic data               across federal jurisdictions and over large spans of time has                   limited our understanding of judicial decisionmaking and of the                 cases, controversies, and outcomes of issues heard by these                     courts.                                                                                                                                                         Dr. Songer seeks to advance scientific work on the Courts of                    Appeals through the development of a multi-user data base.  The                 resource will focus on the years 1925 through 1989 and include                  both unpublished as well as published decisions.  The sampling                  design calls for approximately 40,000 cases across all twelve                   jurisdictions.  In order to insure the scientific utility of                    these data for many potential users, data on a broad range of                   variables of theoretical significance (e.g., relating to votes,                 decisions, issues, parties, and substance of the dispute) will be               coded.  Substantial attention will be paid to coding reliability.               Also, variables and coding conventions will be compatible with                  existing large-scale data sets on the Supreme Court and the                     federal district courts.  A Board of Overseers comprised of                     active researchers will provide guidance to Dr. Songer in the                   conduct of this work.  The data set will be archived and made                   available through the Inter-university Consortium for Political                 and Social Research at the University of Michigan.                                                                                                              The creation of this data set is a major contribution to the                    field.  With the availability of this data set, new studies will                be possible that might otherwise be too expensive to undertake on               an individual basis, and they can be done with greater rigor and                attention to rival hypotheses.  Also, in conjunction with extant                data on other tiers of courts, this resource will comprise the                  most comprehensive data base ever assembled and permit direct                   comparisons of judicial decisionmaking and behavior across all                  three levels of the federal judicial system.",
