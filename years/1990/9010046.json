 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts a series of human double auction market                   experiments to generate a matching data set for a tournament of                 \"robot traders\" who compete in an artificial double auction market.             The double auction market is a simplified version of the AURORA                 electronic double auction market recently developed by the Chicago              Board of Trade.  Precise comparisons will be made of the behavior               of human and robot traders.  Existing experimental data on human                double auction markets are not directly comparable to the                       computerized market because the latter divides time into discrete               bid-offer and buy-sell steps, and adopts a new institutional                    design, Chicago Rules, that allows only holders of the highest                  outstanding bid or lowest outstanding offer to execute                          transactions.  The project uses the experiments to study the impact             of Chicago rules, the effects of variations in period length in a               market with discrete trading intervals, and the consequences of                 restrictions on the messages that can be transmitted and received               by traders.                                                                                                                                                     The results of this research will improve experimental methods and              our understanding of widely used market institutions.  By matching              human experimental data with the results from the tournament of                 computerized robot traders, the project will be able to provide                 strong tests of the ability of \"artificially intelligent\" agents                to mimic the behavior of human traders in Double-Auction markets.               If computer simulations could complement human experiments, this                would dramatically increase the number and type of experiments that             investigators could use to study the effects of institutional                   changes.  The results of the experiments should also provide new                insights into the performance of double auctions.  This is                      important because the double auction is the type of trading                     institution used by the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Stock              Exchange, and many other securities and commodities exchanges                   throughout the world.",
