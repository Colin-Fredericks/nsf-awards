 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research on level structures for                   Abelian varieties of Professor Peter Norman of the University of                Massachusetts. Dr. Norman's work will involve the problems of                   lifting Abelian varieties from positive characteristic to zero                  characteristic, as well as researches on Hilbert-Blumenthal                     varieties and Dieudonne theory.                                                      This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
