This is a continuation of the course that has been funded               by the National Science Foundation since its inception eight                    years ago. The intention is 1) to teach molecular techniques to                 scientists who are already involved in research with plants so                  that they can bring this orientation to their own future                        research, and 2) to teach key experimental systems in plant                     biology to scientists who are familiar with microbial or animal                 systems and with to work with plants. Lectures in the course are                given by the organizers and by invited lecturers who are working                on current research frontiers, and are leaders in their field.                  Laboratory sessions focus on methods to obtain and characterize                 transgenic plants and to study gene expression. laboratory                      sessions will be taught by the course instructors, and by invited               lecturers who bring their laboratory materials with them.                       %%%                                                                             This course has served has a valuable training opportunity for                  researchers entering the field of plant molecular biology.",
