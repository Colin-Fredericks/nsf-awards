 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently it has become possible to transform a paralyzed radial                 spoke mutant of the bi-flagellate alga Chlamydomonas with the                   wild-type flagellar radial spoke gene, thereby restoring                        flagellar motility.  This transformation system will permit the                 study of many aspects of flagellar protein synthesis, assembly                  and function.  Before carrying out these studies, however, it                   will be necessary thoroughly to describe the transformation of                  Chlamydomonas with flagellar genes.  These initial studies will                 be done using the gene for radial spoke-3 (RSP-3) and the                       paralyzed flagella mutant, pf-14 in which this gene is defective,               causing the lack of radial spokes.  Using both genetic and                      molecular procedures it will be determined how many copies of the               gene are present, whether the genes are integrated into the                     chromosomes and, if so, where the integration occurs.  An effort                will be made to optimize the targeting of the transforming gene                 to its homologue in the cell (homologous recombination). This                   will then make it possible to obtain mutants in radial spoke                    proteins by gene disruption.  Finally, because the efficiency of                transformation of Chlamydomonas is relatively high, additional                  flagellar genes will be cloned by complementation.                                                                                                              Radial spokes, composed of 17 individual proteins are structural                components of flagella, the organelles by which the unicellular                 green alga, Chlamydomonas, swims.  Each of these proteins is                    essential for normal flagellar beating.  Certain mutations                      affecting these proteins result in flagella that lack radial                    spokes and are immotile.  Newly developed techniques for                        genetically transforming Chlamydomonas now make it possible to                  study in detail the roles of the individual proteins in flagellar               motility.  The proposed research represents the first step toward               such studies.  Flagellar beating is one of the mechanisms by                    which cells move.  Understanding the structure, function, and                   interactions of  flagellar proteins is fundamental to our                       understanding of this form of cellular motility.",
