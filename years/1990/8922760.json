 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this mathematical research is on affine                       varieties in the space of several complex variables.  Varieties                 are the locus of points where analytic functions vanish; they                   have many similarities with surfaces.  The object of the work                   concerns the Lojasiewicz inequality for complex polynomials.  The               inequality relates the distance of any complex variable (n-                     dimensional) from the zero locus of an analytic function to the                 value of the function.  In its sharper form, one wants to know                  the highest power of the distance function which can be compared                with the function value, and, instead of a single function, the                 zero set belongs to that of a finitely generated ideal.  If the                 generators are polynomials, then a recent result gives a power in               terms of the product of the polynomial degrees.  A better                       exponent is conjectured depending on whether the number of                      polynomials exceeds the dimension of the underlying space or                    not.  Work will be done to establish the conjecture.                                 A second line of investigation relates to the development                  of a Nevanlinna theory in several variables.  That is, the study                of value distribution theory or the measure of the affinity of                  complex meromorphic functions for complex numbers.  The specific                objects of study are maps from one complex domain to another.                   The components of the maps are polynomials.  This work will                     continue recent investigations into the Jacobian conjecture to                  the effect that if the Jacobian of such a map is unity, then the                map is an automorphism.  While this conjecture may not be settled               for some time, accomplishments of the past year suggest that                    substantial insights may be gained with further research using                  Nevanlinna-type arguments.",
