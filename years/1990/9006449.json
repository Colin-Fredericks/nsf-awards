 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with scientists of Costa Rica's National                  Biodiversity Institute, Drs. Barry Hammel and Michael Grayum of                 the Missouri Botanical Garden are beginning the second phase of                 an extensive inventory of the ca. 12,000 species of ferns,                      conifers, and flowering plants of that tropical country.  This                  second phase is transitional, with continued field collecting in                targeted regions throughout the country and with increasing                     development of computerized databases and of selected                           publications.  One eventual goal is a comprehensive                             identification guide, or manual, in both Spanish and English                    versions, to the plant resources of Costa Rica.                                      Training of host-country students to serve as field                        collectors and \"parataxonomists\" is a novel aspect of the                       enterprise; these individuals usually work in Costa Rica's                      extensive system of national parks and refuges, where they gain                 first-hand knowledge of the flora and fauna.  Reciprocal visits                 between U.S. and Costa Rican botanists, as well as visits by                    contributing European scientists, make this an international                    effort; the parallel exchange of herbarium specimens is helping                 to develop Costa Rica's natural history collections.  The                       current taxonomic inventory and the resulting computer databases                will be of lasting utility to conservation and resource                         management interests, in a country with proven ability to put                   such information to effective use.  The Manual Project, in                      becoming fully integrated with and contributing significantly to                the development of Costa Rica's new Instituto Nacional de                       Biodiversidad, answers the need for urgency in collecting,                      maintaining and distributing biodiversity information.",
