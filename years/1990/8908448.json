 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vocal communication system of birds has long served as a                    model system for the study of vocal communication in general.                   One reason is that the behavior of birds is especially easy to                  study.  Another reason is that avian vocal communication has so                 many similarities to human communication, for example, in                       development and in neural control.                                                                                                                              Progress in studying the function of avian vocal signals has                    recently been aided greatly by the use of a bioassay for                        measuring preferences of female birds for male vocalizations.  In               this bioassay, captive females are first treated with a hormone,                estradiol, and then exposed to playback of recorded                             vocalizations.  Females respond to appropriate vocalizations with               a courtship display, which is used as the response measure.                                                                                                     Dr. Searcy will investigate the hormonal basis of the bioassay by               treating females with different doses of estradiol, measuring                   levels of the hormone in their blood, and relating dose and blood               level to their degree of responsiveness to vocal stimuli.  These                experiments should both advance our understanding of the hormonal               control of reproductive behavior in female birds and lead to                    methodological improvements in the bioassay for female vocal                    preferences.                                                                                                                                                    In a second series of experiments, Dr. Searcy will test the                     effect of loudness of vocalizations on female preferences.  Based               on other investigators' experiments with frogs, theories have                   been proposed to explain why some preferences can be reversed by                changing loudness while others are insensitive to such changes.                 Dr. Searcy will test whether or not these theories can be                       extended to birds, as a step towards unifying the field of                      bioacoustics.                                                                                                                                                   In a third set of experiments, Dr. Searcy will test the ability                 of female birds to sort vocalizations produced by different                     males, using a technique similar to experiments on people's                     discrimination of unfamiliar voices.  These experiments will                    provide another step towards producing theories of vocal                        communication that are general across all animals, rather than                  specific to just one group.",
