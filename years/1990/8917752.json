 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in the study of insect herbivore-plant                  interactions is:  What are the factors responsible for variation                in herbivore density and surviorship among conspecific host                     plants in a population?  Although there are many possible                       mechanisms, variation in host plant resistance and in enemy                     impact are strongly suggested as important by previous work.                    Theory and empirical evidence suggests that interactions between                plant resistance and variable enemy impact among plants may be                  common and important in plant-herbivore systems.  The concept of                three tophic level interactions and the enemy impact hypothesis                 pose three main pathways of interactions between plant resistance               and enemy impact.  The main goal of this research is to determine               the relative importance of these pathways of interaction between                host plant genotype and natural enemy impact in this system.                    Answers to these questions are important to the development of                  theory of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions and to                     understanding the processes that influence population and                       community variation of herbivorous insects among conspecific                    plants.  The experimental program will determine: 1) the                        heritability and correlation of resistances to three herbivores                 on willow, 2) the presence of variation in enemy impact among                   plant genotypes and its correlation with plant resistance, 3) the               relative importance of pathways by which plant genotype or other                herbivore species directly or indirectly affect enemy impact, and               4) the relative importance of several mechanisms of direct and                  indirect competitive interactions between herbivores.  Other                    experiments will examine details of specific pathways of                        interaction between plant genotype, other herbivore species, and                natural enemy impact.",
