 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research                         project involving Professor Raphael M. Ottenbrite, Department                   of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University; Professor                       Michael Sobel, Medical College of Virginia; and Professor                       Junzo Sunamoto, Department of Polymer Chemistry, Kyoto                          University, Japan.  Their past efforts have produced a unique                   approach to delivering antitumor polyanionic polymers by                        using polysaccharide-coated liposomes as masking agents.                        Their research is a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort                     intended to continue to develop new and better polymers which                   will provide less toxic and more active agents, to develop new                  and better liposomes and carriers to improve the biological                     success currently achieved, and finally to evaluate this                        combination immunostimulator and delivery system with in-                       vitro and possibly in-vivo experiments.                                                                                                                         Professor Ottenbrite is well known for his work in the area of                  polymer synthesis.  Professor Sobel is a biochemist with                        expertise in cell membranes and their role in the assimilation                  of materials into the cell.  Professor Sunamoto is an expert                    in the area of liposomal encapsulation.  Their joint efforts                    should result in the development of new knowledge which could                   ultimately lead to viable new methods of immunotherapy.",
