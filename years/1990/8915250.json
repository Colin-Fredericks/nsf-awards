 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Library of Natural Sounds is part of Cornell                           University's Laboratory of Ornithology.  The Library is one of                  two large U. S. collections of animal sounds, mostly bird songs.                These recordings are of the highest quality, and they provide an                unmatched resource for research scientists interested in animal                 behavior.  The Library has an active program for adding new and                 unique recordings to the collection. The collection has an                      international reputation for the diversity and quality of its                   representation of tropical species.  Dr. Christopher Clark,                     Director of the Library, plans continued improvement in the                     services offered to researchers and the recording capabilities                  used in copying and archiving recordings.  New digital tape                     recorders will be added to the Library's studios, allowing                      exploration of this promising new technology.                                        Animal sounds are important components of research projects                in ecology, reproductive biology, behavior, physiology,                         developmental biology, and evolutionary biology.  The Library of                Natural Sounds provides an indispensable service to the research                community by providing a rich and accessible source of high-                    quality recordings.",
