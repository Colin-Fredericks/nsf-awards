 "awd_abstract_narration": "The source of this mathematical research is a conjecture                   made by W. Thurston five years ago to the effect that if one                    packed circles inside planar simply connected domains and then                  associated the circles by a discrete map, then as the circles                   became smaller, the maps would converge to the analytic Riemann                 map between the two domains.  Several proofs of the conjecture                  followed shortly thereafter.                                                         This project continues the study of connections between                    circle packings and analytic functions, with the aim of                         developing a geometrically faithful discrete analogue of parts of               classical function theory.  Initial developments in the                         application of circle packing relied on hexagonal packings.  For                reasons both aesthetic and practical, this restriction is being                 removed. Deeper insights into the fundamental behavior of circle                packings is expected to result from this work.  A departure from                studies of circle packing in the plane to the setting of                        hyperbolic geometry is also leading to new connections between                  combinatorics and geometry.  What has already emerged, for                      example, are hyperbolic analogues for the Schwarz lemma and Pick                lemma in the context of circle packing maps.                                         A new element recently introduced into these studies is that               of using a random walk as a perspective from which to view the                  transition from one packing to the next.  This model shows, for                 instance, how the effects of differential changes in boundary                   radii distribute themselves about the packing.  The precision of                the model is exact, reflecting the profound rigidity in circle                  packings.                                                                            The first and most important goal of this work will be to                  determine the corresponding result of the Mostow rigidity                       theorem: Are infinite circle packings which fill the hyperbolic                 plane unique up to automorphisms?  Work will also be done to                    answer the question of which compact surfaces support circle                    packings.",
