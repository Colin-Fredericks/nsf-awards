 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enabled the institution to acquire a Hewlett-Packard               High Performance Liquid Chromatograph, complete with diode array                and refractive index detectors, PC, monitor, plotter, software                  packages and columns.  They have made extensive use of the                      instrumentation in Organic Chemistry and upper division                         laboratories.  In Organic Chemistry laboratories, students are                  introduced to HPLC techniques of separating natural materials                   such as dopamine and norepinephrine, nucleosides, and                           polypeptides.  Students are also introduced to the determination                of polymer molecular weights by gel permeation phase                            chromatography.  Theory and practice of liquid normal and reverse               phase chromatography are introduced in Analytical Chemistry and                 more fully developed in Instrumental Methods, and Industrial                    Chemistry.  Since significant portions of Advanced Laboratory                   Techniques and student research courses are devoted to the study                of polymers and biomolecules, the instrument finds extensive used               in these laboratories.  In Advanced Laboratory Techniques,                      students prepare a Universal Calibration curve for determining                  molecular weights of polymers and then complete a series of                     experiments from which they may formulate relationships between                 polymer molecular weight, catalyst concentration and                            polymerization temperature.  Several ongoing student research                   projects use this instrument for polymer molecular weight                       determination and for separation and characterization of                        biomolecules, such as nucleotides and nucleosides.                                                                                                              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
