 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Hong H. Lee,                         Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Florida,                      to pursue with Dr. Sang Heup Moon, Reaction Engineering                         Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and                             Technology (KAIST), for a period of 18 months, a program                        of cooperative research on the effects of pore size on                          deactivation of nickel catalysts for benzene                                    hydrogenation.  These catalysts are affected both by                            sintering and coking (poisoning) due to the exothermic                          nature of the reaction.  The objective of the research                          is to determine the effects of pore size on the                                 deactivation rate so that a nickel catalyst can be designed                     for an extended lifetime for the hydrogenation reaction.                                                                                                        In the cooperative project, Dr. Moon will prepare and test                      catalysts of varying support pore size.  Dr. Lee will                           provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of support                         pore size on the sintering of these metal catalysts.                            Because the catalyst is affected both by sintering and                          coking, a determination also must be made as to how much                        of the deactivation is due to sintering in order to                             properly analyze data on catalyst effectiveness.  In                            addition to the importance of the project as a basic                            research study, this research may have important                                applications in industrial catalysis, where the                                 effectiveness of the catalyst is inversely related to the                       extent of sintering.  The collaborators are highly                              respected scientists in the field of this research.  The                        present project will allow them to combine their talents                        and interests for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant                     to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science                         Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                        between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through                        the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                      techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported                      by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
