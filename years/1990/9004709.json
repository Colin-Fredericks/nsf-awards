 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will utilize the loss estimation                                    procedures developed in a previous work in                                      which a Damage Assessment Handbook was also                                     generated.  These methodology will be applied                                   to estimate the damages produced by two                                         consecutive natural disasters occurred some                                     months ago, Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta                                  earthquake.  These two events of a quite                                        different physical nature, will be the test                                     cases providing a unique opportunity for                                        determining the extent and magnitude of                                         economic dislocations and direct losses                                         produced by each of them.  The comparison                                       between these two cases will also validate the                                  effectiveness of the new damage assessment                                      procedure as applied to any natural hazard.                                     Five issues will be addressed:  a) what                                         procedures did agencies follow to estimate                                      direct damages, and what is the quality of the                                  data used; b) using the Damage Assessment                                       Handbook, what were the direct damages and how                                  sizeable were the economic dislocations; c)                                     what were the measures taken to soften the                                      impact of the economic dislocations; d) what                                    was the impact on historical sites and                                          cultural patrimony; and e) what accounting                                      stance (local, state or national) was used.
