 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will support a student of                    cultural anthropology from Southern Methodist University in a                   field study of the informal economy in Martinique, French West                  Indies.  The project will document the importance of informal                   sector income-producing activities by interviewing a sample of                  households, in a poorer as well as a middle class neighborhood,                 about the full range of their economic activities. In addition                  to conducting participant observation in the neighborhoods,                     social networks and life histories will be studied to put the                   information about informal sector activities into context of the                lives of the people.                                                                                                                                            This research is important because the informal economy is a                    significant part of all societies, yet by definition is difficult               to measure.  Increased understanding of the informal economic                   activities of families across the socio-economic spectrum can                   help planners adjust policies to the actual situation in society,               as opposed to the easily measured situation.",
