 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance students' understanding of               how the scientific method is applied to psychological phenomena                 by giving them first-hand experience with principles and methods                of behavioral observation.  This project fits into a larger                     curriculum revision in the department aimed at expanding                        students' exposure to research methods.  High quality videotaping               and computerized event recorders make possible an integrative                   focus on observational methods in biological, developmental,                    comparative, and social psychology laboratory courses.  The                     equipment also enhances laboratory instruction in learning,                     personality, and abnormal psychology.  Students mastery of                      observational skills will facilitate planning and implementation                of senior thesis research.  Furthermore, students acquire                       confidence and expertise in modern methods and instrumentation,                 which better prepares them for graduate study.  The college will                contribute an amount equal to the award.",
