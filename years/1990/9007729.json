 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goals of Dr. Davies' research program are to                          understand the plant response to wounding all the way from the                  initial chemical (or electrophysiological) signal produced by the               wound, through intracellular regulatory mechanisms, to                          alterations in the expression of specific genes responsible for                 the plant's adaptive response.  He has observed that within a few               minutes after a wound, a number of specific messenger RNAs can be               detected, and there is an increase in polysome formation.                       Unexpectedly, however, even though new messages can be detected                 within a few minutes of the wound, overall protein synthesis                    drops by 75%.  Dr. Davies has formulated several alternative                    hypotheses as to mechanisms that might account for this.  One of                the hypotheses is that there is a regulated translocation of                    polysomes from one subcellular site at which they are active, to                another site where they are inactive.  Consistent with this                     possibility is his observation of a shift in the way polysomes                  from wounded and unwounded plants sediment.  After wounding, a                  large fraction of polysomes pellet with larger cellular                         structures.  The short-term goals of this project are to identify               and localize the proteins that are encoded by the wound-                        responsive genes and the polysomes that appear after wounding.                  In particular he will attempt to                                                determine whether the shift in sedimentation properties of the                  polysomes is caused by association with the cytoskeleton.                                                                                                       The question of whether polysome association with the                           cytoskelton is a biologically significant phenomenon has been                   controversial for a long time.  The results of this project will                make a two-fold contribution.  First, they may resolve the long-                standing controversy over whether association of polysomes with                 the cytoskeleton in plant cells occurs under physiological                      conditions (but this is high risk).   Second, the results should                establish the location of polysomes involved in translation of                  wound inducible gene products and so enhance knowledge of the                   translation stage of the wound response.",
