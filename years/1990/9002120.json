The portable system would be housed primarily at                  the University of South Carolina's Belle W. Baruch Institute for                Marine Biology and Coastal Research Field Laboratory, but would                 be available to Baruch Institute scientists, visiting                           investigators, and graduate students for work along the entire                  east coast.  A GPS and GIS and the type requested is required to                answer many basic questions related to spatial variability of                   cophysiological parameters with respect to disturbance, point                   and nonpoint source pollutant impacts, and natural habitat                      gradients.  This technology would enable the PI's to pursue many                new and exciting research directions which have been hindered in                the past by necessary reliance on existing technology                           (traditional costly and time-consuming surveying methods and two                dimensional database management and analytical tools).  In                      addition, the purchase of this instrumentation would allow them                 to address many of the new questions which have resulted from the               Long-Term Ecological Research Program field studies in North                    Inlet. equipment.  Acquisition of this equipment would greatly                  enhance current research and create many new opportunities for                  Baruch Institute scientists and also increase the attraction for                visiting scientists to conduct research at our facility.",
