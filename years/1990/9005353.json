 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pancreas and intestine from the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) will           serve as models for investigating insulin secretion in two diffuse              endocrine systems.  Chrysemys lacks the compact, highly ordered islet           common to most other vertebrates and exhibits (as do other turtles) a           substantial population of intestinal insulin cells a condition which is         virtually unique among vertebrates.                                                                                                                             Constituent pancreatic endocrine cell population will be determined             morphometrically to assess relationships among cell types with respect          to sex, season and distribution within the pancreas.  The Chrysemys             pancreas also will be examined at the ultrastructural level to further          characterize the endocrine cell types using conventional electron               microscopy and EM immunocytochemistry.  The morphological basis for             peptidergic regulation of insulin secretion will be determined                  immunocytochemically at the light and EM level.                                                                                                                 Perifused trypsin-dispersed intestinal mucosa cells enriched for B              cells will be used for characterizing intestinal cell secretory                 function.  Attempts will be made to determine in regulation on                  intestinal insulin secretions in vivo and the proportional                      contribution made by the pancreas and intestine to circulating insulin.                                                                                         Results from these studies will provide important basic information on          insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas and gut of Chrysemys, two         diffuse endocrine systems which are atypical among vertebrates.                 Moreover, these investigations may provide important insights into the          evolution of the vertebrate gastro-entero pancreatic endocrine systems          and into the importance of local (paracrine) regulation of endocrine            function.",
