 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will define the basic mechanisms by which                         surfactants in marine waters affect the rate of gas exchange at                 the air-sea interface.  Surfactants reduce gas exchange by                      altering the hydrodynamic structure of near-surface turbulence,                 and not by the formation of a monomolecular barrier.                            Reductions in gas exchange up to 50% have been observed in a                    variety of samples from synthetic surfactants to phytoplankton                  exudates and this reduction occurs under turbulent flow                         conditions.  This research is aimed at a two step examination                   of the chemical and surface properties of surfactants as they                   relate to gas exchange processes.  First, an experimental model                 relating the gas exchange coefficient Kw to the surface                         dilational modulus  , the Schmidt number Sc and the friction                    velocity U*w, will be explored in a laboratory wind-wave tank.                  Second, the surface and organic chemistry of marine                             phytoplankton exudates will be described in relationship to                     their retarding effect on gas exchange.  The overall results                    should improve our understanding of how surfactants of biogenic                 origin influence physical processes such as gas exchange in the                 ocean.",
