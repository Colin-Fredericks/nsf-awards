 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an anthropology graduate student who will               study low birth weight in a high altitude region of India.                      Children born at high altitudes in South America and the US have                been observed to weigh significantly less than low-altitude                     children.  This project will see if a similar relationship exists               in India and try to explain variations in child health by                       reference to socio-economic and other cultural factors.  A sample               of 300 pregnant women will be followed and their newborn infants                weighed and measured at several intervals after birth.  In                      addition survey interviews will assess each mother's reproductive               history, socio-economic background, and knowledge and beliefs                   about child health.                                                                                                                                             This research is important because understanding the causes of                  low birth weight an be of help in the design of measures to                     improve the health of such children.  Comparative data such as                  this project will be helpful in testing theories of the causes of               low birth weight.",
