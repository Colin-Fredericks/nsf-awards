 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic type I topoisomerase (topo I), by virtue of its                      ability to introduce transient nicks into double-stranded DNA,                  has been hypothesized to provide temporary swivels for such                     processes as DNA replication, transcription, and possibly DNA                   recombination.  The objectives of this proposal are to use a                    combination of genetics and biochemistry to identify the                        functional domains of the topo I protein and to elucidate the                   biological role of the enzyme in the mammalian cell.  A cDNA                    corresponding to the human topo I mRNA is available and serves as               the starting point for many of the proposed studies.  Experiments               are designed to introduce specific mutation into the topo I gene                with the aim of identifying the minimum region required for                     enzyme activity.  It is possible that these experiments will, in                addition, functionally distinguish the sensitivity to the drug                  comptothecin from the catalytic activity.  The possibility that                 the N-terminal portion of the protein is important for targeting                the enzyme to the nucleus and for the association with other                    nuclear proteins that direct its function in vivo will be                       investigated.  Experiments are proposed to explore further the                  basis for the preferential association of the enzyme with                       replicating SV40 DNA.  Using technology developed in the SV40                   system, the nature and basis for the association of the enzyme                  with cellular DNA will be investigated.  The long range goal of                 these studies is to understand the relationship between the                     structure of the topo I protein and its role or roles in the                    cell.",
