 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus upon porous polymeric materials                        exhibiting a uniform sub-micron cell size which show great                      promise in applications such as membranes, catalyst supports,                   artificial skin, etc.  Current liquid-based phase separation                    technologies for producing these materials are limited be                       difficulties in solvent removal and structural heterogeneity                    introduced by thermal gradients.  It is proposed to generate                    uniform, cellular polymeric materials via a micro-phase                         separation induced in a polymer network swollen by a                            supericrtical fluid.  By taking advantage of the strong                         dependence of solvent power on pressure, a unique                               characteristic of supercritical fluids, one can assume finer                    control over the microstructure in porous materials than is                     presently available using conventional liquid solvents.                                                                                                         The research program will be divided into two phases.  In the                   first, the equilibrium swelling composition and the relaxation                  behavior of a polymer network exposed to supercritical CO2                      will be measured using a quartz spring microbalance and                         dielectric spectrometer, respectively.  These will be the                       first such measurements on a network/supercritical fluid                        system.  In the second phase, microporous materials will be                     generated via a phase separation in a supercritical fluid-                      swollen network.  Porosity will be measured using conventional                  techniques and correlated with the fundamental thermodynamic                    information compiled during the initial program phase.",
