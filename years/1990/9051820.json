 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is modernizing and expanding the laboratory component              of an introductory course, Physics of Light and Color.  This course             is designed to provide both a quantitative and qualitative                      understanding of light, color and visual phenomena to students whose            chosen professions make extensive use of these concepts and                     techniques.  Such professions as graphic arts, fine art, photography,           science education and others increasingly require knowledge of                  diverse optical processes and phenomena as computer generated                   additive color mixing and holography.  This project permits                     acquisition of modern spectrophotometers with reflectance                       accessories.  Two color graphics processors are being used for                  generating up to 256 colors.  Five holography kits allow creation               and examination of holographic images.  Using such equipment students           obtain hands-on experience and develop a deeper understanding of the            scientific and technological aspects of color processes and                     holography.  This understanding and appreciation are enhanced by the            use of up-to-date, easy to use, reliable instrumentation.  The                  University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
