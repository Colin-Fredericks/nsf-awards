 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigators will study                     various problems in the mathematical theory of continuum                        mechanics.  In particular, they will investigate the well-                      posedness of certain boundary value problems that describe the                  flows of visco-elastic fluids and the free-surface flows of                     Newtonian fluids such as water.  These are difficult problems                   that involve \"open\" inflow and outflow boundaries, and the nature               of the boundary conditions determine the well-posedness of the                  problem.  A precise determination of the types of boundary                      conditions that lead to well-posed problems is one of the major                 goals of the research.                                                               The behavior of many fluids in nature is very often a direct               result of the state of the fluid and the forces acting upon it                  along the boundary of the flow regime.  These so-called boundary                conditions can be of many different types, but only the                         physically relevant ones are of interest to scientists and                      mathematicians.  In a mathematical context a physically relevant                boundary condition is one that leads to a unique solution of the                underlying system of differential equations.  With this award the               researchers will study what types of physically relevant boundary               conditions are possible in various flows of ordinary fluids like                water and more complicated visco-elastic fluids.",
