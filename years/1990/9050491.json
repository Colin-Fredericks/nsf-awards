 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics department is equipping introductory physics laboratories           with microcomputer data acquisition and analysis equipment at each              lab station.  The goal is to enhance the experimental component of              the introductory courses by increasing the diversity of phenomena               which can be studied, improving the efficiency with which data can              be taken, and allowing the instructor to tailor the teaching of a               particular experiment to the level of the students involved.  At the            lowest level, software written by the instructor guides the students'           interaction with the experiment.  At a higher level, students write             portions of the software needed to control the experiment.  This                exposure to computer interfacing prepares the students for their                advanced laboratory experiences in which similar equipment and                  techniques are used.  The equipment includes sixteen digital                    mulitmeters with IEEE-488 interfaces and sixteen MS-DOS compatible              personal computers with IEEE-488 digital input/output, analog-to-               digital input and digital-to-analog output interfaces.  All computers           are connected in a Local Area Network, run by a single file server              equipped with a fast, high-capacity hard drive.  Software is being              written in standard, high-level programming languages.  The college             is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
