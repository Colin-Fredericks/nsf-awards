Technology-Informed Mathematics Education for Underrepresented Students         (TIME for US) serves as a school-year bridge between the annual summer          institutes on The Ohio State University's Columbus campus for talented,         low-income, students from nine Ohio cities.  The project provides               school-year mathematics enrichment, career exploration, and mentor              activities for 400 students in their own communities.  Each participant         is matched with a college-educated mentor and a local college student,          and in monthly sessions throughout the school year students experience          the excitement of mathematics through calculators, computers, hands-on          activities, and career exploration field trips.",
