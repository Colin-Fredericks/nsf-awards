 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently it has become clear from a variety of field observations               that downstream size decrease in aggrading river systems is caused              in large part by selective deposition of coarse clasts.  However,               sorting by selective deposition has never been studied                          systematically under controlled conditions.  The absence of a set               of reference data on downstream sorting is even more striking in                light of the number of theories that have been advanced recently                to explain it.  The main goal of the proposed project is to carry               out a series of basic experiments on selective transport and                    deposition in poorly sorted gravelly sediments.  Most of the                    experiments will be conducted in a large channel at the St. Anthony             Falls Hydraulic Laboratory.  There we will produce deposits from                a poorly sorted sand-gravel mix over a distance of about 50 m.  The             main variables will be rate of sediment feed (and hence                         deposition), and channel form (straight, weakly sinuous, braided).              In addition we will make detailed measurements of sediment                      transport and surface texture in a smaller flume at Johns Hopkins               University.  These data will be used to develop surface-based                   transport formulas that will be used in modeling the sorting                    observed in the large flume.",
