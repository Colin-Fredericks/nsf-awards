 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Henry Bunn, Professor of Anthropology                at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Mr. Christopher O'Brien                will collect data for his doctoral dissertation thesis.  He will                spend twelve months in northern Tanzania and work with a group of               Hadza speaking hunters and gatherers to collect a large series of               faunal remains.  At the end of this period, he should have teeth                from a number of different species and these should span the                    yearly range of environmental variation.  He will then section                  these specimens to examine the annuli or incremental growth                     structures which are characteristic of mammalian species and to                 determine the relationship between the development of these                     annuli and seasonality.  Extensive research has demonstrated that               in temperate environments with well defined summer and winter                   seasons, a clear relationship exists between seasonality and                    annuli development.  On this basis, it is possible for                          archaeologists to examine sites which contain fauna, section                    teeth, and determine the times of year they were occupied.  It is               not known, however, whether such a relationship exists among                    tropical species, and Mr. O'Brien postulates that in areas such                 as Tanzania which have alternating rainy and dry periods, annuli                development may also be seasonally determined.  The large series                collected should allow him to examine this hypothesis on a                      species by species basis.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  The technique,                 if it works, will prove a valuable tool useful not only to                      archaeologists but to biologists as well.  From an                              anthropological perspective, it would prove particularly                        important because it would shed light on the behavior of early                  hominids who populated eastern Africa several million years ago.                Remains of butchered animals have been recovered from many sites                in this region.  The project is also important because it will                  assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
