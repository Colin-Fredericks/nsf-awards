 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main theme of this research is the development of semistate design          theories for microelectronic circuit realization.  The theories are             oriented toward applications in areas where the proposers have                  particular expertise, such as coordinated arm control circuits for knot         tying robots, neural-type hysteretic microsystems, soliton circuits for         noiseless signal processing, and Kemp echo simulators for noninvasive           determination of ear parameters.                                                                                                                                The semistate description is ideal for characterizing microelectronic           systems, since semistate equations simultaneously incorporate dynamic           and nondynamic descriptions and microelectronic systems involve dynamics        through capacitive effects and nondynamics through resitive-controlled          source effects.  There is now a large literature on the analysis of             semistate described systems with particular reference to solution of the        resulting equations.  However, very little is available in the area of          design of semistate described systems.  This research deals with the            development of design theories, especially in the areas where the full          power of the semistate comes into play, including hysteresis and knot           oscillators.  The theories are oriented toward the above mentioned              applications.",
