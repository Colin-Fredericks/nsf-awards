 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bryant proposes to continue his analysis of the                             lethal(1)discs large-1 (l(1)d.lg-1) locus, and oncogene of                      Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in this locus cause neoplastic               transformation of the imaginal tissue leading to an extended                    larval life and a block in pupariation. Other alleles allow                     normal imaginal growth but interfere with differentiation during                metamorphosis. His initial genetic and molecular characterization               of the locus has revealed the presence of at least three                        complementation groups and a complex pattern of expression of the               l(1)d.lg-1 transcripts. Sequencing of partial cDNAs indicates                   that the locus encodes at least two different peptides, one of                  which appears to be transmembrane. Database homology searches                   have shown that the predicted l(1)d.lg-1 proteins contain the src               homology region 3 or A-box. This amino acid motif has been found                in several of the vertebrate oncogenes and can regulate the                     transforming ability of these proteins. Dr. Bryant plans to                     isolate full length cDNAs for the l(1)d.lg-1 transcripts to                     determine the sequence of the entire protein. He will also use                  these cDNAs to make minigene transformation constructs to                       correlate the genetic and molecular results. He will make                       antibodies to each of the predicted peptides to use for                         localization and biochemical characterization. Finally he will                  attempt to analyze the function of the A-box by sequencing this                 region from the pre-existing alleles of l(1)d.lg-1 and by                       creating specific alterations in this domain using in vitro                     mutagenesis. The results from these experiments should reveal how               mutations in the l(1)d.lg-1 oncogene can cause neoplastic                       transformation and should help clarify the relationship of this                 gene to the vertebrate oncogenes.                                               %%%                                                                             This study will yield information about the regulation of a gene                involved in growth control during development in Drosophila. This               gene has homologies to mammalian genes involved in the                          transformation to malignant growth.",
