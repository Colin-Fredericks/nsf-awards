As a model system, the P.I. is                   studying the contribution of the transcriptional enhancer of a                  replication competent mouse retrovirus, the Moloney murine                      leukemia virus.  There are multiple binding sites for host                      nuclear transcription factors on the Moloney virus enhancer.  One               of these binding sites, the Leukemia Virus fact b (LVb) site is                 the most highly conserved sequence in the enhancers of mammalian                type C retroviruses.  There is indication that a protein(s) that                binds the LVb site contributes significantly to the pathogenesis                of the Moloney virus.  Dr. Speck plans to characterize, purify                  and obtain molecular clones encoding the nuclear DNA-binding                    protein that binds to the LVb site in the Moloney virus enhancer,               and most likely to the enhancers of many mammalian C-type                       retroviruses.",
