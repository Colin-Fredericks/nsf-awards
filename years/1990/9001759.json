 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two broad aims of this research are to determine (1) the pathways               followed by sugars manufactured in the photosynthesizing cells                  (mesophyll cells) of the leaf to the food-conducting cells (sieve-tube          members) of the leaf veins, and (2) the sites at which the sugars are           actively secreted, or loaded, and unloaded in mature (source) and               immature (sink) leaves, respectively.  Detailed structural studies,             with light and electron microscopes, are complemented by experimental           studies, including localization of 14C-labeled sugars within the leaf           by microautoradiography; plasmolysis studies designed to determine the          solute (primarily sugar) concentrations of the various cell types; and          the use of fluorescent dyes to determine whether substances move from           cell to cell via cytoplasmic connection in their walls (symplastic              movement), via the cell wall continuum (apoplastic movement), or a              combination of the two.                                                                                                                                         The results of these studies will be of long-term practical importance          in relation to crop productivity and will be of great value to                  investigators interested in relations of viruses, insects, mycoplasmas,         and other parasites, and in the movement of insecticides and growth             regulating substances in cultivated plants.  Barley, maize, and                 soybean, species to be studied, are economically important plants.",
