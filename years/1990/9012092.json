 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David Gillette, the State Paleontologist of Utah, is                   currently involved in the excavation of \"Seismosaurus\", an as-yet               undescribed sauropod dinosaur discovered in central New Mexico.                 Current estimates suggest that this individual may measure 140'                 in length, roughly half again as long as the largest known                      dinosaur.  This well-preserved specimen is the first articulated                sauropod dinosaur discovered in many decades, and study of the                  specimen, once excavated, will shed new light on the size limits                on terrestrial animals.  Excavation of this dinosaur skeleton has               been aided by several new remote sensing techniques (ground-                    penetrating radar, scintillation counting, magnetometry, and                    seismic diffraction tomography), under development at Los Alamos                National Lab.  These exploration tools are being developed to                   help locate buried containers of toxic waste and other hazardous                materials, and the only way to test their accuracy and                          reliability is to excavate the dinosaur.                                             The proposed excavation has the potential for profound                     impact on our understanding of dinosaurs, and the size limits of                terrestrial life.  The project may have the added benefit of                    helping efforts to dispose of hazardous waste materials.",
