 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors P. J. Hirschfeld and K. A. Muttalib              of the University of Florida to maintain collaborative research                 links with Dr. Peter Woelfle of the Institute for Condensed Matter              Theory of the University of Karlsruhe, Federal Republic of Germany.             They plan to investigate superconductivity and magnetism using the              single band Hubbard model, which is possibly relevant to materials              with high superconducting transition temperatures (\"high-Tc                     materials.\")  They will apply two new methods that they recently                developed: 1) a new functional integral approach, and 2) a conserving           slave boson diagrammatic expansion, to study several questions                  related to the possibility of superconductivity in Hubbard-like                 systems, the stability of the Fermi liquid state in the presence of             strong correlations, and the stability of incommensurate antiferro-             magnetic phases.  They will also study models of unconventional                 superconductivity, with an emphasis on the question of how the                  symmetry of an unconventional order parameter can be determined                 with external probes, particularly electromagnetic ones.                                                                                                        Although the mechanisms responsible for pairing in the high                     temperature superconductors remain mysterious even after two years              of intense research since its discovery, there is accumulating                  evidence that electronic correlations, rather than electron-phonon              interaction play a crucial role.  Unfortunately, there is no                    adequate systematic and controlled method available for dealing                 with such strongly correlated systems.  New methods such as those               being used here are essential for the study of all highly correlated            Fermi systems, and should be generally applicable to any similar                model, including that appropriate for the high-Tc materials.  These             novel methods originated as a result of extensive collaboration among           these scientists when Dr. Woelfle spent several years at the                    University of Florida.  Continuing the interaction should prove to              be very productive and mutually beneficial.",
