The study consists of three                                   parts:  1) a detailed compilation of the                                        structural and other damages to historic                                        buildings; 2) the identification of the steps                                   taken by managers and owners of cultural                                        property to reduce vulnerability; and 3) the                                    effectiveness of the preparedness plans,                                        organizational arrangements and response                                        capabilities used in the emergency response,                                    salvage and recovery operations, before and                                     after the hurricane.  The identification and                                    assessment of the measures taken in this case                                   which resulted in the effective mitigation of                                   damages will benefit those responsible for                                      cultural property in other disaster prone                                       areas with these measures serving as models.",
