 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epistemology is the philosophical theory of knowledge--what                     knowledge is and how we come to possess it.  It has been the                    traditional concern of epistemology to say, in some general                     way, by what principles the opinions and beliefs of a rational                  person ought to be constrained.  Epistemology has drawn for                     these constraining principles from reflections on metaphysical                  matters, investigations of the context of justification of a                    theory, observations concerning the actual practice of inquiry                  or investigations into cognitive processes exemplified by                       human inquirers.  In this research project, Dr. Kaplan is                       investigating how Bayesian decision theory, a theory that says                  something general and informative about when it is rational                     to prefer one gamble to another, is essential for a theory of                   epistemology that says something general and informative about                  when it is rational to invest more confidence in one                            hypothesis than another.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Kaplan aims to explain why the central result of Bayesian                   decision theory constitutes a genuine and important                             contribution to epistemology.  To do this, he is presenting                     a new argument for the claim that rational confidence is a                      probabilistic affair.  Given this argument, the very                            intelligibility of the talk about belief, acceptance and                        knowledge becomes doubtful.   Dr. Kaplan offers an                              intelligible reconstrual of acceptance and belief that enables                  a Bayesian epistemology to resolve difficulties for theories                    of rational belief and acceptance that are intractable outside                  of a Bayesian framework.",
