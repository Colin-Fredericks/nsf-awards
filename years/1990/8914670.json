 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to develop computing infrastructure for a           wide variety of research with the primary areas being:  plausible               ascription of beliefs by an AI system; complex symbolic information             processing in connectionist systems; associative network databases for          computer vision; the Model Generative Reasoning system; and parallel            algorithms for scene model generation.  The new infrastructure includes         the upgrading of a parallel processor from a 4 processor system to a 22         processor system, the acquisition of a number of workstations, and the          provision of hardware and software technicians.                                                                                                                 In the Beliefs/Metaphor project on natural language discourse                   understanding, two complementary approaches to integrating the                  processing of metaphors and the processing of information about                 participants'belief are being explored.  In one approach, metaphors are         processed by a simple extension of the belief-reasoning machinery in an         existing program, whereas the other approach bases the representation           of belief states on common-sense metaphorical models of mind that are           often exploited in discourse.                                                                                                                                   In the Connectionism project, connectionist information-processing              techniques are being developed that are useful in high-level cognitive          tasks, such as natural language understanding and common-sense                  reasoning, as opposed to the perceptual and adaptation tasks to which           most connectionist work has been directed.  Part of the work is                 exploiting signal timing effects that occur in networks inspired by             real biological neural networks.                                                                                                                                The purpose of the vision database project is to design, implement, and         test a database (appropriate for robotics applications) which supports          associative organization and retrieval, clustering by physical                  properties, higher levels of abstraction, and efficient search for              matching entities.  The paradigm used is an extension of Pathfinder             networks (originally intended to model human semantic memory) called            monotonic search networks, which is a type of proximity graph.                                                                                                  Model Generative Reasoning is a general automated problem solving               system developed by Coombs and Hartley.  It makes expert problem                solvers robust in the light of conflicting evidence through the                 maintenance of alternative hypotheses in a proper abduction/deduction           cycle.                                                                                                                                                          In the Parallel Algorithms for Scene Model Generation project, time-            varying imagery based on natural scenes is being analyzed with the goal         of developing dynamic three-dimensional models of the scenes.                   Important features of the work include a hypothesis-and-test paradigm           for construction of the models, merging of multiple cues through the            use of local consistency constraints, and maintenance of model                  consistency in a parallel environment through data locking protocols            developed automatically from graph grammar productions.",
