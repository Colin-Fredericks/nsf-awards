 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms as diverse as plants and primates respond                        differentially toward conspecifics according to their genetic                   relatedness.  Differential treatment of kin is critical to                      current theories of the evolution of altruism and mate choice.                  Yet, in surprisingly few systems have investigators identified                  the selective factors responsible for the evolutionary                          maintenance of kin-biased behavior.  For anuran tadpoles, the                   predominant view is that associating with relatives is kin-                     selected because these relatives thereby accrue benefits through                increased growth or predation avoidance.  Recent work, however,                 suggests that kin associations may reflect selection to associate               with the natal site (philopatry), and perhaps not with kin per                  se.  A series of field and laboratory experiments will be                       proposed, aimed at elucidating the adaptive significance of                     aggregation behavior in tadpoles.  Specifically, this study                     proposes to determine whether 1) DNA fingerprinting reveals                     evidence of philopatry, 2) aggregation formation is advantageous,               and 3) aggregation formation is context-dependent.  The latter                  two issues will be addressed by conducting field experiments in                 natural ponds.  This study will clarify the selective factors                   favoring kin association behavior in tadpoles and, by                           implication, in certain other gregarious organisms.  Examination                of context-dependent behavior provides opportunity to evaluate                  the role of assessment in evolutionary biology.",
