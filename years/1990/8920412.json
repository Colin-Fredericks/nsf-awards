 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the predictability of pile behavior installed              by vibration process, using ground penetration response and static              performance of piles.  Interest in this problem is motivated by the             fact that the use of vibratory drivers can significantly increase               the rate at which piles can be installed in certain soils relative              to impact hammers, with less damage to piles, but that use in                   restricted by the unavailability of a utilitarian predictive model.             The proposed project will extend an ongoing experimental study to               focus on a systematic evaluation of the fundamental mechanism of                the installation of piles by vibration and to code that information             in a computer program, written for the microcomputer.  The computer             program will predict the behavior and static capacity of vibrator-              installed piles in sands and allow practitioners to study the                   effects of the variables of the problem on driving.  With increased             confidence in the predictability of pile performance offered by                 this study, it is envisaged more piles at substantial savings will              be driven by vibration where subsurface conditions are appropriate.",
