 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic materials (including thin film metallization,                        semiconductors, and high temperature superconductors) will                      continue to play a dominant role in our nation's technological                  development for the foreseeable future.  Dartmouth graduates have               played leading roles in these developments in the past.  These                  improvements will ensure our students have the superior training                needed to continue to command leadership positions.  Measurement                of electronic materials will be enhanced first by purchase of an                ellipso-meter to characterize thin films fabricated in the                      materials laboratories.  Second, existing capacitance-voltage                   measurement capability will be upgraded to a cost-effective,                    state-of-the-art system.  Third, development of a new course in                 optical properties of materials will be enhanced by construction                of a photon measurement system with high sensitivity and                        spectrographic capability.  Finally, teaching of the electronic                 and mechanical properties of materials will be improved by a                    pilot enhancement to our existing workstation-based computer                    laboratory, Project NORTHSTAR.  A Silicon Graphics workstation                  will be used to develop pilot software to display the energy band               structure or mechanical stress properties of a material, based on               a user-supplied solid-state crystal structure and user-selected                 physical models.",
