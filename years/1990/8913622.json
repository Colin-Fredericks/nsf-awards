 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support collaborative research between Dr. Arthur                Fontijn, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Dr. G. Dorth,                    Laboratory of Photophysics and Photochemistry, University of                    Bordeaux, France.  The objective of the research is to carry out                crossed molecular beam experiments, which will allow the investi-               gators to study isolated chemical reactions and to determine                    precisely the threshold energy level necessary for the reactions                to proceed.                                                                                                                                                     Knowledge of gas-phase reactions of radicals of refractory                      elements is of fundamental interest, and is required for the                    modeling of practical problems including many aspects of combustion,            chemical vapor deposition and upper atmospheric chemistry.  Yet,                because of the difficulties inherent in obtaining adequate                      concentrations of such species, their reactions have been measured              by few investigators and most studies made concern near room-                   temperature kinetics.  In the proposed program, selected reactions              of \"refractory radicals\" will be studied by two complementary                   approaches.  Their kinetics will be measured in the 300 - 1800 K                range by the unique HTFFR ( high-temperature fast-flow reactor)                 and/or HTP (high-temperature photochemistry) techniques at                      Rensselaer.  Their dynamics will be investigated by the equally                 unique pulsed crossed supersonic molecular beams (with laser                    evaporation of the refractory species) technique in Bordeaux.  The              excitation functions from the dynamics measurements will be                     converted to rate coefficient versus temperature plots using                    absolute values from the kinetics work and thus allow, for single               channels, extrapolation of the kinetic results to wider temperature             ranges.  The kinetic work involves reactants in thermal equilibrium             excitation states, while the dynamics studies yield state-to-state              information.  Differences in results can reveal important second                channels, such as are attributable to vibrational excitation.  The              accurate determination of the reaction energetics in Bordeaux will              provide an invaluable aid to the interpretation of the Rensselaer               results for reactions, such as those of the alkaline earth atoms,               where these data are not adequately known.",
