 "awd_abstract_narration": "In April, 1987, the United Nations Environment Program                     issued a report that was published under the title of \"Our Common               Future\".   This report, known as the Brundtland Report in honor                 of the committee's chairman, calls for a new world economic                     order, designed around the concept of sustainable development.                       In a project sponsored by the International Association for                Ecology, Dr. Golley and Stenseth propose to conduct a workshop on               the environmental implications of the Brundtland report.  The                   workshop will deal with three areas: 1) management of the                       environment as a commons, 2) the environmental consequences of                  further human population growth, and 3) the interaction between                 ecology and economics.  The conference will be held in a facility               in Norway and will be partially supported by the Norwegian                      National Science Foundation.                                                         The International Association for Ecology has actively                     pursued the international collaboration of scientists for the                   benefit of mankind.  This workshop will provide an unusual                      opportunity for scientists concerned about the environment to                   provide input to global decision making at a decisive moment.",
