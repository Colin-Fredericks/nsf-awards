 "awd_abstract_narration": "A self-contained non-recirculating dilution refrigerator is the hub             of a modern low temperature laboratory facility suitable for                    undergraduates.  The refrigerator gives students the ability to                 perform dramatic experiments dealing with many contemporary                     research topics, such as quantum mechanical tunneling, quantum Hall             effect, quasiparticle dynamics, and the behavior of mesoscopic                  systems.  In addition, the design of experimental apparatus for the             machine allows students to use the physical concepts introduced in              formal coursework:  temperature and thermometry, heat capacity,                 blackbody radiation, and thermal conductivity.  The principal users             of the equipment are junior-year honors students and senior-year                physics students participating in an advanced laboratory program.               By providing a rich, up-to-date research laboratory experience for              students, the project is broadening their exposure to contemporary              topics and experimental techniques, thereby preparing them better               for graduate study and/or industry.  The refrigerator also captures             the interest of younger physics majors, and so provide a powerful               incentive for early participation in research and further study in              physics.  The college is matching the award with an equal amount                of funds.",
