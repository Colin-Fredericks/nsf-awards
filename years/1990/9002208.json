 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides funds to the Asian                          Cultural Council (ACC) to support research of scholars                          selected under the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Education and                     Culture.  Eight awardees will come from a wide range of                         scientific fields in the social and physical sciences, and                      will work with counterparts in India.  Funds from this grant                    are used for travel expenses and costs related to the                           scholars' research projects, and to pay for stipends for                        awardees.  The ACC scientific committees select nominees for                    submission to NSF, which makes the final technical evaluation                   of awardees.  Past awardees have been engaged primarily in                      social and behavioral sciences, with some in the geological                     and few in physical sciences.  The funds provided include                       U.S. $15,000 to cover part of the ACC administrative work                       costs.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  Collaboration between U.S. and Indian scientists is                     clearly demonstrated in this project.  The ACC representative                   office in India obtains the necessary clearances for the U.S.                   scientists to be affiliated with various Indian academic and                    research institutions.  They also manage the logistics                          associated with the travel of the scientists, and his/her                       family when appropriate, shipping of research material into                     and out of India, as well as language training, and assisting                   with research arrangements.  Past performance under similar                     awards was judged by NSF staff and the U.S. scientific                          community as being excellent.
