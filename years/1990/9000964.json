 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropologists have long recognized that the African apes,                of all primates, are most similar to humans.  A significant                     shared derived feature of these animals is their unique knuckle-                walking locomotion. A major gap in our knowledge of such                        locomotor patterns includes the morphological correlates which                  would allow identification of such patterns from the fossil                     record.  The primary objective of this research is to evaluate                  the functional relationship between kinematic patterns of                       knuckle-walking locomotion and the associated morphological                     features of the forelimb in adult and young African apes.  This                 will be accomplished using two dimensional kinematic analysis,                  analysis of weight distribution between fore and hindlimbs using                pressure sensitive paper, and quantitative analysis of                          morphological features of forelimb postcrania in interspecific                  and ontogenetic comparisons.  Results from this research will                   document the allometric variation in movement patterns and                      associated knuckle-walking morphology.  Such a study is essential               to account for allometric effects in the reconstruction of                      locomotor behavior from skeletal material of fossil apes and                    hominids.",
