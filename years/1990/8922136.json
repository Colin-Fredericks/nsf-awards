 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Gerald Schubert of UCLA to collaborate in               astronomy research with Dr. Tilman Spohn of the Institute of Planetology        of the University of Muenster, Federal Republic of                              Germany.  They are working to develop new models of the inner                   structure, mantle dynamics and the thermal and chemical evolution of            Mars.  Dr. Spohn has developed a program for the computation of self-           consistent planetary models, which include the pressure dependence of           the thermal expansion coefficient.  Dr. Schubert has a three-                   dimensional convection program applicable to Mars and access to Cray            computers.                                                                                                                                                      Recent and planned missions of the USA and USSR have moved Mars to the          center of interest in planetology.  Current models of Mars are almost           ten years old and no longer reflect today's knowledge of the                    thermodynamics and high pressure physics of terrestrial planetary               material, the age of the Martian crust and core, and tectonics.                 Preliminary calculations by the collaborators suggest significant               revisions to previous models.  The models they are developing should            be of relevance to questions concerning the formation of Mars and its           evolution, the interpretation of magnetic field data from future                missions to Mars, and cosmogonic and cosmochemical considerations of            the structure and evolution of the solar system.",
