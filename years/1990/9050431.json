 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department is acquiring instrumentation which provide               students in the Optics Concentration with hands-on exposure to the              principles and application of optical crystallography above and                 beyond the level normally discussed in undergraduate optics and solid           state physics courses.  The department is purchasing a temperature              controlled fluid bath, a polarizing microscope, crystal models, a               high voltage power supply and crystal polishing equipment.  These               instruments allow students to grow high quality water-soluble                   crystals and to characterize their optical properties.  It enables              them to construct and study a Glan-Thompson polarizer, a nonlinear              frequency doubler and an electro-optic modulator.  This project is              singificant because it brings to the undergraduate laboratory more              extensive exposure to the properties of birefringent nonlinear and              electro-optic crystals.  These materials are currently the object of            a great deal study in graduate, government, and industrial research             laboratories.  The project enables devices constructed from them at             an earlier stage of their careers.  Finally, it serves other                    institutions through the publication of student lab experiments which           are being developed.",
