 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study index problems for                   first-order singular operators which have specified form near                   singular strata.  This class of operators includes classical                    geometric operators with Dirac signatures and those having conic                type strata.  The main tool to be exploited in this investigation               is the \"wedge calculus\" and its extension to pseudomanifolds.                        For most of the twentieth century operators with various                   types of singular sets have been the mainstay of theoretical                    physics.  Earliest of these was one first studied by Dirac.  This               operator had the property that while it was zero everywhere                     except at a single point, its integral, or the area under its                   graph, was positive.  At first such operators used by physicists                had no sensible mathematical explanation.  But eventually                       mathematicians were able to explain them by changing the context                of their original interpretation.  The principal investigator                   will analyze a large set of operators which includes Dirac's.",
