 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has developed a side-scan sonar system for imaging                  the seafloor.  This system has 30 and 72 kHz side-scan                          transducers and a 3.5 kHz down-looking transducer.  This is a                   state-of-the-art system that has been under development since                   1986.  The use of side-scan and multibeam systems has increased                 in the academic community in the past few years and there is a                  need to understand and to quantify the images produced by these                 systems.                                                                             The PI proposes to collect a variety of sonar data sets                    during a 28-day cruise to the Monterey canyon area.  The                        objective of the program is to operate the new sonar system in                  a previously well-mapped and generally predictible geological                   environment to learn the types and extent of new information                    that can be obtained from this type of remote sensing.  This                    project will begin to replace the subjective methods presently                  used to describe and map seabem landforms and their sediment                    cover with quantitative techniques.                                                  Existing data in the area includes: DeepTow and Gloria II                  sonar imagery, seismic reflection data, sediment cores, total                   Seabeam bathymetric coverage, about 30,000 bottom photographs,                  and a number of submersible dives.  The area is also the site                   of current and long-term observations by NOAA, the USGS, the                    Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and others.  Thus,                    this area is a good location to compare and ground-truth the                    various bottom sensing systems.",
