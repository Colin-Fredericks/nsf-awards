 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in type systems is revealing that the theoretical nature of            types is surprisingly subtle and unexpectedly broad in scope.                   Software engineering payoffs for these theoretical results are close            at hand, and can impact a much wider range of language properties than          is commonly realized.  One such payoff is the exploitation of type              systems to interface program components - either programmer defined             modules, or units automatically derived by compilation.  Moreover,              type systems can provide a framework for multi-language interfaces, a           phenomenon we call open languages.  This concept will be explored by:                                                                                           1)  Development and formalization of a comprehensive type system for            SFLV, an advanced functional language, capturing essential static               properties of normal order evaluation (strictness), polymorphic                 typing, modes of logical  variable usage, and guarded function                  application under committed choice.                                                                                                                             2) Demonstration of the software engineering utility of this                    comprehensive type system for profiling and interfacing program                 modules in SFLV.                                                                                                                                                3) Evaluation of the multi-language capabilities of this approach in            two test cases:                                                                                                                                                     (1) interfacing Standard ML and Prolog in a sequential                      environment, and                                                                                                                                                    (2) combining SFLV and the imperative language Concurrent Scheme            in a parallel setting.                                                                                                                                          4) Assessment of the power and convenience of these two language                combinations by implementing a simplified type inference algorithm as           a representative monotonic constraint solving problem.",
