 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes of salt secretion play a fundamental role in the                  maintenance of body fluid volume and concentration in the                       majority of vertebrate species, as well as providing the basis                  for the secretory activity of a variety of different glandular                  structures - such as the pancreas, salivary glands and tear                     (lacrimal) glands.  Amongst the most powerful salt-secreting                    tissues known are the so-called \"salt glands\" found in certain                  non-mammalian vertebrates, which evolved specifically for the                   elimination of excess salt from the body fluids.  As such, these                tissues have recently become important model systems for the                    study of the basic processes of salt secretion.                                                                                                                 As a group, the reptiles are unique in the diversity of the salt                glands they possess, both in their anatomical origin (e.g.                      modified lacrimal glands, nasal glands, salivary glands) and in                 the nature of the secretions produced (some secrete only sodium,                others only potassium, and still others can switch between the                  two).  However, the cellular processes  involved in these diverse               secretory activities and their control are completely unknown.                  The aim of this project is to describe, at the cellular level,                  the relevant secretory mechanisms and their control.  This will                 not only increase the understanding of these fundamental, and                   physiologically important, processes but may also help us better                understand the basis of certain widespread clinical conditions                  (e.g. cystic fibrosis, cholera etc.) known to be associated with                the disruption of such salt-secreting activity in tissues.",
