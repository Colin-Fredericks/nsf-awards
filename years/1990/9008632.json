 "awd_abstract_narration": "One may define a \"time-constrained database\" as a database that                 has strict timing constraints in (a) responding to queries, (b)                 processing transactions, and in (c) database maintenance. A                     \"time-constrained query\" has the form of \"get the information x                 in no more than t time units\". This project deals with the                      problem of processing arbitrary time-constrained queries in                     centralized and single-user time-constrained databases. Various                 ways of revising a query into one which has the most                            \"informative\" response and can be evaluated within the given time               constraint with a controlled risk of overspending are                           investigated. Techniques for fragment selection and risk analysis               are introduced.  Semantic query processing techniques to control                the query processing times are investigated.                                                                                                                    The expected outcome of this research is (i) a methodology to                   process queries with time constraints, (ii) a prototype time-                   constrained database management system and a performance                        evaluation using the prototype, and (iii) heuristics about the                  use of various options under different data characteristics.                    Potential applications of the research results are in those areas               where time-critical database processing is important, e.g.,                     scientific applications and manufacturing environments.",
