 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of tuna swimming performance at the Kewalo Basin                        Research Facility, Honolulu, Hawaii are planned using a large                   water tunnel currently located at Scripps Institution of                        Oceanography.  Objectives of the study include verification                     that tunas can be induced to swim steadily in the instrument to                 justify future shipboard experiments with albacore in the                       California Current.  Use of the water tunnel at Kewalo, where                   tunas are kept routinely, will also permit more lengthy and                     elaborate experiments than are currently feasible or, for that                  matter have ever been carried out on tunas.  The metabolic cost                 of swimming for tunas and its relationship to body size,                        velocity, and temperature will be examined.  Also to be tested                  is the tuna's capacity for sustained swimming in the face of                    changes in ambient temperature and oxygen concentrations,                       environmental factors known to affect the movement pattern of                   Hawaiian tunas and most other species.  Experiments with the                    thermoregulatory capacity of these tropical tunas will provide                  the first-ever in vivo examination, in a swimming tuna, of                      heat-balancing responses to acute water temperature change, and                 permit testing of the conflicting ideas that heat balance is                    passive or physiologically regulated.  Water-tunnel studies                     will permit further examination of thermal effects on in vivo                   hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, another subject of recent                           controversy.",
