 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is great current interest in the infrared radiative                       properties of high-Tc superconducting films and crystals.                       This interest stems from both fundamental considerations and                    promising applications.  One promising application of high-Tc                   superconducting films is as infrared radiation detectors.  It                   has also been proposed to cool superconducting electronics for                  space applications passively by thermal radiation.  If the                      high-Tc superconductors are perfect reflectors at wavelengths                   greater than that corresponding to the energy gap, then a                       high-Tc superconductor radiation shield would show excellent                    performance if kept at a temperature of 20 K.  Precise                          knowledge of optical properties, and particularly the complex                   refractive indices of high-Tc superconducting films, are                        required to evaluate these applications.                                                                                                                        In this study the monochromatic normal reflectance of high-                     quality films of YBaCuO and BiSrCaCuO is being measured with                    sets of four identical samples for temperatures between 6 K                     and room temperature, at wavelengths from 0.5 um to 30 um.                      The measurements are performed with a high-precision grating                    spectrometer which was especially designed for the measurement                  of the low-temperature radiative properties of noble-metal                      films.  This apparatus does not employ a reference mirror.                      For the background measurement, the infrared beam travels                       through the sample compartment without optical interaction.                     The reflectance data are obtained by passing the beam through                   eight reflections from four identical samples.  This technique                  avoids both shortcomings associated with the reference-mirror                   single-reflection method.  Due to the absence of a mirror,                      absolute reflectance data are obtained, not values relative to                  a mirror reflectance less than unity.  The measurements are                     carried out with films of the highest quality available,                        fabricated by Siemens, Erlangen, West Germany, and the IBM                      T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights.  These films                     are of pseudocrystalline nature, with strong c axis upward                      orientation, such that the radiative properties of the ab                       plane of the crystal unit cell are measured.  These                             measurements are expected to set a new standard for the high-                   Tc materials.  This standard will help to clarify the                           applicability of BCS-based theories to the optical properties                   of superconducting high-Tc films.  The new precision                            measurements are also expected to shed light on the problem of                  the energy gap as observed by infrared spectra.",
