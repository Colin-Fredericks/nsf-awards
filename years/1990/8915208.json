 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists in a           joint seminar on \"Environment-Behavior Research,\" to be held in Kyoto,          Japan, July 19-20, 1990.  The central theme of the seminar is                   progress in cross-cultural collaboration in environment-behavior                research psychology.  Topics covered will be theory building,                   landscape perception, work and learning environments, housing and               family, public behavior, and safety and traffic.  This is the third             U.S.-Japan seminar on environmental psychology.  Since the first one            in 1980, Japanese-U.S. collaboration in this area has expanded and              diversified to create a body of interdisciplinary literature that               relates to both theoretical and applied areas of architecture,                  landscape architecture, sociology, anthropology, traffic safety,                industrial management, and the building industry.  Participants in              this seminar will benefit from sharing new results, evaluating the              progress of current projects, and promoting future cross-cultural               collaborative research.  The co-organizers of the seminar are                   Professor Robert B. Bechtel, Department of Psychology, University of            Arizona, and Dr. Yasumi Yoshitake, President, Kobe Design University,           Japan.                                                                                                                                                          The United States and Japan are leading industrial nations, and                 environmental issues and concerns are becoming of increasing importance         in both countries.  The topics for discussion at this seminar are of            mutual interest, and they lend themselves to cross-cultural investi-            gation.  There are enough differences in the experiences and                    perceptions in the two countries to make such cross-cultural studies            potentially useful to both sides.",
