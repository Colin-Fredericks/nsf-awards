 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncertain or incomplete data abounds in many database                           applications. For example, data received from a scientific                      instrument may contain measurement errors, market forecasts may                 identify several feasible scenarios, medical diagnostic test                    results may indicate several probable illnesses for the patient,                and so on. However, most existing database systems treat all data               as \"correct\", possibly leading to invalid conclusions. This                     project investigates management of uncertain data. In particular,               a new probabilistic data model is developed (as an extension to                 the relational model), where probabilities or confidences can be                associated with the values of attributes. These probabilities are               given in the form of a discrete probability distribution function               where the function may be incompletely specified. It is believed                that such model provides a natural formalism for describing the                 uncertain real world. Operators are developed for manipulating                  probabilistic data. They include operators that are analogous to                conventional relational operators, as well as new operators for                 dealing with probabilities (e.g., combining two distributions for               the same attribute). The model and the operators are validated                  using real world examples. A prototype database management system               that uses the probabilistic data model is designed to serve as a                basis for further research and to be implemented in future                      years.",
