 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determination of heat transfer coefficients for manufactured                    objects subjected to a flow field is an important engineering                   consideration for stress analysis and useful life prediction.                                                                                                   A new measurement technique to obtain pointwise heat transfer                   coefficients over complex geometric objects is proposed.  The                   method represents an alternative procedure to the traditional                   and time-consuming experimental technique which uses                            distributed heaters and temperature transducers implanted in a                  design prototype of a manufactured object to set and measure                    the thermal field at the surface of the object.  The new                        method has the potential to provide rapid determination of the                  heat transfer to, and temperature distribution on engineering                   devices, subjected to various flow regimes without the need                     for expensive and time-consuming instrumentation of the                         devices.  It is proposed as an integral step in a Computer                      Integrated Manufacturing scheme based on Computer-Aided-Design                  (CAD) of prototype engineering stems.                                                                                                                           The new method involves existing measurement tools and/or                       technology (CAD, multiple-event liquid crystals, a robotically                  controlled hot-air jet for the application of surface                           temperatures, and numerical thermal regime modeling), and                       these tools are applied iteratively to obtain the heat                          transfer coefficients.  In sequence:  1) a prototype                            engineering object is designed and manufactured via CAD;  2)                    the object is coated with liquid crystals so that optical                       measurements of surface temperature may be obtained;  3) the                    object is \"painted\" with a prescribed temperature distribution                  using the robotically-controlled hot jet;  4) the object is                     subjected to a flow field;  5) the new surface temperature                      distribution is determined optically;  6) a numerical model is                  used to calculate the surface temperatures using an estimated                   (best guess) distribution for the surface heat transfer                         coefficients;  7) if the numerical model predicts the same                      temperature distribution as that measured, then the estimated                   heat transfer distribution is correct.  If not, the sequence                    returns to step 3, and finally, after several iterations, the                   correct distribution of heat transfer coefficients over the                     object is obtained.",
