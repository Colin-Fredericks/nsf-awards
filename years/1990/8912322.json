 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the collaboration of a biophysicist, a                    synthetic organic chemist, a molecular geneticist and an X-ray                  crystallographer in a study of guanine nucleotide binding to so                 called G proteins using novel techniques of Raman vibrational                   spectroscopy that have recently been developed.  G proteins bind                either GDP or GTP, which act as allosteric effectors to control                 protein conformation and activity, and are involved in a large                  number of fundamental regulatory processes.  It is planned to                   characterize the molecular properties of the bound nucleotides,                 their interactions with surrounding protein residues at the                     active site and contrast this to their solution properties.                                                                                                     Within the past few years there has been considerable effort and                excitement on understanding a family of quanine nucleotide                      binding regulatory proteins, the so-called G proteins.  There are               several members of this family, and sub families, that are                      involved in a rather diverse set of biological functions.  A                    large number are involved as intermediaries in a variety of                     transmembrane processes.  In addition to their functional                       similarities, the G protein family also share common structural                 motifs;  their sequence homology and tertiary structure                         similarities are one of the strongest found in biology.",
