 "awd_abstract_narration": "an understanding of the nature, spatial variability and evolution               of the magmatic source region at subduction zones is one key                    toward an overall understanding of crust-mantle and lithosphere-                asthenosphere interactions.  Valuable insights into the magmatic                source beneath the Central American subduction zone have been                   determined through an evaluation of systematic trace element and                isotopic variations along the volcanic front (Feigenson and Carr,               1986; Walker, 1989; Walker and others, 1989; Carr and others                    1989).  These variations indicate that contributions to the                     magmatic source from the subducted Cocos plate decrease northward               from Central Nicaragua.  Preliminary geochemical data suggest                   that such \"slab\" contributions may also decrease across the arc.                This project is a trace element and sr, Nd and o isotopic study                 of behind-the-front (or BVF basaltic lavas from southeastern                    Guatemala, which should possess a minimal geochemical inheritance               from the subductd plate or slab.  As crustal differentiation                    processes are also minimized behind the front, the geochemistry                 of BVF lavas will provide the clearest picture of perhaps the                   most vital element of the magmatic source, the mantle wedge.                    Comparison of trace element and isotopic data for Guatemalan                    volcanic front (or VF) and BVF basaltic lavas will permit an                    evaluation of source involvement in across-arc geochemical                      variations particularly and degree of involvement of the                        subcontinental lithosphere.  Study of trace element and isotopic                data on both V or BVF Basalts will therefore provide a                          comprehensive understanding of the nature and variations in the                 magmatic source for a single subduction zone.",
