 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support U.S. participation in the Third Internation-            al Meeting on P4 and P2-related Phages to take place in Gargnano,               Italy on May 17-19, 1990. The meeting is being jointly organized                by Professor Richard Calendar of the University of California-                  Berkeley and Professor Gianni Deho of the Universita degli Studi                di Milano.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together                     scientists from the major laboratories invoved in P2/P4 phage work,             in order to share experimental results of the last three years                  and to plan future research and collaborations.                                                                                                                 Due to the small number of laboratories working in this field,                  many of them European, collaborative efforts have proven extremely              valuable in the past and arise naturally out of the close                       interaction provided by these meetings.  Previous meetings have                 significantly furthered productive interactions in the P2/P4                    community.  This meeting also will provide an opportunity to plan               future research efforts so that progress will continue in a wide                variety of areas and, at the same time, prevent duplication of                  effort.",
