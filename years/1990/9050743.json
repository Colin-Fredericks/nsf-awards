 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the use of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) to                 acquire and analyze high-quality digital spectra and images                     obtained with existing spectrographs and telescopes.  Student                   project work using these upgraded instruments are done in both the              optics laboratory and the observatory.                                                                                                                          Two scientific-grade CCD detector systems, the Star I/Series 300                system, from Photometrics Ltd. of Tucson, Arizona are used.  These              systems have been added to existing moderate-and high-resolution                spectrographs and to a 56-cm telescope.                                                                                                                         This upgrade in detector capability provides students with the                  experience of (1) working with state-of-the-art instruments of the              type now commonly found in many optics laboratories and                         observatories, and (2) carrying out quantitative analysis of the                data obtained with these instruments using sophisticated image                  processing software.                                                                                                                                            The outcome of this program is a greatly enhanced lab experience                for students in physics and astronomy.  The college is matching the             award in with an equal amount of funds.",
