 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, a marked depletion of stratospheric ozone has                  caused an increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the                   surface of the Earth.  With this increase, concern and interest                 has been raised as to what specific effects UV radiation has on                 cellular processes in organisms.  One such effect, the damage of                DNA, has been extensively investigated in bacterial and mammalian               systems; however, limited information exists on the effects of UV               damage to plant DNA and its in vivo repair by cellular                          mechanisms.  This proposal describes the initial study of a ring-               saturated pyrimidine incising activity found in plant cells                     against UV irradiated or oxidized DNA.  This enzymatic activity                 will be purified from Brassica oleracea (cauliflower) by                        conventional techniques including ion-exchange, affinity, and gel               filtration chromatography.  The substrate specificity against UV-               irradiated or oxidized, radiolabeled polydeoxyribonucleotides                   will be characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography                    (HPLC).  Using the purified enzyme as a probe, the effects of DNA               base sequence on the formation of these lesions and their                       subsequent in vivo repair will be quantified.  Since the                        chloroplast genome is also susceptible to damage, the presence of               the ring-saturated pyrimidine-DNA repair enzyme in chloroplasts                 will be investigated.  This should determine if there is a means                to effectively remove this damaged lesion from chloroplast DNA to               maintain the integrity of this genetic material.  The results of                these studies should lead to a better understanding of the                      biochemical processes that constitute the plant cellular                        response to DNA damage.  The aim is to ultimately use the                       knowledge obtained from this project to isolate plant strains                   that have an increased ability to repair damage caused by                       radiation and oxidation and therefore have an increased survival                capacity.",
