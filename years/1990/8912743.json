 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur                 around the globe.  Understanding of this phenomenon is a                        challenging problem because it is necessary to understand both                  complex dynamic and microphysical processes at scales of motion                 that are smaller than typically measured by conventional weather                networks.  This scale of motion is termed storm-scale or                        mesoscale by meteorologists.                                                        The National Science Council of Taiwan established a Multiple               Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological component                       focussed on improving flash flood predictions.  A major field                   project, entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment (TAMEX),                 was held in the Spring of 1987.  The project was a joint effort                 of various Taiwanese agencies with participation from the                       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National                Science Foundation (NSF).  The scientific goals were to study the               mesoscale systems that form on a quasi-stationary and consistent                feature known as the Mei-Yu front and cause the heavy rains known               as the \"plum rains\".                                                                Under a previous award from NSF the Principal Investigator                  participated in the field phase of the TAMEX and began analysis                 of the data.  Preliminary results indicate that the mechanisms                  important for the formation, intensification and maintenance of                 the Mei-Yu front may be somewhat different than previously                      thought.  Using aircraft, radar, surface and upper air data, the                Principal Investigator will continue his diagnostic studies of                  the structure of the frontal systems and the severe rain events                 that they spawn. //",
