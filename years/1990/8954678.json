 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the work is to create models of children's construction          of the rational numbers of arithmetic that are useful in scientific and         educational endeavors.  In the context of working with children in logo         microworlds in a constructivist teaching experiment, the psychological          goal of the investigators is to create a model of children:                     construction of the operations that generate the rational numbers of            arithmetic, along with a scientific language that specifies the                 mathematics of children in this contentual domain.  The educational goal        is to elaborate components of possible learning environments for                children based on computer microworlds and to include (1) a                     specification of possible learning periods along with the goals and             intentions within these periods, (2) the mathematical concepts and              operations of the involved students within the learning period and              itineraries of construction, (3) problem situations that served in the          establishment and modification of learning environments by the involved         students within the learning periods, (4) critical decisions we made in         posing the problems to the students, and (5) examples of operating that         carried them to new and more powerful concepts.  To facilitate this             work, the principal investigators will establish a working group on the         rational numbers of arithmetic and will conduct a scientific and an             educational workshop.",
