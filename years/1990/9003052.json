 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to complete                          characterization of the hemolytic agent(s) from the human blood                 parasite Schistosoma mansoni.  First it is planned to determine the             chemical identity of the lytic agent(s) as well as its metabolic                precursors using HPLC techniques and radioactive precursors.  Previous          studies suggest that the lytic agent can influence the organization             and dynamics of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, therefore, it is             proposed to use fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques to              determine changes which occur in the RBC membrane during the lytic              process.  Finally, the localization of the lytic activity within live           schistosomes will be determined.  Through this study it is hoped to             increase our knowledge on factors influencing red cell membrane                 dynamics as well our knowledge on direct interactions between a human           parasite and the cells of its host.                                               The interactive component will involve lecturing in the regular               parasitology course offered to Harvard graduate students, presenting a          seminar series for graduate and undergraduate students on \"Careers for          Women in Science,\" and participating in the Women in Academic Medicine          Network.\"  In addition, Dr. Kasschau will discuss careers in Biology            and medicine with interested high school students.                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
