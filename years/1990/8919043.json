 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for continuation of support at the American               Geophysical Union for the independent secretariat that has been                 established there to serve the Council of Mangers of National Antarctic         Program (MNAP) and its Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and            Operations (SCALOP).  The MNAP concept, to provide for more effective           communication and interaction among the national managers, has proven           initially successful and has been recognized at the international               diplomatic level, by the international scientific community, and also           by the more than twenty national governments involved.                          The establishment of the MNAP secretariat at the American Geophysical           Union has proven efficient and beneficial.  In general, there has been          a positive reaction to the association of the MNAP Council and its              secretariat with the AGU and its objectives that embrace Antarctic              research and the promotion of international cooperation.  At the AGU            the employment of the MNAP Executive Secretary and the provision of             office facilities, clerical support and related services and equipment          will continue.  The AGU is well situated to provide the essential               telecommunications along with computer, printing and publication, and           associated services.  Project plans also call for the AGU to process            financial contributions from the various national managers and to               assist as required with meeting arrangements.",
