 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an extension of Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) to         Grades 1-3, to the content domains identified in the NCTM Standards for         those grades, to multicultural populations, and to preservice education         programs.  Outcomes include a pre- and inservice teacher education              program.  Research outcomes include knowledge about how teachers use            knowledge about children's thinking; how classrooms are structured when         teachers have CGI knowledge; and how teachers' beliefs and knowledge            influence their instruction and their children's learning.  Knowledge           will be gathered about the impact of CGI on preservice teachers'                knowledge of children's thinking and its use during their first year            teaching.                                                                                                                                                       At the University of Wisconsin (Site I), a longitudinal study of grades         1-3 will be implemented and the preservice work will be initiated.  At          the University of Maryland (Site II), CGI will be implemented and               studied in multicultural schools.  At both sites during the first year,         teachers and children will be identified; baseline data about their             knowledge and beliefs will be gathered; materials will be developed to          give teachers access to knowledge about children's thinking; and work           with teachers will begin.  At Site I during the next three years, a             longitudianl study will investigate the development of teachers'                knowledge and beliefs, its impact on instruction and on learning.  At           Site II, CGI (as defined by addition/subtraction) will be taught to a           group of teachers during Year I and its impact on the teachers and their        children will be assessed during Year II.  At Site I, participating             preservice institutions will be identified during Year I.  During Year          2, educators will receive CGI knowledge and they will implement it in           their preservice programs during Years 3 & 4 and teachers who graduated         from these programs will be studied.  During the last year, the research        will be reported and the revision of the workshop materials will be             completed.                                                                                                                                                      This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Development,        Research and Informal Science Education and the Division of Teacher             Preparation and Enhancement.",
