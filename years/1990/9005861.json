 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relatively little is known about how disturbance regimes                   vary along major environmental gradients and how that variation                 contributes to coarse-scale vegetation patterns.  The proposed                  research will focus on variation i disturbance regimes along a                  west-to-east trans-Andean transect from Andean montane                          rainforests to the ecotone with the Patagonian steppe at c. 40 S                latitude.  The major disturbance are fie windthrow mass                         movements, logging, and the effects of introduced browsing                      animals.  The research is multi-scale in approach and includes                  the qualification of vegetation and disturbance patterns at a                   landscape scale as well as the analysis of mechanisms responsible               for those patterns at stand scales.  The will map vegetation and                disturbances from a series of aerial photographs of different                   ages, date disturbance events with tree-ring techniques, and                    quantitatively analyze tree population structure to examine                     responses to disturbances.  The expected results will be                        significant contributions to both the theory of landscape ecology               and to the methodology for quantification of the spatial and                    temporal characteristics of disturbances along an extensive                     environmental gradient.  It will also provide an understanding                  of how spatial heterogeneity in the vegetation results from both                the variation in the physical environment and variation in                      disturbance regimes as modified by human activities.   //",
