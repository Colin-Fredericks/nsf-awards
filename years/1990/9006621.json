 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the role of resource islands in the                desertification of the Jornada basin of southern New Mexico.                    Resource islands represent small-scale patches or \"hot spots\" of                biological activity distributed across a heterogeneous desert                   landscape.  They can be characterized by the functional and                     structural properties of the shrubs that occupy and form the                    island, along with the interactions of the shrubs with their                    immediate abiotic and biotic environment.  The significance of                  these islands to the function and persistence of desert                         ecosystems in response to disturbances and environmental change                 is poorly understood.                                                                This project, conducted by Drs. Virginia and Reynolds, seeks               to understand how desert shrubs acquire resources to form these                 islands.  The investigators are also interested in understanding                how the degree of island formation is related to the stability of               individual islands, and the role of resource island formation in                determining the stability of desert grasslands and shrublands.                  These tasks will be accomplished by an integrated field and                     modeling research effort that will: 1) examine the degree of                    resource island formation associated with the two most successful               shrubs (Prosopis glandulosa \u0131mesquite!, Larrea tridentata                       \u0131creosotebush!) in the recently desertified Jornada landscape; 2)               determine if structural changes accompanying island formation                   (e.g. plant architecture) result in a positive feedback system of               island self-augmentation; 3) determine if the magnitude and                     pattern of response of Larrea and Prosopis to an extreme                        environmental change (e.g. induced summer drought) is a function                of the degree of island formation; and 4) develop landscape                     models that can increase our understanding of the stability of                  grassland-shrubland systems in a changing environment.                               Drs. Virginia and Reynolds are leading ecosystem ecologists                and have outstanding institutional support for this research.",
