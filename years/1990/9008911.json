 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop in three                          areas of condensed matter physics: surfaces, thin films                         and small particles.  The U.S. organizers are Adolfo                            Eguiluz of Montana State University and Fernando Ponce                          of Xerox Corporation, along with five others from                               countries other than the U.S.:  Mexico, Germany,                                Colombia and Brazil.  The Peruvian organizers are from                          Lima and Cusco: M. Horn, V. Latorre, E. Lopez-Carranza                          and E. Gil.  In addition, there is an International                             Advisory Committee with members from countries throughout                       Central and South America as well as from the U.S.,                             Spain, France and Italy.  Forty contributions have been                         invited out of a total submission of 150 abstracts                              indicating wide interest and participation on the part                          of Latin American physicists and others from the U.S.                           and Europe.  Some of the papers are the result of                               ongoing U.S.-Latin American collaborations.  The                                proceedings will be published by an international                               publisher as have those of previous such symposia.                                                                                                              The workshop will consist of oral presentations in                              addition to poster sessions.  The topics include atomic                         and electronic structure of metallic and semiconductor                          surfaces, interaction with radiation, physics, and                              chemisorption, quantum effects, magnetism and applications                      to catalysis and corrosion.  In keeping with the goal of                        fostering mutilateral collaborations, a round-table                             session will be held to highlight the main themes of the                        workshop, make recommendations of future research                               directions and to organize preliminary arrangements of                          collaborative projects that have developed during the                           workshop.",
