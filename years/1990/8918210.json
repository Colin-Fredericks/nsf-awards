 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the study of alkyl                 nitrates and other organic nitrate species in the troposphere.                  Alkyl nitrates are products of hydroxyl radical initiated                       hydrocarbon oxidation in the presence of the oxides of                          nitrogen.  Other organic nitrates are formed from alkenes,                      carbonyls, and biogenic hydrocarbons when they are oxidized in                  the presence of nitrogen oxides.  Because of their potential                    contribution to the reactive nitrogen budget, and because of                    their significance to tropospheric ozone chemistry, detailed                    information is required to understand the sources, composition,                 concentration, and transport of organic nitrates in the global                  troposphere.                                                                         This research program includes laboratory and field                        investigations of selected organic nitrates compounds.                          Laboratory studies will improve analytical methodology and                      examine reactions of hydrocarbons in test systems.  The field                   program is designed to accurately measure a suite of organic                    nitrates at remote sites subject to episodic inputs of air                      masses containing primary and secondary organic emissions.  The                 sites include a station in the Arctic, in the North Atlantic,                   and in the continental US.  Since these sites have active                       atmospheric chemistry studies already underway, the                             measurements can be related to a broad scope of atmospheric                     chemical processes.  Measurements of the concentration and                      composition of nitrates (and other species) will be compared to                 existing models of organic nitrate formation, sources, and                      transport.  These studies should help to refine understanding                   of nitrogen/carbon transformations and fate of reactive                         nitrogen in the global atmosphere.",
