 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space science has long sought the answer to the cause for                  different types of auroral structures and their occurrence at                   different times within the global magnetic activity.  The                       research scientists in this program have in the past attempted to               trace the effects of currents from the ionosphere near quiet time               auroral structures into the magnetosphere using quiet time                      magnetic field models.  This new project will use a more                        disturbed model of the magnetosphere to investigate more dynamic                structures associated with the auroral substorm, such as auroral                loops, poleward surges and  omega bands. In addition, this new                  model  will allow study of mapping effects produced by the                      diversion of cross-tail current to the ionosphere.  These studies               of the coupling between electron and ion currents in the inner                  magnetotail  may help to unravel some of the physical processes                 that take place during the auroral substorm onset.",
