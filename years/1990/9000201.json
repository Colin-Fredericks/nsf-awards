 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three classes of symbiont-bearing sarcodines                           (acantharia, polycystine radiolaria and foraminifera) are a                     conspicuous component of upper ocean communities.  Most of the                  previous research on the ecology of these taxa has been                         concentrated on a single species or limited group of species. Dr.               Caron and colleagues will simultaneously examine the ecological                 role of the entire assemblage of these three protozoa. Their                    research examines two hypotheses:  1.  In nutrient-poor oceanic                 environments, the symbiont primary production in the entire                     population of acantharia, polycystine radiolaria and foraminifera               will represent a significant fraction of the total primary                      production and will dominate the production by large cells                      (operationally defined as cells larger than 74um).  2. Sarcodines               will be a disproportionately important component of sinking                     material from the euphotic zone compared with their suspended                   biomass. Symbiont production rates of the entire population of                  symbiont-bearing sarcodines are determined through a combination                of  large volume and diver-collected production measurements to                 evaluate the importance of this production relative to total                    primary production.  The significance of these planktonic                       protists for the vertical flux of material is estimated by the                  concurrent measurement of both the stocks of sarcodines and the                 rate of sinking export. These measurements are coordinated with                 the GOFS Time-Series Study at Bermuda (participation in two                     cruises per year), which enables the investigators to view their                results from a large, seasonal perspective.",
