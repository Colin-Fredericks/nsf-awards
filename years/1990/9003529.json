It was observed that the specific                                               geotechnical conditions at a site and the                                       thickness of the soft soil deposits had a                                       significant influence on the distribution of                                    damage and apparent intensity of shaking                                        during the earthquake.  Immediately following                                   the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey                                      (USGS) undertook the installation, in the                                       most severely damaged areas of San Francisco                                    and Oakland, of strong motion instruments on                                    the ground surface and in deep boreholes on                                     top of bedrock.  Undisturbed soil samples                                       were recovered from all the significant                                         geologic units within the soil profile during                                   the drilling operations.  These samples                                         contain information that can be used to                                         perform full dynamic site response analyses                                     for both post-mortem investigations of the                                      site response, and for prediction of the                                        future response to strong ground shaking.                                                                                                                       The objective of this study is to obtain this                                   information through appropriate                                                 classification tests and dynamic response                                       tests performed on these soil samples, and to                                   combine this information with in-situ shear                                     wave velocity measurements obtained by the                                      USGS: this will result in a full description                                    of the dynamic response characteristics of                                      the soil deposit.                                                                                                                                               The results are to be presented as a report                                     containing the complete stress-strain data as                                   well as the derived modulus and damping ratio                                   as a function of strain.",
