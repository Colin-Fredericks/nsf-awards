 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Goldberg is continuing his research toward a biography of                   General Leslie R. Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan                   Engineer District.  No scholarly biography of Groves has yet                    been written.  All previous treatments of Groves show him                       \"full blown\" and unexplained in September 1942 in the office                    of OSRD Director Vannevar Bush.  Dr. Goldberg's study is                        providing a context for understanding who Leslie R. Groves                      was, why he was picked to head the atom bomb project and why                    he was so effective. In addition, this biographical study                       provides a vehicle for analyzing anew the changing                              relationship between the military and civilian sectors of the                   American scientific and technological research communities                      during and immediately after World War II.",
