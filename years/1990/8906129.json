 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary biology involves two major processes: the                     origin of genetic variants in a population, and the genetic                     differentiation of populations and species.  Understanding both                 of these processes is critical to managing the earth's natural                  resources for sustained agriculture, as well as for answering                   basic questions concerning life itself.  Since these two                        processes apply to all genetic traits- including the three plant                genomes (nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast)- this framework                serves to focus the research proposed here.  In particular, this                research concerns the origin of genetic diversity in the                        chloroplast genome of higher plants.                                                 Previous studies of chloroplast DNA evolution have often                   compared distantly rated groups of plants and observed structural               rearrangement of the genome.  From these data, mechanisms have                  been inferred to explain the origin of novel genotypes; however,                no direct studies of those mechanisms have been attempted.  As a                result, much about the origin of genetic diversity in the                       chloroplast genome of higher plants is unknown.                                      The proposed research aims to study two possible mechanisms                involved in the origin of new chloroplast genotypes.  Using a                   unique set of dispersed repeated elements located in the                        chloroplast genome of some clovers, plants in the genus                         Trifolium, Dr. Milligan will examine both mechanisms.  By                       studying the genomic structure in several closely related species               with differing numbers of repeats, he will be able to identify                  whether or not rearrangements are associated with the repeats.                  By sequencing different copies of the repeats he will be able to                detect whether nonreciprocal recombination has occurred.                             This more direct study of the origin of genetic diversity in               the chloroplast genome of higher plants will greatly increase our               understanding of the mechanisms involved.  not only will this                   provide information important to our basic understanding of                     evolution, but it may also provide a basis for modifying the                    genome in the future.  since the plant chloroplast is responsible               for photosynthesis, modifications of the genome may prove to be                 an important tool in the future agricultural efforts.",
