 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research described in this proposal explores new                                approaches to increasing the yields of charcoal from                            biomass.  Thermogravimetric studies of water washed, acid                       washed (low temperature), and acid hydrolyzed bagasse will                      be undertaken to determine the influence of the various                         components of bagasse on charcoal formation.  Considerable                      experimental evidence has accumulated which suggests that                       elevated pressures and a stagnant gas environment can                           double the usual yield of charcoal from biomass.                                This phenomena will be detailed by studying biomass                             pyrolysis in closed, sealed crucibles using a differential                      scanning calorimeter to monitor heat demand.  Both studies                      of peak pressure and substrate composition will be                              undertaken to gain insight into how charcoal yields from                        biomass can be improved.  Kinetic analysis of the data                          will also be completed.  These studies rely on                                  complementary expertise and instrumentation available in                        the Renewable Resources Research Laboratory of the                              University of Hawaii, and the Hungarian Academy of                              Sciences Laboratory for Inorganic Chemistry.  The research                      will be accomplished during exchange visits of scientists                       between the two laboratories.  Results of this work will                        be particularly important to Pacific rim countries                              (Thailand, the Philippines, India, and China) which use                         substantial amounts of charcoal for cooking, and other                          developing countries (such as Brazil) which rely on                             charcoal to smelt iron ore.",
