 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in developmental biology concerns the                     mechanisms by which cells interact in a harmonious fashion such                 that their spatial and temporal organization results in a                       functional metazoan.  One such mechanism involves the use of                    diffusible substances, released by one cell (or tissue) which                   affect the behavior of a specific target cell (or tissue).  A                   well documented, but poorly understood example is that of                       chemotactic signalling, a seemingly ubiquitous phenomenon in                    embryogenesis and development.  The long term objective of this                 research is to understand the biogenesis of a chemotactic                       signalling system.  The model system is D. discoideum, for which                pulses of cAMP function as the chemotactic signal.  Production of               the chemotactic signal, once initiated, is autocatalytic.  The                  primary focus of this research is the role of the cAMP cell                     surface receptor in regulating the production of cAMP pulses.                   Current lines of investigation consist of biochemical analysis of               receptor phosphorylation, and the characterization of CAR-kinase,               the enzyme which specifically phosphorylates the ligand-occupied                form of the cAMP receptor in plasma membranes.                                                                                                                  The results of this research will provide new information                       concerning a novel enzyme (kinase) that phosphorylates the                      cell membrane receptor for the chemoattractant molecule, cyclic                 AMP, and about the role of receptor phosphorylation in signal                   transduction.  Of particular interest is how such phenomena are                 regulated to produce sustained oscillations of cAMP such that                   pulses of cAMP are produced.",
