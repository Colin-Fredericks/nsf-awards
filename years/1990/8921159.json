 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-standing problem for wide-band-gap                                       semiconductors (band gap greater than about 2 eV)                               is that of obtaining good bipolar conductivity, with                            resultant problems of obtaining good (efficient) p-n-                           cunctions.  This problem has been particularly severe                           in the II-VI materials, which otherwise have a umber                            of desirable properties.  Recent work has shown that                            the basic difficulty resides in a poor solubility of                            shallow dopants.  Consequently, non-equilibrium                                 impurity incorporation is generally required.  We                               propose to work with laser processing, in view of its                           very rapid thermal quenching and its photolytic                                 doping capabilities.  It will be checked whether such                           processing can give adequate conductivity with use of                           just a single (primary) dopant, or whether a newly                              suggested procedure , joint incorporation of both such                          a primary dopant and a (mobile) compensating                                    species, with subsequent removal of the latter, will be                         required .  We plan to focus on ZnSe, but with some                             work probably also on CdS, and obtain well -                                    conducting p-type, reproducible. This has not been                              previously achieved.  Good p-type would lead to good                            p-n junctions, since good n-type is available, and                              resultant devices, such as light emitting diodes and                            diode lasers in the green and higher spectral ranges,                           and better solar cells.",
