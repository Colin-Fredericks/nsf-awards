The impetus                       comes from the researchers in the area who, because of the                      interdisciplinary nature of the many applications of particle                   technology, are active in a broad range of formal technical                     organizations and societies.  The Congress and Workshop will                    bring together researchers from industry, government, and                       academia to discuss the present state and future needs for                      radiation sources and electro-optical components used in                        characterizing particles and dispensed media.                                                                                                                   Particulate and multi-phase flow processes control the                          ultimate performance of a large number of important systems                     involved in metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, atomization and                        sprays, cloud physics, and thermal or plasma spraying/coating.                  Advances in both research and industrial process facets of                      these applications will require improved diagnostics for the                    multi-phase system, with characterization of the dispersed                      phase being a dominant part.  Optical methods for multi-phase                   flow diagnostics, by virtue of being noncontact, nonintrusive,                  and potentially real-time, will be required in next-generation                  sensors for intelligent process control.",
