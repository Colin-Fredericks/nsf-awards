 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will allow for a further understanding                    of cell transformation.  Studies to data have used whole                        Agrobacterium cells to identify several (vir) protein                           products essential for the production of a transferable DNA                     copy, the T-strand.  The proposed experiments will use                          predominantly biochemical approaches to analyze T-strand                        synthesis and processing into a T-strand-protein complex (T-                    complex) using purified components in vitro.  Specifically,                     these studies will (1) reconstruct T-strand synthesis in                        vitro using a DNA substrate and purified vir proteins.  If                      necessary, commercially available enzymes (DNA polymerases,                     topoisomerases) or whole cell extracts from Agrobacterium                       will be used to supplement the reaction.  (2) Assays will be                    carried out to determine whether the T-complex characterized                    to date (and assembled in vitro) consisting of T-strands and                    VirE2 and VirD2 is capable of transforming plant protoplasts.                   As other proteins of the T-complex are identified they will                     be added to the T-strand-VirD2-VirE2 complex to test their                      role in enhancing plant cell transformation.  (3) Additional                    proteins that potentiate T-complex transfer will be defined                     by their affinity to columns carrying covalently bound VirD2                    or VirE2 and by a recently developed assay for proteins that                    mediate export of T-strands from whole Agrobacterium cells.                     (4) The functional domains of proteins required for T-strand                    synthesis and processing will be defined by assaying for                        activity subfragments of these proteins produced by deletion                    mutants or proteolytic digestion.  (5) By using a sensitive                     in vitro assay for integration of exogenous DNA it will be                      determined if the T-complex has an integrase function.  The                     proposed experiments are relevant to the biology of the                         Agrobacterium-plant cell interaction and to DNA transfer                        technology.                                                                                                                                                     In nature, Agrobacterium transfers a specific DNA segment,                      the T-DNA, into a plant nucleus where, following stable                         integration, the genetic material is expressed in the plant                     cell.  This property of Agrobacterium has prompted an intense                   investigation of the requirements for transfer and has led to                   the design of vectors capable of transferring any DNA of                        interest to plant cells without interfering with normal plant                   growth and differentiation.  While Agrobacterium can now be                     used routinely as a vector to transfer DNA to many plant                        cells without the need to understand the underlying                             mechanisms involved, it is important to understand the                          biology of the system so that advances in the use of the                        vector properties of the system can be made.  This research                     will investigate the detailed steps involved during the DNA                     transfer process so that improved methods to allow directed                     DNA transfer to plant cells can be achieved.",
