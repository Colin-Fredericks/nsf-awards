 "awd_abstract_narration": "The report that Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary sediments               are greatly enriched in iridium (Ir) has generated an intense                   controversy concerning the origin of this signal.  Although                     convincing evidence suggests that the Ir anomaly was generated by               the collision of a large bolide with the Earth, other                           explanations claim that extensive, violent volcanism can account                for the Ir spike.  We have recently found that K/T boundary                     sediments at Stevns Klint, Denmark contain two amino acids which                are exceedingly rare on the Earth, but which are some of the most               abundant amino acids in carbonaceous meteorites.  An                            extraterrestrial source is the most reasonable explanation for                  the presence of these amino acids.                                                   Many questions have been raised by our preliminary study.                  Are these extraterrestrial amino acids present in other K/T                     boundary sediments?  How do we explain the large amounts of                     extraterrestrial amino acids in the K/T boundary sediments?  Why                is the extraterrestrial amino acid signal absent in the Stevns                  Klint boundary clay, but present directly above and below?  In                  order to answer these questions we will examine other K/T                       boundary sequences for amino acids; stable isotope analyses will                be performed on the isolated amino acid fractions to further                    demonstrate their extraterrestrial origin; sediments of different               ages and depositional environments will be analyzed to determine                whether there is a measurable terrestrial production of these                   amino acids; we will investigate whether other extraterrestrial                 amino acids are present in K/T boundary sediments; and                          experiments will be conducted to evaluate the survivability of                  extraterrestrial amino acids both during impact and after                       deposition.  These analyses will enable us to ascertain the                     global distribution of the extraterrestrial amino acid signal,                  what processes may have subsequently disturbed these amino acids,               and what kind of object or processes supplied this unique organic               cosmochemical signal.",
