The chamber, which is to be                                       attached to an existing molecular beam epitaxy                                  system, will be used by the principal                                           investigator and his colleagues in the                                          Department of Electrical Engineering and                                        Computer Science research on high performance                                   electronic, opto-electronic, photonic, and                                      quantum devices and integrated systems.  In                                     addition to being designed for etching and                                      cleaning inside the UHV environment, this                                       system is designed to enable researchers to                                     mask, etch, pattern, and/or otherwise process                                   III-V heterostructures outside the growth                                       system; to return them to the UHV growth                                        environment; and to then clean, etch, and                                       prepare their surfaces for further MBE growth.                                  It furthermore includes provision to coat the                                   prepared surfaces with arsenic to protect them                                  from contamination during subsequent transfer                                   and storage within the multi-chamber growth                                     system, as well as during removal from the                                      system.",
