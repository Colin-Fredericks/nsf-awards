 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hypothesis that proteins in aqueous solution interact                       with adsorbent surfaces primarily via hydrophobic                               interactions will be tested by manipulation of the                              hydrophobic effect at its origin: the ability of the                            solvent to assume ordered structures in the vicinity of                         nonpolar species.  This method is a desirable alternative                       to studies of protein adsorption to a wide variety of                           materials, where aspects of the surface chemistry other                         than hydrophobicity are varied in an uncontrolled manner.                       As cosolvents with water, methanol impairs the                                  hydrophobic effect, glycerol enhances it, and ethylene                          glycol does not significantly alter the effect.  By                             careful selection of the experimental system, constant                          protein conformation and adsorbent surface chemistry will                       be maintained in the presence of the different structure-                       altering cosolvents in order to assess the role of the                          hydrophobic effect in controlling adsorption isotherms and                      rates, adsorption reversibility, and surface diffusion.                         While adsorption isotherms and rates of adsorption and                          desorption reflect long time processes, measurements of                         surface diffusion coefficients provide information about                        processes occurring in the protein-surface binding region                       on rapid time scales.",
