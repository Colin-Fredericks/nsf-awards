 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the patterns and timing of latest                Pleistocene deglaciation and particularly of Holocene climatic                  change as recorded in fluctuations of glaciers on the Kenai                     Peninsula, southwest Alaska.  Work will focus in the landfast                   glaciers, which here lack evidence of irregular flow and which                  may be expected to have experienced cycles of advance and retreat               similar to those that are widely recorded in Alaska, but with                   variations reflecting individual aspect, position and hypsometry.               Calving outlet glaciers in the Kenai Fjords National Park, by                   contrast, have displayed prolonged advanced followed by dramatic                retreat in cycles dominated by such factors as fjords depth and                 configuration, water circulation, and ice-marginal sediment                     accumulation.  Evaluation of moraine modification as well as the                methods of radiocarbon dating, tephrochronology, lichenomentry                  and dendrochronology, will be critically applied in building the                glacial chronology.  Because most of the ice tongues end in                     forested areas, tree-ring dating of surfaces and selective                      cross-dating of living trees with buried wood may be a                          particularly powerful dating tool.",
