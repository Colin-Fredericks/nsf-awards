 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal focuses on the emergence of Post-secondary               educational institutions on rural Alaska during the period                      1970-1988.  The Ph.D candidate is an Alaskan Native and his study               focuses on the role played by Native Alaskan legislators in the                 creation of these institutions.  Key questions are \"Why were these              institutions established, and what determined localization to                   Bethel, Kotzebue and Nome?  Further, was the primary purpose to                 serve the educational needs of the Native population or to provide              an infrastructure for economic development?  Native leaders,                    including lobbyists and bureaucrats will be interviewed in order                to elucidate the Alaskan political process, and the way the process             is perceived by the Native \"actors\".  This is compared with the                 dominant culture's \"Rules of the Game\" politics.  Documentary                   sources from the Alaska state legislature, the Alaska Federation                of Natives, the Alaska Native Foundation, The University of the                 Alaska, and regional corporations provide the official record of                events.                                                                                                                                                         The methodology of the study incorporates anthropological interview             techniques and draws upon political science \"Rules of the Game\"                 theory.  The educational historical analysis will focus on policy               matters.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed grant is intended to cover travel to numerous Native               communities, consultant fees and transcription costs.  The                      preliminary dissertation title is \"Post Secondary Education                     Institutions in Rural Alaska, 1970-1988: resistance,                            accommodations, abundonment.\" The thesis is expected to be                      completed in late spring 1991.",
