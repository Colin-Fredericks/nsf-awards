 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertebrates have diverse reproductive cycles spanning continua from             brief to prolonged breeding seasons, and from precisely timed to                opportunistic reproductive periods.  Variations in the timing of                gonadal maturation and onset of breeding require that individuals of a          population or species adjust secretion of reproductive hormones in              response to environmental signals.  Dr. Wingfield proposes to develop           a mathematical model to describe the type of breeding cycle for a given         population.  Of particular interest are the degrees of constancy and            contingency within a particular breeding cycle.  The more constancy             within a cycle (e.g. the environment is in a state conducive to                 breeding most of the time), then less environmental information is              required to regulate secretion of reproductive hormones and thus                optimize breeding.  As contingency in the cycle increases (e.g. the             environment shows major changes in suitability for breeding within a            year), more environmental cues are required to time onset of breeding.          The PI has chosen several avian species, with varying degrees of                constancy and contingency in their reproductive cycles, as tests of             this model.  The responses of each species to environmental signals             known to influence reproductive function (e.g. annual change in                 daylength, temperature, availability of food) will be tested.  Their            effects on gonadal development, and secretion of reproductive hormones          will be measured.  Ultimately, the effects of these environmental cues          on gene expression for hormones within the brain, that act as a link            between the environmental and internal processes, will also be                  determined.                                                                                                                                                     The proposed research is designed to explore the possibility of a               unifying theory that can be used to predict how all vertebrates (and            perhaps all organisms) integrate signals from the environment in order          to optimize reproduction.  It may also be possible to use this model            for processes other than reproduction (e.g. migration, growth etc.)             The research will provide new insight into the mechanisms by which              environmental signals are transduced into internal processes (such as           hormone secretion) that regulate reproductive function.  This may have          considerable impact on our knowledge of reproduction in general, and            could provide a firm base for approaching problems of how to breed and          protect endangered species and populations.",
