 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to tell which portion of the                     metal ion coordination sphere faces the enzyme, and which faces                 the solvent when MgATP or MgADP combine with an enzyme such as                  hexokinase.  To permit such micromapping the investigators will                 prepare and characterize inert chromium complexes of ATP and ADP                which contain one or two ammonias in the coordination  sphere.                  Because ammonia in the coordination sphere lowers affinity when                 the ammonia is in contact with the protein, but should have                     little effect when it faces the solvent, the dissociation                       constants of these complexes will tell which portion of the metal               ion coordination sphere contacts the enzyme, and which faces the                solvent.  The complexes to be characterized are: 1) the 12                      isomers of monoamminechromium ATP and the expected corresponding                isomers containing ADP. 2) the apparent 10 isomers of cis-                      diamminechromium ATP, and the corresponding ADP isomers,3) the                  two expected isomers of trans-diamminechromium ATP or ADP.  As an               aid to characterizing these isomers, they will try to                           crystallize the two isomers of monoamminechromium                               pyrophosphate,and prepare the corresponding tripolyphosphate                    complexes.  They will also try to crystallize one of the                        enantiomers of cis-diamminechromium pyrophosphate (where water as               well as ammonia is cis) by use of a chiral anion or cation, or a                chiral solvent. Knowledge of the signs of the CD spectra of these               isomers will help characterize the cis-diamminechromium                         nucleotide complexes. These chromium complexes, once                            characterized. will be used to map the active sites of                          hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, and                              phosphofructokinase, all of which accept tetraaquochromium ATP as               a substrate.",
