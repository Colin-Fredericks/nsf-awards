The unpredictability is manifested by complex                                   problems unexpectedly becoming simple and                                       vice versa, by new states of matter that                                        appear, by new methods for controlling or                                       engineering plasmas unexpectedly becoming                                       possible, or by the plasma spontaneously self-                                  organizing itself into a coherent structure.                                    The present research concentrates on two                                        areas of nonlinear dynamics where few results                                   are currently available: (a) the interaction of                                 intrinsic stochasticity with self-consistent                                    properties; and (b) stochasticity in multi-                                     dimensional systems.  Some progress has been                                    made on the first topic in applying the ideas                                   to sheath heating in r.f. discharges.  This has                                 both led to new fundamental understanding                                       and practical possibilities of improving r.f.                                   plasma processing, to new understanding of                                      plasma loss in electron cyclotron heated                                        plasmas, and to the containment of                                              electromagnetic radiation in periodic guiding                                   systems.  The present work is concentrating                                     on investigation of multi-degree-of-freedom                                     systems using digital phase locked loops                                        (DPLL).  A single loop has already been                                         studied and shown how it can be designed to                                     optimize locking ability.  Interconnected                                       systems of oscillators have many applications                                   including achieving higher power from                                           microwave devices by combining the output of                                    several synchronized oscillators have also                                      been used as models in neurophysiology.                                         Interconnected systems of DPLLs offer a                                         convenient way to experimentally and                                            numerically study the phenomenology of these                                    systems since DPLLs are probably the                                            simplest system with locking behavior.  Since                                   digital systems are described by mappings, it                                   is computationally very efficient to study these                                systems as opposed to a system of ordinary                                      differential equations.",
