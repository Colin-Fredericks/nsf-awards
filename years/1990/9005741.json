 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well recognized that one of the most                                      computationally intensive problems encountered in                               the analysis and simulation of electric power systems                           if the transient stability problem.  Hence it is this                           area in which the high speed parallel and vector                                computers being made available today, will find the                             most applicability in the near and distant future.  One                         current trend in increasing the computational power                             of digital computing engines is to use inexpensive                              moderate speed processors and medium to large scale                             parallelism (10-1000 processors) such as the Sequent                            Balance, Encore Multimax, Intel iPSC, BBN Butterfly.                            Another trend is to use the more expensive high                                 speed vector processors and small scale parallelism                             (1-10) such as the CRAY and IBM vector processors                               with parallel pipelines, while there are other                                  computers with a foot in both camps, such as the                                Alliant.                                                                                                                                                        Frequency domain based algorithms, rather than                                  traditional time domain algorithms, display three                               important characteristics which have the potential for                          utilizing the specialist architectures in the machines                          above.  First, frequency domain techniques often lead                           to algorithms which are very naturally parallelizable,                          whereas time domain algorithms suffer from                                      precedent relationships which are inherent in                                   numerical integration schemes and limit the amount                              of exploitable parallelism.  Second, frequency domain                           techniques applied to power system dynamics                                     problems, often result in algorithms which are rich in                          highly vectorizable inner product calculations,                                 contrasting the time domain algorithms, in which                                code vectorization is extremely limited.  Third,                                frequency domain data compression can be easily                                 exploited.",
