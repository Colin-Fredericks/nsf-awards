 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the area of control of structural                           vibrations.  Flexible mechanical systems are widely used in                     spacecraft, buildings and bridges, material processing                          devices, and elsewhere.  Vibration of such systems limits                       their utility in many applications.  This project addresses                     this topic and focuses on the modeling, analysis, and                           experimental evaluation of noncolocated vibration control                       of flexible mechanical systems.  It utilizes the time delay                     approach to eliminate structural instabilities.  The                            research comprises four phases, including (1) formulation                       of a noncolocated control system in the frequency domain,                       (2) development of the time delay approach for noncolocated                     control, (3) analysis of the noncolocated control system                        and design of stabilizing controllers, and (4) experimental                     verification of the control system model and time delay                         approach.  This is a multidisciplinary problem requiring                        expertise in dynamics, structural analysis, and control                         system design.",
