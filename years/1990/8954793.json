 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of this project is to model a collaborative                 strategy for infusing significant applications of modern                        technologies in the teaching of mathematics, K-12, in two                       northeast Georgia rural school systems served by the University                 of Georgia (UGA).  Forty-five (45) selected mathematics                         teachers who will serve as Leader Teachers (LTs) will work                      intensively, with University mathematicians, scientists,                        mathematics and science educators and master teachers over a                    period of two years.  They will be grouped by teaching level,                   grades K-4, 5-8 and 9-12, and will complete specially designed                  mathematics and applied science content courses, teaching and                   curriculum implementation courses, a supervised internship and                  two research seminars during 2 six-week summer sessions and                     academic years.  The mathematics content will emphasize real-                   life problems, having heavy emphasis on problems with science                   components.  In this manner, the teachers, in particular those                  of grades K-8, will experience the integration of mathematics                   and science, emphasizing the applications of mathematics.                                                                                                       Based on their studies and the implementation experiences in                    their own classrooms, the LTs will develop, with the help of                    the project staff, four inservice workshop packages for each of                 the teaching levels.  These LTs will work in teams and conduct                  the staff development workshops for their colleagues, called                    School Partners (SPs), and provide continuing classroom support                 for these SPs over the next two years of the project.  Every                    teacher of mathematics, K-12, in these two districts will be                    involved in this project as either a Lead Teacher or a School                   Partner.  Wherever possible, the LT will work with teachers in                  his or her own school.                                                                                                                                          The University of Georgia, Greene and Walton Counties as well                   as the Apple Corporation have cost-shared a very large part of                  the cost of the total project.  Sufficient computers will be                    provided to implement this project in a realistic and                           appropriate way.  Content course syllabi, grade-level teaching                  resources, inservice workshop packages and descriptive and                      technical reports will be produced as a result of this project.                                                                                                 The large amount of cost-sharing is a virtual match on a dollar                 for dollar basis to the NSF request, with funds coming from                     UGA, the counties, Apple Computer Corp and State of Georgia                     Eisenhower money.",
