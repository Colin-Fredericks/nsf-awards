 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in low cost, benchtop Gas Chromatograph/Mass                Spectrometer systems offer new approaches to undergraduate                      education in chemistry.  The objective of this project is the                   enhancement of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the                    institution through the inclusion of extensive laboratory                       experience in concepts and techniques of GC/MS.  The addition of                GC/MS has affected a broad range of courses including                           Instrumental Analysis, Microscale Organic Laboratories and                      Environmental Chemistry.  In addition, students participate in                  laboratory-based studies, involving independent projects and                    undergraduate honor's research.  The project has been designed to               introduce students to new chemical and technological advances in                the component or hyphenated technique, while making basic                       concepts of mass spectrometry clear in a simple, rational and                   interesting manner.                                                                                                                                             Modern GC/MS methodology, currently used in industrial chemical                 laboratories is being utilized to solve a variety of problems in                analytical and organic laboratory courses.  Thus, students are                  exposed to equipment and techniques that they may reasonably                    expect to use in their future professional careers.  The project                also includes featuring the equipment in the departmental                       sponsored workshops and demonstrations for high school science                  teachers and senior students.                                                                                                                                   The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
