 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post-event investigation project to learn                             engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                    1989).                                                                                                                                                          The Loma Prieta earthquake induced munerous incidents of                        damage to both ground-based and elevated tanks, and even to                     some of the retrofitted tanks.  In particular, site                             amplification of long period ground motion components appears                   to be the cause of large amplitude sloshing and associated                      damage to tanks built on Bay Mud.  In this project the data                     collected will be analyzed to evaluate the performance of tank                  structures.  The tasks include:  (1) collection of data and                     documentation of the damage sustained by ground-based water                     and petroleum storage tanks and by elevated water storage                       tanks, (2) calculation of the dynamic response of                               representative tanks and correlation of the computed response                   with observed damage or lack of damage, (3) study of the                        effects of site amplification of long period components on the                  sloshing phenomenon and on rocking motion of tanks founded on                   Bay Mud, (4) study of the damage to retrofitted tanks to                        deduce the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the implemented                   retrofit mechanisms, and (5) comparison of induced seismic                      forces with those specified by available codes and standards                    such as API 650, AWWA 100 and UBC.                                                                                                                              By comparison of the predicted response with actual behavior                    under earthquake loading, the analytical methods developed for                  response calculation of tanks will be refined and improved                      design procedures will be developed.",
