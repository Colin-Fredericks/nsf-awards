 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed to train 20 science supervisors and                    80 science teachers to replicate and implement specific                         experiential methodologies using applications of the built                      environment (bridges, buildings and beams) to increase the                      interest of middle school students in the study of science                      and mathematics.  These methodologies were developed over the                   past 15 years by Dr. Mario Salvadori.  The program, which                       will be conducted in several phases at the City College of                      The City University of New York, focuses on an experimental                     training model for instructors.                                                                                                                                 For the summer of 1990, The City College and participating                      districts will identify and recruit 20 appropriate science                      supervisory candidates for Phase I of the program.  At the                      same time curriculum materials, hands-on activities, and                        teaching strategies will be refined for this phase of the                       project.  Upon the completion of these steps, selected                          supervisors will be trained by Dr. Salvadori and his                            assistants using these materials on the built environment.                      They will teach both content and methodology to the                             participants.  This comprises Phase II of the program.                                                                                                          In Phase III, six qualified supervisors, chosen from the                        initial 20, will train 60 selected middle school teachers (in                   three groups) in the Salvadori program replicating their own                    training.  Simultaneously, Dr. Salvadori will train an                          additional complement of 20 teachers.  Beginning in 1990, the                   workshops are scheduled for 4-hours, after school, once a                       week for 15-weeks.  Participants will earn 4 graduate                           credits.                                                                                                                                                        In Phase IV of the program, 60 teachers taught by the                           supervisors and the 20 teachers taught directly by                              Dr. Salvadori will implement the program in their own                           schools.  They will receive support in their schools on an                      ongoing basis from project staff, and will be invited to                        periodic conferences at The City College to reinforce the                       basic ideas fostered by the program.                                                                                                                            Throughout the program a thorough evaluation will be                            conducted to ascertain the effect and transferability of the                    Salvadori program to schools where Dr. Salvadori is not                         directly involved.                                                                                                                                              Cost sharing in an amount of $590,514 equals 205% of the NSF                    award.",
