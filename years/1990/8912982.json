 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar flares constitute the sudden release of energy on the sun's               surface.  They become more frequent and stronger on an 11 year                  cycle (also called the sunspot cycle).  They are caused by the                  gradual storing up and followed by the sudden release of energy in              magnetic fields that accompany the sunspot cycle.  Understanding                the origin of the sun's magnetic fields, the storage of energy by               them, and the release of that energy during flares is a poorly                  understood subject.                                                                                                                                             The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to observe magnetic fields             in sunspot regions during the forthcoming solar sunspot maximum,                using a newly developed magneto-optic filter (consisting of a                   resonance cell filled with potassium vapor in a strong magnetic                 field).  This filter permits the measurement of both transverse and             longitudinal components of solar magnetic fields.  The PI expects               that his work will further our understanding of the magnetic fields             accompanying solar flares and test the hypothesis that the energy               released during flares results from stressed or sheared magnetic                field configurations.",
