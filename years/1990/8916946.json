 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and dynamics of complex biopolymers in solution                   are subjects of considerable debate.  Some researchers believe                  that proteins exhibit large structural fluctuations and that                    these fluctuations influence both the protein's structure and                   its reactivity whereas others suggest that a static picture of                  protein structure is more relevant for the prediction of                        biological function.  Still others suggest that spin glass                      theories provide the correct potential energy description with                  the potential energy surface exhibiting ultrametric properties                  (i.e., a hierarchy of energy minima within energy minima)                       whereas others believe the ultrametricity is not the correct                    description.  This project will study biophysical systems in                    an attempt to resolve these questions.                                                                                                                          It has recently been shown that synthetic peptides provide                      excellent models for the structure, dynamics and folding of                     proteins.  In time-domain or pulsed electron spin resonance                     (ESR), now emerging as a leading technology for studying                        dynamics and relaxation process in biological systems, the                      temporal range which can be studied covers the majority of                      protein internal motions.  In this project, time domain ESR                     studies will be carried out on a series of spin-labelled                        peptides.  A theory for spin relaxation has been developed for                  alpha-helical peptides which predicts that the spin-spin decay                  will follow a power law profile when the peptide is in the                      region of the alpha-helix-random coil transition.                               Conformation of this prediction will be a major step toward                     resolving the origin of power law relaxation processes in                       proteins.",
