 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex differences in brain and behavior are a result of the                  perinatal hormonal environment.  Exposure to testicular androgens               during critical developmental periods can permanently alter the                 anatomy, biochemistry and physiology of the brain.  A major                     question is how do the gonadal steroids regulate the                            differentiation of the brain at the cellular level.  Dr. Tobet                  has identified two sex-specific monoclonal antibodies which are                 influenced by perinatal androgen treatment.  He will use these                  monoclonal antibodies as markers to follow selective molecular                  changes in development which are hormonally dependent.  Dr. Tobet               will pay special attention to the time course of antigen                        expression since it is believed that temporal synchronization                   between brief increases in gonadal steroid signals and transient                neural changes induce sexual differentiation of the brain.  This                work will provide a greater understanding of the early                          manifestations of steroid actions which lead to normal brain                    development.  Moreover, the results could help unravel the                      abnormal events that underlie major birth defects involving the                 sexual differentiation process.  Finally, the importance of these               hormonal events is underscored by evidence of sex differences and               androgen influences in the susceptibility to certain syndromes,                 learning disorders and neurological disorders.",
