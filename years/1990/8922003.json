 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser diagnostics can provide accurate measurements with                        temporal and spatial resolutions essential to establish a                       scientific base for understanding fundamental combustion                        processes.  It is proposed to conduct phase specific,                           multiple-point and multiple-component measurements of a unique                                                                                                  nondriven periodic jet diffusion flame.  The data obtained                      will provide insights into the dynamic structure of such                        flames, including an assessment of the chaotic aspects.                         Planar flow imaging including laser induced fluorescence,                       reactive  Mie scattering and soot Mie scattering will be                        employed to characterize the relationship between the flow and                                                                                                  flame.  Multiple-point temperature measurements using thin                      filament pyrometry and planar LIF thermometry will be                           developed and applied to jet diffusion flames.  Techniques for                                                                                                  simultaneous imaging of the temperature soot and multiple                       species will also be investigated as a means of quantifying                     the interaction of the flame and flow vortices.                                                                                                                 This project brings together specialties in laser diagnostics                   from industry and specialties in combustion from a university.                                                                                                  The project is a continuation of a research program to study                    the dynamic structure of jet diffusion flames involving                         scientists and engineers from the Air Force Wright Research                     and Development Center, the National Institute of Standards                     and Technology and The University of Iowa.  Funding for the                     work is shared with the US Air Force.",
