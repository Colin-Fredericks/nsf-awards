 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nectar is the most common floral reward produced by                        angiosperms, but little is known about the effect of nectar                     production rate on pollination success.  This investigation will                focus on this relationship for the hummingbird-pollinated                       monacarpic plant Ipomopsis aggregata.  The primary question of                  the study involves the overall effect of nectar production rate                 on fitness:  1) Do plants with higher nectar production rates                   have greater pollination success?  Preliminary field evidence                   indicates that this does occur (at least for male function                      pollination success), so study of the causal mechanisms of this                 effect will be profitable.  This question will answered by:  2)                 How does NPR affect standing crop?  3) How does standing crop                   affect visitation behavior?  4) How does visitation behavior                    affect pollination success?                                                         The study will investigate these questions with a variety of                mutually reinforcing approaches, including computer simulation,                 observation of the effects of natural variation in NPR, and                     manipulative experiments in the field and aviary.  Estimates of                 the effect of each mechanism in isolation can be combined to                    produce an estimate of pollination success that can be compared                 with benchmark values from Question 1, testing the adequacy of                  the mechanisms proposed.  The research will increase                            understanding, not only of the fitness consequences of variation                in NPR, but the mechanisms through which such effects may be                    expressed.",
