 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been shown that isoleucine and valine supply                             propionate units used specifically for the biosynthesis of                      the ethyl-branched juvenile hormones (JHs).  Insect corpora                     allata (CA) which do not metabolize them readily (the CA of                     Lepidoptera) secrete propionate and ethyl-branched JHs.  This                   research will extend these studies and determine what allows                    the CA to violate the rules of sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis                     and to incorporate propionyl-CoA into this pathway.  The                        metabolism of \u0131U-14c! isoleucine will be examined in several                    tissues of insects which make the ethyl-branched JHs vs.                        those that produce only JH III.  These data are important for                   interpreting metabolic differences between species.  In                         addition, the metabolism of \u0131U-14c! isoleucine in isolated                      mitochondria will also be studied.  This work will determine                    whether or not there is an efficient transport system for                       exporting propionyl-CoA from the mitochondria.  Carnitine                       propionyl transferase and methyl citrate formation will be                      examined as likely possibilities for propionyl CoA transport.                   If this phenomenon cannot be explained by a unique system for                   propionate transport, the possibility will be investigated                      that certain enzymes might be located in different                              subcellular organelles than those in which they are generally                   held to exist.                                                                                                                                                  Juvenile hormones are a group of structurally related                           compounds secreted by members of the class Insecta and which                    possess morphogenetic and gonadotropic activity.  It is                         important to have a basic knowledge of the metabolic pathways                   involved to understand why and how insects are able to                          synthesize these hormones.  Knowledge of the biochemical                        details of this pathway could point the way towards synthesis                   of chemicals which specifically inhibit it.  These chemicals                    would be antihormones (and probably, therefore, specific                        insecticides) to the order of insects that includes moths,                      which are some of the most damaging of crop pests.",
