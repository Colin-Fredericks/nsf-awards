 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kormendy, one of the worlds leading experts in high resolu-                 tion spectroscopy and photometry of early type galaxies, is here                funded to make a systematic investigation of the cores of early-                type galaxies.  This work is made possible by the excellent                     seeing at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, which exhibits star               images a factor of two smaller than elsewhere.  For the first                   time, cores will be resolved in many galaxies.  A variety of                    problems of core structure are to be investigated.  Surface                     photometry, stellar rotation, and velocity dispersion measure-                  ments will be obtained for galaxies over a wide range of luminos-               ity.  This program will provide basic galaxy scaling laws: corre-               lations between characteristic size, central density, velocity                  dispersion and luminosity.  These will provide basic constraints                for theories of galaxy formation; for example, they may show that               lower-luminosity ellipticals formed with more dissipation than                  high-luminosity ellipticals.  \"Second parameter\" effects in these               correlations, i.e., the origin of the scatter, will be studied.                 Dynamical modeling using Richstone and Tremaine's maximum entropy               code will be used to study anisotropies in the velocity distribu-               tion and to measure mass-to-light ratios as a function of galaxy                luminosity.  Surprisingly, dust is detected in over half of the                 galaxies already surveyed.  This will be illustrated in an atlas                of photographs.  Dust distributions will provide constraints on                 the intrinsic shapes of ellipticals, fueling scenarios for cen-                 tral black holes, and X-ray cooling flows.  Other nuclear phenom-               ena which may be investigated include extra nuclei superimposed                 on cores, dynamical evolution and collapse in the smallest cores,               and the formation of nuclear black holes.  A search for supermas-               sive black holes will be made by looking for large gradients in                 central rotation and velocity dispersion curves.  Evidence for                  central mass concentration has already been found in at least                   five galaxies.",
