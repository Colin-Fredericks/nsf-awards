 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grounding and subsequent leakage of petroleum from the Bahia                Paraiso into the relatively pristine area of Arthur Harbor,                     Antarctic raised the spectre of a major ecological disaster                     caused by man's activities in polar climates.  In response to                   initial reports of the release of substantial amounts of                        hydrocarbons to the environment, a multidisciplinary team of                    biologists, chemists and microbiologists was dispatched to the                  area.  The environmental chemistry component of this program was                directed at determining the extent of hydrocarbon contamination                 and its ultimate fate in the environment.  Sampling included                    tissues (invertebrates and macroalgae), sediments, and water in                 both impacted as well as control areas far from the spill site.                 Concurrent biological effects programs were initiated by other                  investigators.  This proposal involves the chemical analysis of                 samples collected during the field portion of this survey as well               as follow.up monitoring of selected sites approximately one year                later.  The analytical program has several major components                     including:  (l) characterization of fluids leaking from the                     vessel by molecular and isotopic analysis; (2) development of                   unique fingerprints to identify environmental hydrocarbons                      derived from the spill; (3) determination of the partitioning of                hydrocarbons between the atmosphere, water, sediments and                       organisms after release to the environment; (4) documentation of                the redistribution of hydrocarbons in the environment with time                 since the spill; (5) identifying and uniquely fingerprinting                    other sources of hydrocarbons in the area including natural                     biological sources (macroalgae, plankton, etc.) and (6) providing               supportive analytical data for biological effects studies.                      Longer range goals of this program are to develop a broad                       understanding of the sources, fate and distribution of                          hydrocarbons in polar climates, as well as assessing the chemical               contamination derived from field stations.  These studies will                  assist in a better evaluation of the significance and impact of                 petroleum releases to the environment associated with man's                     activities in polar regions.",
