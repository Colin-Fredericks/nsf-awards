 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research has three purposes.  The first is to describe the way in           which experienced high school biology, chemistry, and physics teachers          think about their discipline, their students, and their teaching.  The          second is to identify relationships between the teachers' thinking,             their planning and teaching practices, and the conceptual learning of           students in their classrooms.  The third is to develop techniques of            video data collection in high school science classrooms and computer-           based video and audio data analysis to support the above purposes.                                                                                              In a pilot study, video data collection and computer-based analysis             procedures will be developed and refined by observing three teachers,           one in each discipline.  In the full study eighteen teachers will be            studied, six in each discipline.  Each teacher will be observed teaching        three target units each of about 2 weeks duration.  Each teacher will           also be interviewed at intervals throughout the project; at the start           and end of the study about the way they think about teaching science to         high school students, at the end of each unit to clarify classroom              events, and in the final year of the project to provide feedback about          the analysis of data.  Finally, each class of students will be given a          pre-test and post-test for each unit.                                                                                                                           This research will provide information about different ways in which            eperienced teachers think about the nature of their discipline, the ways        in which their students learn science, and the effect this has on               instruction.  Further, it will describe various patterns of practice;           ways in which teachers' thoughts relate to their classroom practices and        to the conceptual learning of their students.  Finally, it will detail          similarities and differences in these patterns of practice for biology,         chemistry, and physics teachers.  These detailed descriptions will              provide a level of understanding of science teaching which will                 significantly enhance the quality of preservice and inservice science           teacher education and, ultimely, science teaching in the nation's high          schools.",
