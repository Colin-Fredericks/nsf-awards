 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do increases in women's participation in the market economy                 tend to be associated with increases in the number of households                maintained by women alone?  In order to answer this question,                   more accurate measures are needed of long run changes in both                   labor force composition and household structure.  Yet, most                     studies of this crucial interrelationship in the U.S. are limited               to the post World War II period, when the overall picture was                   greatly complicated by the dramatic expansion of federal welfare                programs.                                                                                                                                                       To remedy this shortcoming, this project will a develop and                     analyze data on the growth of female labor force participation                  as affected by the percentage of families maintained by women                   alone.  The data will be assembled for five rapidly                             industrializing towns in Massachusetts between 1880 and 1910.                   The study will explore the economic consequences for women of                   different ages, family composition, and ethnic background.  This                will involve the collection and analysis of manuscript census                   data, tax and poor relief records that will provide new, accurate               estimates of female labor-force participation, household                        structure, and economic welfare.  In addition, the study will                   also provide some benchmark estimates of similar nationwide                     trends based on analysis of the U.S. Census Public Use Samples                  for 1900 and 1910.  This project is important because it will                   provide a better understanding of the factors affecting the                     growth of women in the labor force, particularly the effect of                  female headed households.",
