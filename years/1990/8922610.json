 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of Nash equilibrium is the basic analytic tool of                   non-cooperative Game Theory.  All applications of non-cooperative               games, which include a sizable fraction of the work in economic                 theory, invariably rely on Nash equilibria.  A typical                          application consists of modeling a competitive situation as a                   game and then narrowing down the set of possible outcomes by                    applying the equilibrium conditions.  If the remaining properties               all share a certain property, then that property is viewed as a                 consequence of the analysis.                                                                                                                                    This project is concerned with two aspects of the above-described               process.  First, there is the issue of equilibrium \"refinement\",                i.e., the formulation of conditions which \"sensible\" equilibria                 presumably must satisfy.  Equilibrium refinements have been                     motivated by two main ideas.  One is \"strategic stability\" or                   robustness in the face of logical calculations that the players                 may perform, and the other is \"evolutionary stability\", or                      robustness in the face of a dynamic process of \"survival of the                 fittest\".  Second, there is the issue of the modeling itself:                   Are the conclusions from equilibrium analysis distorted by the                  simplifications required in real-life situations?  If so, what                  should be done?                                                                                                                                                 Specifically, the project reformulates the definition of                        strategic stability so that it can be applied in a more direct                  manner; axiomatizes the solution concept; and derives additional                properties satisfied by the solution concept.   It extends the                  definition of evolutionary stability used by biologists to                      general games and studies its relationship with strategic                       stability.   As regards the problem of modeling, the project                    examines ways of relaxing assumptions of common knowledge and of                unlimited complexity in players' strategies.  Finally, the two                  themes - of equilibrium refinement and of the sensitivity of                    equilibrium analysis to the formulation of models - are combined                in order to provide a practical analysis of real competitive                    interactions.  These are fundamental and extremely difficult                    problems.  The results of this research should provide new,                     powerful analytic tools for economic theory.",
