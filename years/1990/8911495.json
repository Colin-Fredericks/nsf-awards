 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"tape recorder\" analogy of magnetic reversal patterns frozen                into oceanic crust has been one of the major discoveries in the                 last three decades of earth science research. Though marine                     magnetic lineations have been identified back to M38, none in the               Pacific that are older than M25 have yet been proven conclusively               to result from field reversals.  Part of the difficulty in                      evaluating these oldest anomalies results from their                            characteristically low amplitudes and apparently short periods.                 Johnson and his colleagues propose to construct a magnetometer                  that will be towed near the seafloor, and being closer to the                   source of the lineations than conventional shipboard or airborne                instruments, this device will detect especially subtle features.                During 22 days of surveying, Johnson and his colleagues will also               gather topographic measurements of the oceanic crust and the                    seafloor with seismic reflection profiles and SEABEAM swath maps,               respectively.  Three regions will be surveyed in the western                    Pacific where post-M25 magnetic lineations are known from                       previous studies. These new data will allow modelling studies to                compare details among the three study areas.  If similarities in                wavelength and amplitude are found, they will strongly support                  the interpretation that they are true records of magnetic field                 reversals.  If future ocean drilling recovers and dates the                     sediments resting on these lineations, the marine magnetic                      reversal time scale could be extended several millions of years                 further back into the Jurassic.",
