 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at organizing complex design projects               in order to perform faster product development.  A variation of                 Steward's design structure matrix is used to represent both the                 sequence of and the technical relationships among the many design               tasks to be performed.  These relationships define the \"technical               structure\" of a design project.  Analytical techniques to find                  alternative sequences and definitions of the design tasks will be               developed, offering opportunities to speed development progress                 by improved coordination and information transfer.  These                       algorithms will consider the technical structure of a project in                order to identify which tasks should be resequenced and which                   tasks should be redefined or split into smaller sub-tasks to                    avoid development bottlenecks.  These techniques will be                        developed into a strategy for design management which can                       significantly reduce the overall project complexity by                          reorganizing the few critical tasks.  It is expected that this                  research will benefit not only new design tasks that have never                 been structured before but also long-standing, often repeated                   design tasks that may have drifted into poor organization                       patterns over many years.",
