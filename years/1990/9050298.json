 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama at Birmingham will conduct a two-year program         to stimulate school-wide mathematics achievement in grades 4-6 of four          school systems within the metropolitan Birmingham area.  The term               \"school-wide\" is used here in a technical sense: the model is based on a        school as a \"unit of change\", the smallest unit necessary to sustain            change over the long term, and \"school-wide\" involvement means that at          least 75% of the teachers will participate.  The project features a six-        week summer institute on strengthening content knowledge through a              problem-solving approach, the nature of children's mathematical                 thinking, increasing pedagogical skills, and materials development.             Throughout the following academic year, the project staff will visit            participant classrooms to facilitate implementation.  A leadership              training workshop consisting of five days in the second summer and five         days during the next academic year will prepare the participants for            outreach.  A total of 40 teachers will participate in the six-week              institute, and 21 of these teachers will participate in the leadership          training.  The University of Alabama at Birmingham and the four local           school districts have contributed an amount equal to 19% of the National        Science Foundation request.",
