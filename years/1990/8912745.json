 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is funding a continuation of the                  research of Dr. James A. Marshall. Dr. Marshall will continue                   his development of new ways to control the stereochemistry in                   the synthesis of complex systems.  These will provide the new                   tools required by the increasing complexity of the compounds                    needed by our agriculture and industry.                                                                                                                         The research will explore the scope of reactions in which                       nonracemic vinyloxiranes serve as key intermediates for the                     synthesis of subunits found in various polypropionate and                       related natural products.  The experiments are designed to                      reveal intrinsic steric preferences and explore the role of                     directing groups in these reactions.  A variety of nucleophilic                 reagents will be tested including nonracemic cuprates and                       allylmetallic compounds.  By the proper selection of double                     bond geometry, epoxide stereochemistry and reagent                              sterochemistry it should be possible to exercise considerable                   control over the formation of multiple stereocenters.                           Methodology will also be explored for transforming the products                 of the foregoing reactions into natural products and analogs                    with potential antitumor, antibiotic, and immunosuppressive                     properties.",
