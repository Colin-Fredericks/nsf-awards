 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reduction of mechanical systems with symmetry will be                      pursued.  The problems to be studied were motivated by recent                   advances in stability theory and the theory of classical                        relativistic fields.  The block diagonalization technique to be                 used is based on a recent solution to the problem of separation                 of rotational and internal modes.  The general geometric theory                 underlying this technique will be investigated.  Recent advances                in classical field theory based on reduction ideas will be                      exploited to develop corresponding covariant reduction theory and               related topics.                                                                      This project will extend our understanding of the stability                of relativistic magnetic, electrical, and gravitational fields.                 These fields, which may describe motion, are said to be stable if               under various sorts of perturbations the system maintains its                   basic nature in some way.  These have come under intense                        mathematical scrutiny for several decades and this project will                 extend our knowledge of them.",
