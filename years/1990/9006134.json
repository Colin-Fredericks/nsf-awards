 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear nonautonomous differential equations have                        attracted the attention of many mathematicians and mathematical                 scientists.  The description and modeling of physical phenomena                 frequently involve such equations.  Progress has not been easy                  but topological and variational methods have been relatively                    successful in yielding existence and multiplicity information                   regarding boundary value problems and periodic solutions.                       However, progress has been much slower in our understanding of                  the dynamics of such systems. Many classes of these problems have               a rather sparse literature, perhaps due to the fact that the                    topological degree and variational methods usually yield little                 or no information on dynamics.  The proposed research will                      develop a unified approach to these difficulties through the                    application of homotopy index theory and analytical methods to                  parameter dependent skew product flows associated with the                      nonautonomous differential equations,as well as topological                     degree, semigroup methods, and monotone iterative techniques.                   Continuation methods for asymptotic stability, existence of                     bounded solutions and other dynamical questions will be                         developed.",
