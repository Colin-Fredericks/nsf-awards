 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loras College is revising its curriculum for the calculus based                 introductory physics course.  The model for the calculus-based                  course has the following highlighted features:  (1)  incorporation              of MBL components from the Dickinson College Workshop Physics                   Project, (2) IEEE-488 based interface experiments in electricity,               magnetism and electronics, (3) ten spreadsheet study modules                    emphasizing contemporary and ocmputational topics, and (4)                      integrated tutorial, communications and data analysis exercises.                The addition of five MAC IIcx systems with Microsoft Works, six                 IEEE based Keithley stations, a networked Laser writer, and five                copies of SuperCalc3 spreadsheet complement the Apple IIe systems               on hand and allow implementation of courseware already developed.               Using locally generated funding and personal time, a complete                   Laboratory Manual, interface experiments, and ten spreadsheet                   modules have been developed by the Loras College Physics                        Department.  The present project permits immediate implementation,              further classs testing, and publication of new materials as called              for in Phase III of the Introductory University Physics Project.                One IBM Ps/2 system will permit the development of transportable                versions  of the spreadsheet modules and one copy of Mathematica                will permit the development of the next aspect of the curriculum                revision, incorporation of math solvers in the syllabus of the                  calculus based course.  The college is matching the award with an               equal amount of funds.//",
