 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ambitious proposal to investigate the impact of consumer             product safety laws and regulation on household accident rates.                 Historically, industrialized countries have adopted a standard-                 setting approach to the problem of product safety.  Previous                    research, however, has found little or not effect of these                      regulations.  The failure to find significant effects may be due                to limitations of available data or to aspects of the analyses                  used.  These factors will be controlled in the proposed project.                                                                                                The primary objective of the study is to determine whether product              safety standards have decreased morbidity and mortality rates in                several industrialized countries (U.S., U.K., Japan, and the                    Netherlands).  The research will improve on previous studies by                 (1) analyzing a broader and more complete set of data on accidents              and (2) employing more powerful and flexible statistical methods.               As a result, the project will generate results that could resolve               disputes over the appropriate form of product safety regulations                in the United States.  Therefore, this project will be valuable                 both for producing useful data on product safety and for the policy             implications of those data.",
