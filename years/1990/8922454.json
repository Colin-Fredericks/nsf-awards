 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Drs. William G. Lynch, C. Konrad Gelbke                     and others of Michigan State University to collaborate in                       physics research with Drs. Uli Lynen, W. Trautmann and J.                       Pochodzalla of the University of Frankfurt and the Gesellschaft                 fuer \u001aSchwerionenforschung (GSI) at Darmstadt, FRG.  They are                   \u001ainvestigating the properties of multifragment breakup                          mechanisms in order to obtain information about the equation                    of state and liquid.gas phase transition of dilute nuclear                      matter.  MSU has a compact and highly granular intermediate                     mass fragment detection array, the MINIBALL.  Measurements                      with this device require small halo.free Krypton beams at an                    energy level and quality not available in the U.S.  Such                        beams will be available in the near future at GSI, which will                   be the best facility of its kind in the world; however, there                   is no array similar to MINIBALL at GSI.  The collaboration,                     therefore, is based on transporting the array to Germany to                     bring these two complementary state of the art devices                          together.                                                                                                                                                       Calculations suggest that multifragmentation may occur in                       heavy ion reactions over a wide range of incident energies.                     Few measurements to date have addressed the properties of                       collisions which lead to the production of many intermediate                    mass fragments.  MINIBALL was constructed to look for                           intermediate mass fragments and provide information about                       highly excited and dilute nuclear matter.  In conjunction                       with the ALADIN spectrometer, it will be possible to measure                    multifragmentation processes for Krypton induced reactions                      over the energy range 50 to 1000 MeV.  Studies in this range                    will complement the ongoing research effort at MSU where                        reactions at lower energies are being explored.  The results                    of their initial survey of the Kr.Nb system will have a                         significant impact on the directions of subsequent heavy ion                    experiments.  Once incident energies at which multifragment                     breakup mechanisms are dominant have been identified, detailed                  comparisons to dynamical and statistical multifragmentation                     models will be performed.",
