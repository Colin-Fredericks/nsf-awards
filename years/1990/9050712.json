 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Diode Array (DA) UV-Visible spectrophotometer has greatly                     enhanced the undergraduate laboratory experience.  The instrument               is used in three primary laboratory environments:  general                      chemistry laboratory, instrumental analysis, and independent                    student research.  In the general laboratory, students use the DA               UV-Vis. spectrophotometer in the analysis of the manganese                      content of steel.  This allows students the opportunity to use                  modern, computer based instrumentation in the first chemistry                   course.  This helps to demonstrate to the students the role,                    pervasiveness and power of instrumentation in chemistry.  In the                Instrumental Analysis course, a laboratory block of \"tandem                     techniques\" is integrated to demonstrate the additional                         information one can obtain from a tandem technique as compared to               the component techniques used independently.  In order to develop               a cohesive laboratory, it is necessary to include a combined                    spectroscopy-electrochemistry technique.  An ideal example is                   ultraviolet-visible spectroelectrochemistry which requires a DA                 UV-Vis. instrument.  The block of laboratories involving the                    student and comparison of tandem techniques with each other and                 with their individual component techniques provides broad                       exposure to, and appreciation for the advantages of tandem                      techniques.  Finally, undergraduate research is one of the best                 educational experiences for students, and the time they have for                it is limited.  Therefore, this project is to providing the most                effective instrumentation possible to ensure a productive,                      positive research experiences; the UV-Visible diode array                       spectrophotometer is used extensively in the summer research                    program as well as by student researchers during the academic                   year.                                                                                                                                                           The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
