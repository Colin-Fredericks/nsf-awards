 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) could saturate                           a transformer core and result in transformer stray flux                         heating.  Many such incidents have occurred during the                          March 1989 K-9 solar magnetic disturbance.  Stray flux                          distribution within a transformer is complicated and                            involves many factors.  A systematic three dimensional                          analysis of transformer flux distribution under GIC is                          proposed.  Magnetic fields everywhere inside a                                  transformer will be calculated.  Stray flux patterns as well                    as eddy currents for different transformer designs, core                        configurations will be analyzed and compared.  The                              objectives of this study are to reveal the fundamental                          transformer magnetization mechanism under the                                   influence of GIC, to assess potential stray flux heating                        possibilities of geologically vulnerable transformer units.                     The research findings will help utilities to justify the                        needs for mitigation actions on high risk units.                                Manufacturers may use the research results to review                            their design strategies and introduce possible design                           considerations to reduce GIC effects in the future.",
