 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provided the chemistry curriculum at the institution               with the powerful and modern analytical techniques of gas                       chromatography and mass spectrometry combined in a single                       instrument.  The instrument was integrated into the laboratory                  program at all levels, thereby benefitting approximately 200                    students each year.  The instrument is used for demonstration                   purposes in freshman chemistry; in other courses, integrating                   these analytical techniques into the curriculum is serving the                  following goals:  providing practical experience in obtaining and               interpreting mass spectral data; demonstrating the physical                     principles of GC/MS; hands-on experience with modern, computer-                 controlled instrumentation; and improving the scientific                        capabilities of undergraduate research projects.  Some                          experiments that can accomplish the above goals involve the                     identification of unknowns, analysis of complex mixtures of                     reactions, and the characterization of synthesized compounds in                 inorganic and organic chemistry.                                                                                                                                The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
