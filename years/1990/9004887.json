 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcitonin is a peptide hormone produced by special cells in               the mammalian thyroid gland and the ultimobranchial gland of                    birds and fish.  In mammals, the hormone is secreted into the                   bloodstream in response to a rise in blood calcium.  It travels                 to the kidney and bone where is acts on target cells that respond               by enhancing renal calcium excretion and reducing bone breakdown,               thereby lowering blood calcium back to normal.  Dr. Cooper has                  shown that calcitonin produces behavioral changes when it is                    introduced into the CNS.  Indeed, this peptide has profound                     effects on food and water intake, pain perception, and gastric                  acid secretion.  Yet, calcitonin has not been found naturally in                the brain, and circulating calcitonin cannot get through the                    blood-brain barrier.  Dr. Cooper suggests that a calcitonin-like                molecule is present in the CNS but has not been identified                      because it is different than the one produced in the periphery by               the thyroid hormone.  He will use structural analogs of                         calcitonin to isolate CNS receptors, and to determine whether                   more than one subtype of calcitonin receptor exists.  Dr. Cooper                will then compare the properties of the CNS and peripheral                      calcitonin receptors to determine their similarities and                        differences.  In addition, he will characterize the peptide                     sequences that when introduced into the CNS initiate feeding,                   drinking and gastric acid secretion.  This work will increase our               general understanding of how peptides act as chemical messengers                in the brain.  Moreover, potential usefulness of this work for                  the development of pharmacological agents for pain control and                  gastric acid secretion is noted.",
