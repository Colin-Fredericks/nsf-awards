 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spray combustion serves as the source of a substantial portion                  of the energy production in the United States and as the basic                  for virtually all the major propulsion systems.  Phase Doppler                  interferometry is now regularly used as the diagnostic tool                     for studying non reacting sprays in the absence of swirl.                       This project deals with the research, development,                              manufacture, and application of this technique for the                          measurement of two phase transport and air-fuel interaction in                  liquid spray combustion systems.  The objective of Phase II of                  this program, which are a requisite before this technique can                   be successfully applied to spray combustion systems, are:                            1.  To resolve the limitations associated with the                              application of the phase Doppler technique to liquid                            swirl spray combustion (LSSC) systems.                                          2.  To expand the capabilities of the phase Doppler                             instrument to more effectively analyze the turbulent                            transport processes associated with LSSC processes.                             3.  To thoroughly evaluate the new instrument for                               measurement of drop and gas transport in LSSC                                   environments.                                                                   4.  Develop and demonstrate a fully functional prototype                        instrument.                                                                                                                                                The technical approach to fulfill these objectives will be to                   resolve the current limitations, expand the capabilities,                       exhaustively test the advanced diagnostic technique by                          performing carefully designed experiments in non reacting and                   reacting conditions in a practical combustor, and develop a                     prototype of the new instrument.  Significant results of Phase                  II will be the development, manufacture, testing, and                           application of an advanced instrument for the complete                          diagnostic of spray combustion systems.  Potential application                  of an instrument which can be applied to the analysis of LSSC                   systems are numerous:  gas turbine engines for aircraft, power                  plant generation, furnaces for space heating, rocket engine                     combustors and incinerators for hazardous waste incineration.                   These applications account for more than 50% of the total                       energy consumption in the U.S.",
