 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the development of conceptual thought                and the ability to recall the past in infancy and early                         childhood.  To date, we still have little information about the                 way infants conceptualize the world or how long they can recall                 events that have happened to them.  The phenomenon known as child               amnesia, in which adults recall little or nothing about their                   early years, suggests that infants may not be able to recall                    events for very long.  At the same time, there is a small amount                of evidence suggesting that two-year-olds can recall events that                occurred when they were one year of age.  This research program                 will use deferred imitation, in which children are asked to                     imitate events they observed in the past, to measure recall in                  children too young to talk.  The expectation, based on pilot                    work, is that this research will demonstrate that the cause of                  childhood amnesia is not an inability to store and remember                     events as they occur in infancy.                                                                                                                                There has also been little experimental work on concept formation               in infancy.  It has been suggested that infants first form very                 simple concepts, of such things as dogs, chairs, and cars, and                  only later develop broader concepts of animals, furniture, and                  vehicles.  This research will use several techniques to                         investigate this hypothesis.  One procedure will use an object-                 manipulation task, in which one-year-olds show, by the order in                 which they touch objects put in front of them, whether they                     consider them to be related or not.  Another procedure will use                 an object-exploration task, in which the amount of exploration of               a new object is used to estimate whether the infant considers it                to be related to objects previously explored.  Based on work                    already accomplished, it is expected that infants' understanding                of concepts such as animals and vehicles will be found to be more               similar to those of older children and adults than has been                     thought traditionally to be the case.  The overall goal of the                  research is to provide a systematic body of knowledge and a                     coherent theory about the early foundations of thinking and                     remembering.",
