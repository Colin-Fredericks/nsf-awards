 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its amenability to experimental manipulation, and               the availability of methodologies for genetic analysis, the                     microcrustacean complex Daphnia pulex provides an outstanding                   model system for the study of the interfaces between population                 genetics, mating systems, molecular evolution, and ecology.  The                proposed work is concerned particularly with the mechanisms that                constrain the tempo and mode of microevolutionary change.  Each                 form of reproduction is thought to have unique advantages and                   disadvantages.  For example, species which reproduce by parental                gene exchange generate variable phenotypes each generation.                     These species can be adaptive in variable environments, but they                suffer from inbreeding depression, a significant problem in                     colonizing environments.  Species which reproduce without                       parental gene exchange are believed to be ideal colonizers, but                 they appear in some cases to be lacking in evolutionary                         flexibility and to be doomed to rapid extinction due to the rapid               build-up of mutational load.  Unfortunately, there are few good                 empirical data on any of these matters.                                              The proposed work will quantify these types of tradeoffs to                gain insight into the mechanisms of evolutionary change at the                  molecular and phenotypic levels.  Results should have broad                     implications for a number of problems in applied biology                        including plant and animal breeding, pest and disease organisms,                and the extinction process.",
