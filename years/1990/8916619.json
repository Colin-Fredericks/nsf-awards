 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among basic events of intracellular motility in eukaryotic cells                are directed movements of nuclei and organelles occurring in                    association with microtubules or microfilaments.  While                         unidirectional movements on microfilaments is mediated by the                   ATPase myosin, bidirectional movements on microtubules are                      mediated by two different motors.  The protein kinesin may                      function as an anterograde organelle translocator, while a                      protein similar to ciliary dynein may function as a retrograde                  translocator.  It is proposed to investigate the mechanism by                   which the pronuclei of marine eggs move along microtubules.                     These eggs are readily available, can be easily fertilized to                   initiate division, and are well suited for studies of retrograde                motility.  The female pronucleus moves exclusively in a                         retreograde direction along the microtubules assembled by the                   sperm aster, while other organelles move predominantly, but not                 exclusively, in this direction.  An in vitro translocation system               will be constructed to observe movements of pronuclei.  The                     retrograde translocator responsible for these movements will be                 localized and characterized, and other cytoplasmic factors                      necessary for retrograde movements will be identified.  Finally,                the regulation of motility and changes that occur before and                    after fertilization will be investigated.                                                                                                                       The results of these studies will increase our understanding of                 the mechanisms by which cellular organelles move, and, in                       particular, will characterize the the movement of the pronuclei                 of fertilized eggs.",
