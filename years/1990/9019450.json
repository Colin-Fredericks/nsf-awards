The program is entitled project FORCE (Focused                       Opportunities For Research Careers in Engineering).  FORCE involves             specially selected faculty research mentors from each of the                    engineering departments.  The four student participants                         will receive special advising, counseling and other support                     services designed to improve their retention in the program and                 enhance their potential for a successful research career.  They                 will have a mandatory internship experience in industry during the              summer prior to their matriculation as graduate students.                       Subsequent summer internships will be optional.",
