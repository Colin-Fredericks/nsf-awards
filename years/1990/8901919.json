 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introspective facilities of a programming language are those                facilities that support explicit access, modification, or control of            internal state components of the language processor (or runtime                 environment).  Examples of such internal state components are the               control stack, the environment, the current expression or instruction,          the heap, the I/O system, the interrupt systems, and the garbage                collector.  The development of languages based on reflective tower              architectures has demonstrated that machine-independent access and              modification of a language processor's current expression, environment,         and control stack can be provided in a unified, coherent, and                   semantically principled manner.                                                                                                                                      This research is concerned with extending the range of machine-            independent introspective facilities available to programming                   languages.  There are two facets of this extension.  One is to extend           introspective capabilities to additional language processor state               components, such as the store, I/O system, interrupt system, and                garbage collector.  The second facet is to investigate introspective            capabilities in the context of common programming language and                  programming environment features, such as concurrent processing,                encapsulation and privacy mechanisms, and compilation.",
