Efforts to encourage                    women, minorities and the handicapped to choose careers in                      engineering are needed.                                                                                                                                         This grant is to provide funds for a reception for women in                     chemical engineering to be held at the 1989 annual American                     Institute of Chemical Engineers meeting in San Francisco, CA.                   The purpose is to give women a chance to meet and discuss                       issues of common concern.  The reception is open to all who                     are attending the meeting.  A product of the meeting is a list                  of all female faculty members in the US, a list that is                         circulated and should help open lines of communication.",
