 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silicon aluminum oxynitride, commonly called SiAlON, is an                      industrial ceramic used in cutting tools, dies, chemical ware,                  containers for molten metals, bearings, gun barrels and a                       variety of engine components such as gas turbines, diesels,                     etc.   It has high toughness, high strength, reasonable                         hardness and good oxidation resistance and thermal shock                        resistance.  It is produced through the insitu reaction of its                  constituents Si3N4, AlN and Al203, plus sintering aids.  The                    solid state reaction can take up to hours to produce a solid                    block of SiAlON which is then ground into powder.  The                          properties and reliability of the SiAlON are affected by the                    starting materials, their particle size and purity as well as                   processing temperature and time.                                                                                                                                The purpose of this Small Business Innovation  Phase I it to                    produce a high purity and closely controlled particle size                      SiAlON powder to be used in the production of high strength                     components, eliminating the need for the insitu reaction                        process.  The PIs plan to develop an inductively coupled                        plasma synthesis process for the direct production of a high                    purity SiALON powder.  Screening reactions will be performed                    to select the optimum plasma frequency and precursor to                         product SiALON powder.  The synthesis process will be                           optimized with the produce SiAlON powder consolidated for                       property valuation and comparison to insitu produced SiAlON.                    A model will be developed for the synthesis reaction to                         directly produce SiAlON powder.",
