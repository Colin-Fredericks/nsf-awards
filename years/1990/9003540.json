 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Schatz is undertaking a one-year investigation to                     understand and outline the design of a computer system to                       support an electronic scientific community.  While later                        proposals will be submitted to support the system, this                         project is to lay the necessary groundwork to enable the                        implementation to proceed as planned.  When implemented, this                   system should be a new form of biological instrumentation                       which can effectively manipulate scientific databases.                          Appropriate community knowledge will be identified to be                        collected into a digital library and the design will                            incorporate the systems technology necessary to manipulate                      this library over nationwide networks.  The community chosen                    is the group of scientists studying the nematode worm                           Caenorhabditis elegans, a major model organism in molecular                     biology.  The \"worm community\" consists of some 500 members                     worldwide, with an unusual degree of open communication and                     sharing of unpublished information.  The community knowledge                    includes formal data, such as published literature and                          experimental results, and informal data, such as newsletters                    and experimental methods.  The designed system will capture                     a significant portion of this knowledge in electronic form and                  encode it into a \"worm information space\" which can be                          transparently browsed by scientists anywhere on nationwide                      scientific networks.  Preparation of the system design                          requires understanding user needs and available technology.                     this will be accomplished by working with researchers who will                  be the system's initial users and who are experts on the                        available data and technology.  Such investigation should                       enable the design to ensure that the system will contribute                     to making valuable scientific discoveries.",
