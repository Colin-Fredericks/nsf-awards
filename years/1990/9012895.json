Matthews of the University of California, Davis to conduct                   collaborative research for eight months with Dr. Kenji Omasa of                 the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba,                    Japan.  They will investigate the physiological mechanisms by                   which water deficits inhibit photosynthesis and by which photosynth-            eitic acclimation to dry conditions occurs.                                                                                                                     At low water status, stomatal closure and inhibition of chloroplast             function reduce photosynthesis.  Although significant nonstomatal               limitation to photosynthesis at low water status is widely                      accepted, most studies to date have assumed that rates of                       photosynthesis and transpiration are homogeneous over the                       experimental leaf area.  This project will use state-of-the art                 instrumentations for localized measurements of leaf physiology to               take into account the heterogeneity in stomatal closure that may                occur at low leaf water status.  This will allow a more rigorous                assessment of the relative importance of stomatal and nonstomatal               limitation to photosynthesis under dry conditions.",
