 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, genetic evidence has revealed that extra-                 pair mating is more widespread in apparently monogamous bird                    species than previously thought.  The costs and benefits of                     extra-pair mating are poorly understood for males and females                   because of a paucity of data and because, until recently, the                   genetic techniques available were inadequate for determining                    paternity in natural populations.  In this study, parentage of                  young in nests of western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) pairs in                   central coastal California will be determined, and behavioral,                  demographic and genetic data will be used to address the                        functional consequences of extra-pair mating.  Parentage of young               in nests where more than one male cares for young will be                       determined, as well as whether supernumerary males are                          nonbreeding helpers or actually father offspring in the nests at                which they feed.   This study will clarify the mating system of                 the western bluebired and will help to shed light on the extent                 and success of extra-pair mating as a reproductive alternative to               strict monogamy.",
