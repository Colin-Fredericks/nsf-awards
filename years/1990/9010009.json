 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clearing of Caroline Piedmont hardwood forests following                   European settlement reduced or eliminated populations of many                   plant and animal species farmland abandonment and secondary                     succession to pine and then hardwood forests in the first half of               this century afforded some species a partial recovery. In the                   second half of this century, urbanization is again fragmenting                  Piedmont forests with renewed threat to forest interior species.                The secondary fragmentation of Carolina Piedmont forests offers a               timely opportunity to study population and community responses                  and develop predictive models for both theoretical and practical                use.                                                                            The purpose of this planning research is to develop the ability                 to predict likely changes in population status and community                    composition for selected forest taxa as functions of measures of                environmental pattern reflecting forest fragmentation.  The                     geographic region of interest is the Carolina Piedmont,                         particularly Durham and Orange Counties and adjacent sections of                neighboring counties, which contain the largest protected                       sections of Piedmont forest as well as the most rapidly                         urbanizing areas.  Taxa selected for study will likely include                  forest birds and vascular plant communities.  Measures used to                  describe forest fragmentation may include total and core areas in               several forest types; distribution of forest fragment patch                     sizes; amount of edge between forest types and other land uses;                 distances among patches; lengths, widths and habitat                            characteristics of riparian and other corridors connecting forest               patches; and ages of patches, measured since lost major                         disturbance.  This planning activity will provide the information               necessary for development of a more complete study of forest                    fragmentation and landscape ecology.",
