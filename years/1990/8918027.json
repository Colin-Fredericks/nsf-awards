 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually every animal and plant species exhibits genetic                  variation for a variety of enzymes involved in the control of                   metabolism.  Although a few cases have been studied in detail, we               have a very poor understanding of the biological significance of                this variation.  Over the past two years, studies on a variety of               plant and animal species have demonstrated that the level of                    individual genetic variation, estimated for a series of enzyme                  synthesizing loci, is positively correlated with energy balance.                The higher the level of individual genetic variation (i.e.,                     heterozygosity), the lower the cost of metabolism, measured as                  heat production or mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption.                   The proposed research will attempt to establish a causal link                   between genetic variation of metabolic enzymes and this                         phenotypic variation in energy balance.  The key to this problem                seems to lie in how genotype influences the rate of enzyme                      synthesis and degradation and the energy cost associated with                   each.  The proposed research will use enzyme specific antibodies                and a variety of radioisotopes to estimate the metabolic costs                  of synthesis and degradation for a series of specific enzymes and               how these costs are mitigated by genotype at the enzyme                         synthesizing loci.  The results will be of significance in a                    variety of areas ranging from evolutionary biology to animal and                plant breeding.",
