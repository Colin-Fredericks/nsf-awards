 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will partially, support a FASEB Summer Research                      Conference on Cellular and Molecular Genetics to be held at Copper              Mountain, Colorado from August 12-17, 1990.  The major goal of this             conference is to bring together an eminent group of cellular                    biologists, molecular biologists, neurobiologists, biochemists and              geneticists to discuss multidisciplinary approaches to topics which             are at the forefront of contemporary biology.  The Conference is                deliberately meant to encompass broader areas so that participants              in diverse fields, but with common scientific goals, have an                    opportunity to interact.  There are nine sessions spread over five              days.  There will be a session in the morning and evening and the               afternoons would be used either to discuss new technologies or for              poster presentations.  The topics deal with: DNA replication,                   developmental biology of lower and higher eukaryotes, systems which             allow understanding of cellular differentiation, regulation of                  transcription, oncogenesis, RNA processing, the cell cycle                      regulation, molecular neurobiology and human genetics.                          Additionally, there will be sessions dealing with techniques to                 generate transgenic mice, homologous recombination and physical                 manipulation of large genomes.  In each scheduled session, the                  chairperson has carefully selected three or four principal speakers             to introduce the general subject.  The applicants are to include                an abstract along with the application.  The number of participants             is not to exceed 150.  There is extensive opportunity for                       discussion which will facilitate communication to promote                       scientific cooperation and collaboration among the participants.***              //",
