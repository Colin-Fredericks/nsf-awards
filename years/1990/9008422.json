The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a 18 month visit by Dr. Margaret                        Gradie of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst to the                        United Kingdom, to work with Professor Roy M. Anderson at the                   Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in                         London on \"Mathematical Modeling of Pair Formation and                          Fertility in an HIV Infected Population.\"  The AIDS epidemic                    adds a new dimension to human population biology as the                         behaviors inherent in mate selection and reproduction are                       precisely the conditions for transmission of the virus                          causing AIDS.  This research will explore how mating structure                  and fertility relate in an HIV infected population by use of                    a mathematical model and computer simulation, and will ask:                     (1) What mating behaviors maximize fertility while minimizing                   risk of infection?; and (2) How will mortality associated                       with AIDS affect the ability of individuals to meet culturally                  defined mating preferences?  The model will define a pairing                    function dependent on the mating referent, which will be                        defined as a probability distribution of pairing between                        individuals dependent on their membership in categories                         defined by the mating structure.  The variables which establish                 the mating structure reflect the risk structure of infection                    and include age, residence, infected or susceptible status, and                 sexual activity class.  The populations of males and females                    can be represented as vectors, subdivided by the structure                      variables.  The contents of the matrix are defined by the                       rates of pair formation between subdivisions.  Since these                      values are products, the system is non-linear, and standard                     iterative procedures cannot be used.  Quasi-Newton methods                      will be used to look for solutions, and steepest descent                        techniques to look for values which maximize fertility while                    minimizing risk of infection.  A series of computer simulations                 will vary the values assigned to the probability distributions                  defining mating referents, and vary assumptions on transmission                 rates, fertility, sexual activity, and morality due to AIDS.                                                                                                    The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
