 "awd_abstract_narration": "The heat shock or cellular stress response is a highly                     conserved cellular response to a variety of potentially lethal                  physical, chemical, and biological agents.  The broad longterm                  objectives of this research program are to determine the                        functions of members of stress protein families that have roles                 in the normal cellular physiology of vertebrates.  The project                  focuses on the 73 kilodalton mammalian heat shock cognate                       protein, hsc73, that can disassemble clathrin cages in vitro and                that promotes tranlocation of several proteins across endoplasmic               reticulum and mitochondrial membranes.  Models for the mechnism                 by which hsp70 family members may repair damaged structures such                as nucleoli, solubilize aggregates of denatured proteins, or                    promote translocation of other mproteins across membranes                       frequently invoke conformational changes.  However, no direct                   evidence of protein conformational changes has been obtained, nor               has the protein binding site(s) on any hsp70 family member been                 characterized, nor are the features of the interactive proteins                 involved in bninding to hsp70 family members known.  The                        experiments proposed will directly address the first two gaps in                our understanding of this protein family and will forge the way                 to filling the third gap.  Two novel reagents that have not been                applied previously to studies of this protein family are featured               in this application, a small well-characterized protein                         apocytochrome c that binds hsc73, and a vector construct capable                of expressing functional rat hsc73 in E. coli.  Biophysical                     studies of the hsp70 proteins are almost nonexistent, and so                    another goal is to obtain additional spectra using circular                     dichroism as part of a search for evidence of conformational                    changes and provide basic physical data on hsc73 such as                        exteinction coefficient and per cent helical content.  Inducible                eucaryotic expression vectors have been constructed to produce                  hsc73 antisense transcripts and to overproduce hsc73.  Mammalian                trnsformants have been developed and studies are planned to                     identify and anlyze phenotypes associated with cellular                         deficiencies in and overproduction of hsc73.                                                                                                                    This is a multidisciplinary approach to the question of the                     function of heat shock response proteins.  The heat shock                       response, or stress response, is a ubiquitous response of                       eukaryotic cells to a broad variety of stresses.  Although there                has been a great deal of knowledge developed in terms of                        cataloguing the proteins which are either induced or up-regulated               in response to stress, the functions of these proteins remain                   unknown.",
