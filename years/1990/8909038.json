 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative research project will be conducted by the                  University of Washington, Yale University, and Oregon State                     University for an experimental study of ecosystem responses to                  tree-fall gaps and spatial and temporal relationship between                    above- and belowground gaps.  It is hypothesized that mechanisms                of community and ecosystem responses to gaps can only be                        understood if both above- and belowground structures and                        resources are considered.  An experiment to determine the size of               aboveground gap needed to form a belowground gap in mature and                  old-growth coniferous forests will be imposed.  The investigators               will also measure how above-and belowground structural changes                  are reflected in resource availability and loss and in vegetative               response.  To examine the hypotheses, the team will create tree-                fall gaps of ranging from small to large in five sizes (0, 2, 8                 and 16 and 32 trees removed) in reach of two stand developmental                stages: mature (understory reinitiation), and old growth.  Above                and belowground sampling will be conducted to provide an estimate               of the mean of the gap and will consist of root biomass                         (separated into tree, shrub and herb components), N leaching                    below the rooting zone, and soil temperature and moisture, light                level determinations, shrub and herb biomass, seed germination                  and monitoring of advanced regeneration.  In the old-growth                     stands, above-and belowground resources (plus net N                             mineralization) and vegetative biomass will be sampled more                     intensively to provide not only an estimate of the gap mean but                 of the within-gap spatial patterns.  In addition, trenching                     experiments will be established in the old-growth stands to test                the relative importance of above- and belowground resources on                  tree establishment and growth and develop predictive models of                  plant response to resources.                                                         The three-institution project team is excellent.  Research                 sites and facilities are first rate.  Results should be important               to both the fundamental understanding of forest ecology and to                  forest resource management.",
