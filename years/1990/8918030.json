 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental study is designed to test several                        assumptions and predictions of genetic models used to explain the               coevolution of plant resistance to pathogens and pathogen                       virulence on hosts.  These models indicate that stabilizing                     selection can maintain genetic variation in host-plant resistance               and pathogen virulence when these traits are each accompanied by                pleiotropic fitness costs.  Unfortunately, little evidence is                   available about the costs to plants of pathogen-resistance; nor                 is there conclusive evidence that virulence is costly to                        pathogens.  Moreover, genetic modifier theory suggests that many                such traits may not be costly.                                                  The experiments have two main objectives: (1) determine the                     genetic mechanisms underlying virulence in the fungal pathogen                  Colletorichum dematium and resistance in its host, the tall                     morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, and (2) observe patterns of                    selection on virulence and resistance traits in these species.                  Results from these experiments will test three important                        assumptions of plant-pathogen coevolutionary theory: (1)                        Pathogens impose selection on their host plants, (2) Stabilizing                selection maintains genetic variation for both resistance and                   virulence characters, (3) Resistance to pathogens is costly.                    Findings will contribute directly to ecological theory and will                 add substantially to basic knowledge which can be used for                      problems in the applied ecology of disease management.                                                                                                           //",
