 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase state-of-the-art                       instrumentation to permit advanced research to be carried out on high-          frequency, coherent free-space and fiber sensors for a range of ultra-          sensitive applications.  In particular, instrumentation is being                requested to provide accurate DC to microwave frequency generation and          analysis capability.  This instrumentation will replace antiquated              instrumentation currently in use in experiments using homodyne and              heterodyne sensors in the following applications:  1) photothermal              spectroscopy and related photothermal studies;  2) studies of lateral           turbulence correlations in the atmosphere;  3) studies of local,                short-path turbulence;  4) detection of trace organic molecules in the          atmosphere;  5) studies of the ultrasonic properties of liquids up to           2GHz;  6) studies of the non-linear magnetooptical properties of                materials;  7) development of new heterodyne fiber sensors with novel           polarization and demodulation techniques using balance mixers.  These           sensors are being developed for local probing of electrooptic and               magnetooptic activity.                                                                                                                                          The specific equipment being requested comprises:  HP:  Model 8662A             Signal Gen.:  Model 8644 Signal Gen.:  Model 8562 Spectrum Analyzer:            Model 3162 Dynamic Signal Analyzer.",
