 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) wishes to investigate                     the possibility of adding the Soviet Union to the list of                       foreign countries in which data on science and engineering                      are collected so as to be comparable to U.S. data compiled by                   the NSF and published in Science and Engineering Indicators.                    One of the key areas of interest is survey data of public                       attitudes toward science and engineering.  In order to                          explore the possibility of undertaking cooperative work with                    the U.S.S.R. in this area, it is necessary to identify and                      make contact with appropriate researchers in the U.S.S.R., to                   establish their willingness to perform a national opinion                       survey in that country in coordination with a future Science                    and Engineering Indicators survey to be performed in the                        United States, and to obtain the necessary resources.                           Professor Linda Lubrano of American University is an expert                     on Soviet social science research and on the general state of                   the organization and management of science and engineering in                   the U.S.S.R.  Through her extensive contacts in the Soviet                      scientific community she will initiate exploratory contacts                     on behalf of the NSF in this area.  It is envisioned that                       subsequent cooperative work would take place under the                          auspices of the NSF-U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences Memorandum                     of Understanding in the Field of Basic Scientific Research.",
