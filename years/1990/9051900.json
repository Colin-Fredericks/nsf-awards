 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Oregon             State University to help purchase equipment to upgrade the                      laboratory with microcomputers and sophisticated software so that               students can experience the same level of technology that is now                commonly used in psychological research.  Specifically, the new                 microcomputer laboratory will include 18 IBM compatible PC's, five              dot-matrix printers, an IBM compatible 386 microcomputer connected              to a Sytek network, and Micro Experimental Laboratory (MEL)                     software.  With this setup, students will experience all aspects                of psychological research.  They will use the Sytek network to                  access the computerized library retrieval service for references.               Instructors, teaching assistants and advanced students will use the             386 computer with MEL software to select and design experiments to              be conducted.  Stimuli specified by the experimental design will                be presented to the students at their PC's who will make                        appropriate responses on the keyboard.  These responses will be                 recorded and transferred to the larger 386 computer or to the                   university mainframe computer via the Sytek network for a                       professional-level statistical analysis.  Finally, the results will             be presented on a monitor or printer for student interpretation.                The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
