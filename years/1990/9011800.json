 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research constitutes the first phase of a project to test theories         of policy making and of mass media effects on the foreign policy                process which predicts changes in policy officials' national security           paradigm due to mass media coverage.  The research tests the hypothesis         that media coverage of global environmental change has initiated an             institutional adaptive response in the form of an expansion of the              official paradigm of national security to include environmental                 threats.                                                                                                                                                        In this phase of the research the investigators will conduct in-depth           interviews using both structured open and closed-ended questions to             determine the depth and conditions of the relationship between media            and policy makers paradigm formation, especially between environmental          reporting and national security paradigm formation.  Of particular              interest will be questions relating to which media are most effective           in influencing environmental and national security questions, what              kinds of issues and under what conditions do media impact policy maker          perceptions, the relationship between media impact and other factors            such as agency, rank, sex, issue and functional area of responsibility,         and appointed versus elected policy makers.  This research should               provide valuable insights about the use to which policy makers make of          media inputs on global environmental change.",
