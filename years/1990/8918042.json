 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Archie will examine patterns of evolution of DNA                       sequences in a broad array of organisms.  Through the use of                    information in DNA sequence databases, the emphasis of the                      research will be on the evaluation of levels of accumulated                     random substitutions within DNA sequences and an examination of                 how these substitutions affect our ability to analyze sequence                  data.  It has been generally acknowledged that DNA  sequences                   contain a large amount of information on the evolutionary history               of living organisms that can be used to make inferences about                   relationships among species.  However, it is recognized that                    these sequences contain a large amount of random information                    because of the nature of the origin of change at sites in the                   sequences and because each site can take only four different                    forms. In previous research, biologists have assumed that there                 is substantial residual information in the sequences, a by-                     product of the evolutionary history of the organisms, that could                be decoded using modern methods of analysis through the                         incorporation of computers.  However, the methods for the                       analysis of these data break down and produce less certain                      results as the level of randomness increases.  Levels of                        randomness are expected to vary between different regions of the                DNA within the nucleus as well as in nucleotide sequences outside               of the nucleus and are expected to increase as the amount of time               since divergence between the species being analyzed increases.                  Since many species and species groups being compared have                       diverged over millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of                   millions of years, in many comparisons of sequences biologists                  expect substantial amounts of random information about the                      evolutionary history to be present in the sequence data.                             The research program will analyze levels of random sequence                information for a variety of different groups of organisms and                  for different areas in the genome.  It will rely on sequence                    information that is present in DNA and protein sequence databases               for information.  These databases are growing rapidly in size                   because of recent technological advances in molecular biology.                  The sensitivity of a variety of numerical techniques for                        analyzing sequence data due to the accumulation of random                       information will be examined.  Several new analytical techniques                have been developed over the last 2-3 years and have generated a                substantial amount of interest.  However, neither these nor the                 older techniques have been examined from the perspective to be                  used in this research.  The results from the study will help to                 indicate which sequences and parts of sequences will be useful                  for inferring relationships among species and species groups by                 identifying regions of the genome that tend to accumulate                       evolutionary useful and random changes at different rates.  The                 results will also help indicate the lengths of sequences that                   must be examined in order to make reasonable inferences about                   evolutionary relationships.",
