 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study construction of                      constant scalar curvature Kaehler manifolds of complex dimension                2 by two different methods.  The first of these involves a                      generalized Gibbon-Hawking ansatz, while the second uses the                    Banach space inverse function theorem applied to Kaehler                        potentials with point singularities of conormal type.  He will                  also study global deformations of complete non-compact Riemannian               manifolds with quaternionic holonomy.  Lastly, he will                          investigate the  global structure of the universal curve for                    Riemann surfaces with spin structure.                                                In this project, the principal investigator will analyze                   complex manifolds which relate to twistor and string theory.                    These mathematical theories have been used to explain some of the               behavior of subatomic particles.  Manifolds are mathematical                    objects which include regular curves and surfaces as examples.                  Both of these examples are based on multiple copies of the real                 numbers.  In this study, manifolds which are based on copies of                 the complex numbers, instead of the real numbers, will be used to               analyze several questions arising from physics.",
