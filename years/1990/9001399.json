 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award extends for one year the American Statistical                   Association project entitled \"On- Site Research Program to Improve the          Quality of Labor Statistics\".  The plan for subsequent years is to              effect a merger with similar on- site research programs conducted at            the Bureau of Census and the National Center for Education Statistics.                                                                                          The program,  which was initiated at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in          1987,  brings senior research fellows and associates to the Bureau for          periods of up to one year.  Its broadbased goal is to help bridge the           gap between academic scholars and governmental scientists by exposing           the fellows and associates to the methodological problems and policy            issues likely to be encountered only in a large scale Federal                   statistical agency and by exposing government social scientists to new          theoretical developments which might have application to their work.            Residence at the Bureau allows fellows and associates to carry out              research that would be difficult if not impossible to do without the            ready access to the data resources of the Bureau of Labor Statistics            which the program provides.",
