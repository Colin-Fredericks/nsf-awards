 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake sediments, by their ability to retain or release                      dissolved phosphorus, play a critical role in controlling p-                    lading to the water column.   In the ocean P release can be                     predicted relatively accurately simply from a knowledge of how                  much decomposition occurred.  Thus, in marine systems post-                     decompositional factors (sorption, mineral formation, microbial                 immobilization) are of minor importance in comparison to                        decomposition.  In freshwaters, on the other hand, these post-                  decompositional factors are of major importance making sediment P               release much more difficult to predict.  Despite decades of                     research on sediment P release in freshwaters, and lists of                     factors that might influence this release in the laboratory,                    there is essentially no knowledge as to which of these factors                  are actually important in natural systems; consequently there is                limited ability to predict P release.                                                                                                                           Cole, Caraco, and Likens propose to investigate the controls of P               release in both hard and soft-water lakes over a very broad                     geographic range.  They will use a straightforward, in situ,                    geochemical approach modified from oceanography, to investigate P               release both empirically across a large number and range of lake                types, and mechanistically in a of suite six lakes that differ                  dramatically in their P release responses.  Preliminary results                 suggest that: 1) Contrary to standard limnological dogma, oxic                  versus anoxic conditions explains very little of the enormous                   natural variation in sediment P release among systems; 2) this                  variation is best explained by the sulfur content of the system.                Cole, Caraco and Likens are very productive and innovative                      researchers who have provided a unique way to investigate                       nutrient fluxes.  The Institutional support for this research is                excellent.  The investigators propose a feasible mechanism to                   explain phosphorus fluxes in freshwater systems.  The tests                     proposed in this research should lead to important information                  that will impact water management policies.",
