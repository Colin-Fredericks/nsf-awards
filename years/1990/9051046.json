 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is the strengthening of the undergraduate               science students' experience in modern instrumentation.  The                    college has acquired the equipment necessary to expose students                 particularly to spectroscopy (spectrometer, sensitive balance and               computers and related software).  Spectroscopy has become the                   standard technique for determining the structure of products                    formed in a chemical reaction;  the students are using the                      equipment in organic chemistry classes.                                                                                                                         Through the equipment, the students have gained an opportunity to               combine the theories of spectroscopy with experimental                          experience, learning its diverse and powerful applications first                hand.  This project is particularly significant because it goes                 beyond simply modernizing a laboratory to increasing student                    awareness of growing critical issues in science such as pollution               generated by waste chemicals, and introducing them to a cost-                   effective means of dealing with such issues.  Further, the                      instrumentation is helping the college provide quality science                  education to a student body which consists predominantly of women               (66%), educationally and economically disadvantaged individuals                 (72%), and members of ethnic minorities (80%).  This is not only                enhancing their science education, but is also helping to                       stimulate and motivate these students towards further                           participation in the scientific arena.                                                                                                                          The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
