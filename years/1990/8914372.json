 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate continued collaboration between                      physicists at Kansas State University and Argonne National                      Laboratory in the U.S. and the University of Electro-                           Communications, the University of Tsukuba, and Kyoto University                 in Japan.  The scientists are cooperating in a study of what are                known as electron correlation effects in heavy particle collisions              and in collisions of atoms with antimatter.  These effects arise                when the processes being observed depend on the interaction                     between two or more electrons.  Such interaction or                             interdependency in general requires a much more complicated and                 difficult treatment than when one-electron processes are                        considered.  Examples of two-electron processes are double                      capture, transfer excitation, transfer ionization, double                       ionization, and double excitation.  These phenomena are of                      current experimental interest, and they pose new challenges to                  theorists.  The principal investigators in this project under                   the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program are Dr. James H.                     McGuire, Kansas State University, and Dr. Michio Matsuzawa, The                 University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.                                                                                                             The collaborating researchers in this current activity will                     examine the impact excitation of doubly excited states and                      double ionization of helium atoms by protons and antiprotons                    over a wide range of collision energies.  They will also study                  some aspects of Coulombic three-body systems by analyzing the                   wave functions in the body-frame of the system, using mass-                     weighted hyperspherical coordinates.  The U.S. and Japanese                     groups have been investigating similar topics and have                          collaborated previously.  Exchanging and combining methods and                  computer codes should prove beneficial to each group involved,                  and to the understanding of the physical processes being studied.",
