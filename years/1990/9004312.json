 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to discover the details of                 the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism.  A series of                  measurements of oxidation rates for several different sulfide                   minerals, show different reaction orders for different minerals                 as well as two distinct ranges of activation energies.  These                   differences are presumably caused by differences in the overall                 reaction mechanism. The P.I. have used thermodynamic and kinetic                information on individual aqueous sulfur species and elementary                 reactions taken from the literature to  construct a general model               of the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism.  They                      propose to refine this model using experimental data, gathered                  as part of this research, on the effects of various catalysts and               inhibitors (chemical probes of the mechanism) on the rate of the                overall reaction and on the distribution of sulfur species in the               reacted solution.  These data will eventually be woven into a                   quantitative numerical model that should prove useful in a wide                 range of scientific and  technological endeavors.",
