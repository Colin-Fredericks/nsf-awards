 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award adds an experimental component to ongoing research on                exploiting type systems as a basis for interfacing dissimilar                   programming languages.  The experimentation will apply                          fundamental computer science insights to support software for                   parallel numeric supercomputing.  Three specific new efforts are                included:                                                                                                                                                                1.  Adaption of polymorphic type checking and inference,                            as found in Standard ML, to  deal with vectors,                                 arrays and various numeric data types as in Fortran                             77;                                                                                                                                                         2.  Evaluation of \"mixin\" based inheritance as a                                    framework for structuring C-based numeric libraries                             into more modern and secure C++ clauses and                                                                                                                 3.  Exploitaion of declarative language concepts as a                               high level \"harness\" for parallelizing large blocks                             of existing imperative code.                                                                                                                       This work will be performed while the Principal Investigator is                 on sabbatical leave at Cornell University.  this opportunity will               take advantage of several unique resources: (i) collaboration                   with research groups in constructive type theory, language design               for physical and mathematical scientists, and applications of                   dataflow programming; (ii) interaction with the staff and users                 of the Cornell Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and                  Engineering, and (iii) development of prototype software on                     Cornell's 48-node BBN Butterfly multiprocessor.",
