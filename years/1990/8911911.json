 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Physical Chemistry Program the                          Principal Investigator will undertake a comprehensive                           theoretical study of main group organometallic chemistry, with                  an emphasis on silicon and the other elements in its group in                   the periodic table. A thorough understanding of the electronic                  structures and chemical bonding of these elements is of both                    fundamental and practical importance. These elements constitute                 the backbones of industrially important polymers, such as the                   silicones, and are the basic substrates of electronic chips.                                                                                                    State-of-the-art electronic structure theory, interfaced with                   quantum and semi-classical dynamics studies for the prediction                  of reaction dynamics and mechanisms, will be used. Areas to be                  investigated include analysis of fundamental reaction                           mechanisms, such as the hydrosilation, coupling and                             rearrangement reactions. Other reaction types to be considered                  include those between silicon-containing compounds and atomic                   and molecular oxygen, reactions of importance in chemical vapor                 deposition, SN2 reactions at silicon centers, and the role of                   pseudorotation in the pentacoordinated reactive intermediates,                  unimolecular decompositions of silanes, reactions of divalent                   group IV species, and reactions of small cations and anions.                    The molecular and electronic structures, properties and                         reactivity of highly strained rings will be investigated also,                  as will the nature of a variety of unusual bonding                              arrangements. Initial investigations of structure and                           reactivity will be undertaken for biologically active compounds                 which contain main group metals and small clusters of main                      group metals. Theoretical investigations will include the                       development of extended basis sets for fourth and fifth period                  elements, continued explorations of techniques for interfacing                  electronic structure and dynamics calculations, and the                         development of methods for interfacing ab initio and semi-                      empirical calculations.",
