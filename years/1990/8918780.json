 "awd_abstract_narration": "The local structure of complex problems is being studied.  It has been          shown that certain NP-complete problems satisfy a linear difference             equation that is similar to the wave equation of mathematical                   physics; some immediate consequences of this have already been                  deduced.  It has been proved that local search algorithms starting              from an arbitrary poor configuration, under certain conditions,                 converge to the average cost of the system in O(n) iterations.  The             solution of the equation and its application to the analysis and                design of local search algorithms like simulated annealing and                  Kernighan-Lin search are being studied.  Extensions of these                    techniques to interior point methods are being developed.  A                    hypothesis has been proposed regarding these neighborhood structures            for which local search algorithms will generally be most successful.            Several tests are being conducted to verify this hypothesis.  These             include a new local search algorithm for the traveling salesman                 problem that, unlike existing algorithms of the same neighborhood size,         is expected to be successful even when the triangle inequality is not           satisfied and/or the distances between cities are asymmetric.",
