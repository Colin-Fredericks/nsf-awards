As usual, participation will be limited to 150 scientists                       (including speakers and moderators), selected on the basis of                   their expertise and interest in this area and their expected                    contribution to the success of this program.  It will be the                    first meeting entirely devoted to Protein Phosphatases: their                   structure, function, regulation at the protein and genetic level                and role in the control of cellular processes as they occur in                  health and disease.  The Conference will consist of nine                        sessions, each with four speakers and a discussion leader;                      selected among investigators who have made seminal contributions                to this field.  In addition, poster sessions will be held that                  will provide an opportunity for more junior participants to                     present their data and discuss them with authorities in the                     field.  This meeting will bring to light the sum of evidence now                indicating the crucial role Protein Phosphatases are playing in                 such physiological processes as cell cycle, growth,                             differentiation and transformation.",
