This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics of the University of                  Illinois, Urbana.  The investigators and the projects titles                    follow: Robert Craggs, Visual Study of 2-Complexes in 3- and 4-                 Manifolds; Wolfgang Haken, Algorithmic Topology of 3-Manifolds;                 Ward Henson, Exponentiation; Derek Robinson, Group Theory;                      and Douglas West, Existence and Extremal Problems in Graph Theory               and Partially Ordered Sets.",
