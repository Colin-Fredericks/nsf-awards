This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics of Brandeis University:               Green's conjecture on the free resolution of canonical curves,                  the investigator is David Eisenbud; equivariant free resolutions                and equivariant Groebner bases, the investigators are David                     Buchsbaum and Eisenbud; development of \"Macaulay\", the                          investigator is Eisenbud; hypergeometric series identities and                  generalized symmetric functions, the investigator is Ira Gessel;                completely integrable systems, the investigators are Mark Adler                 and Pierre Van Moerbeke.",
