 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Miocene strata in South America contain rich deposits of            fossil vertebrates in places, including an important record of                  monkey evolution in the New World.  Dr. Richard Kay proposes to                 expand his successful research on the Miocene vertebrates of                    Chile through field work in Colombia and Argentina.  The proposed               research in Colombia will provide important new information                     concerning the tropical forest fauna of South America during the                Miocene.  His research team will include several U.S. scientists                specializing on geochronology of the regions and non.primate                    fossils, as well as several in.country collaborators.                                   The proposed inter.disciplinary international research                  project will have wide implications.  Several South American                    nationals will gain experience in the latest approaches to                      magneto.stratigraphy and isotopic age dating.  New fossil                       discoveries may shed light on the evolutionary history of New                   World vertebrate lineages.  These fossils will provide the best                 view to date of the South American fauna prior to the interchange               between North and South America approximately 3 millino years                   ago, following the rise of the Panamanian Isthmus.  Results from                this project will be of interest to mammalogists,                               anthropologists, geologists with many interests, biogeographers,                and evolutionary biologists.",
