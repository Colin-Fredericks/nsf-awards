 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Gross and King will conduct research in the areas               of harmonic analysis and geometrical quantum field theory.                      Professor Gross' research will be in the flourishing field of                   logarithmic Sobolev inequalities which he will attempt to prove                 in various untried circumstances including some infinite                        dimensional situations.  Professor King's research will involve                 quantum field theory and its relation to geometry and topology.                 In particular he will use ideas of quantum field theory to                      investigate the theory of knots, links, and braids in Euclidean                 three space.                                                                         Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities have been useful in many                  areas of mathematics ranging from the theory of smooth surfaces                 and how they vibrate to how fast systems of various kinds reach                 equilibrium.  The theory of knots, an area within the branch of                 mathematics called topology, was recently shown to be connected                 to other formalisms in physics and mathematics, in particular the               theory of quantum fields.",
