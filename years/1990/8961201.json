 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrically conducting polymers may be synthesized using                       photochemical rather than chemical electrochemical means.  A                    new process involves illumination of an aqueous solution                        containing pyrrole and a electron acceptor with ultraviolet                     light.  Absorption of the light induces electron transfer from                  the pyrrole to the electron acceptor, thereby promoting                         polymerization of the oxidized pyrrole monomer.  The resultant                  polymer is a highly conducting film which adheres strongly to                   the substrate.                                                                                                                                                  The process is fast and simple and lends itself to the                          deposition of conducting polymer films onto non-conducting                      substrates.  It may be useful in the manufacture of                             electrochromic displays, rechargeable batteries,                                electrochemical sensors, and electromagnetic shielding.                         Photopolymerization may have an advantage over current methods                  of conducting polymer synthesis in being more suitable for                      industrial-scale manufacture.                                                                                                                                   The research will investigate synthesis by photopolymerization                  and characterize the properties of photo-deposited conducting                   polymers with respect to their conductivity, adherence to the                   substrate, and their stability.",
