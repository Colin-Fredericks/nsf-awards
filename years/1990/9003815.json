 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle objectives of this research are to learn new computer           skills, conduct analyses of 765 cases of men's and women's aggressive           behavior in an Australian Aboriginal community, and to integrate the            results of these quantitative analyses with material on the                     sociocultural context in which these cases occur in a book titled:              \"Fighting Sticks and Spears:  Women and Aggression -- An                        Exploration.\" The publication will contribute to an understanding of            how and why women everywhere or anywhere, act aggressively.  Detailed           illustrations will be presented of acts of female aggression and                victimization and their sociocultural context.  It will also                    integrate the Aboriginal data with those of other studies in order to           address a number of current issues about female aggression including            gender/sex differences in aggression, female competition, and women's           roles in family violence.  Finally, it will analyze the impact of               Western theories and stereotyped on the study of female aggression              and victimization and suggest appropriate modifications of current              theory.                                                                           Interactive activities will include teaching a graduate seminar on            women and aggression as well as a team.taught undergraduate course on           Australian Aboriginal Ethnography.                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and                        engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.          By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a                   valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
