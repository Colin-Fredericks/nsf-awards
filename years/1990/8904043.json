 "awd_abstract_narration": "The value of foliage as a food for herbivorous insect larvae               depends upon the nutritive value of the plant tissue and the food               processing capabilities of the insect years it has become                       increasingly clear that the characteristics that are most                       important in determining nutritive value of foliage are nitrogen,               water, and toxin content, and possible also acidity.  Much less                 is known about the factors that determine an insect's capability                to process ingested materials to counter the characteristics of                 foliage that are potentially harmful.  In very few cases have                   convincing mechanistic explanations been provided to explain why                one insect species can grow will on a particular plant while                    another grows very poorly.  It is the purpose of this research to               assess the importance of various foliage characteristics that                   prevent effective food utilization by lepidopteran larvae, to                   identify biochemical characteristics of the insects that allow                  them to overcome these barriers, and to assess the metabolic                    costs of these adaptations.                                                          If this project achieves its objectives, the results and                   conclusions will be useful in explaining the relative                           susceptibilities of different types of plant species (both crop                 plants and wild plants) to different insect species (both pest                  species and non-pest species).  This work may also explain the                  ability of some insects to switch food plants or adapt to new                   hosts.  Thus, this research may help to clarify some of the                     biochemical factors that have fostered the evolution of diversity               among insects, and to explain why some insects become pests and                 others do not.",
