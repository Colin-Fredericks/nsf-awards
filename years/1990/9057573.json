 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on research in three areas: Query                          Optimization, Active Databases, and Learning mechanisms for                     relational database management systems. Query optimization is                   necessary to provide fast access to large databases; in this                    project, techniques that allow the optimization of multiple                     queries, thus providing higher throughput for the system are                    developed and implemented in a prototype system. In contrast to                 the traditional single command-at-a-time optimization, a                        multiple-query processing strategy avoids redundant page accesses               by accessing data common to more than one query, only once. The                 research on Active databases investigates methods that allow the                specification, efficient monitoring and processing of triggers in               relational systems. Such methods are essential in contemporary                  systems and allow the database management system to \"react\" to                  changes performed. The use of machine learning is explored at the               buffer management and query optimization levels in order to                     improve the performance of database systems. In particular,                     schemes that will adapt the above sub-systems based on the query                and user environment, are investigated.  The contributions of the               research in the above three areas lie in improving performance of               relational database systems in contemporary applications, such as               deductive and engineering databases.",
