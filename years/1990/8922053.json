 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extremely large cohort of the American population is moving             into post-retirement stages of the life cycle.  This growth in the              number of elderly people has received considerable attention as                 scholars have addressed their current and future social and economic            needs, but relatively little scientific study has been focused on the           form and location of housing that will accommodate them.  Of special            significance is the fact that a large segment of this group has                 occupied the same dwelling units for very long periods, raising                 families and going through \"empty-nester\" periods while household heads         were still employed.  The impacts of the transition of this group into          the different lifestyles and economic conditions of retirement are not          well understood, however.  Are elderly persons who continue to occupy           their long-term residences more likely to renew their temporal and              financial investments in housing, thereby improving the quality of              dwellings and neighborhoods, or will they become more lax in their              maintenance and improvement efforts, thereby contributing to relative           decline in the quality of housing?  This project will address this              question by examining data from the Annual Housing Survey,                      statistically seeking to determine (1) if a linear relationship exists          between the length of time that a household has occupied a dwelling and         housing quality, (2) the direct and indirect influences of length of            residence on housing quality when controlling for differences in the            characteristics of households and dwellings, (3) the magnitudes and             locations of elderly residents occupying poor-quality housing, and (4)          how patterns of housing for the elderly vary among different                    metropolitan areas.  In addition to identifying these relationships,            this project will adapt the LISREL VII model to analyze direct and              indirect causal linkages between demographic and housing factors.                    This project will provide valuable insights into the causes and            consequences of long-term occupation of residences by the elderly,              thereby enhancing basic scientific understandings of this important             topic.  The conclusions of this research also will be very useful to            analysts and decision makers in the private and public sectors as they          seek to determine what problems may intensify in future years as the            nation's elderly population continues to expand.",
