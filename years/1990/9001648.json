Previous work by                  Dr. Mix and his colleague Dr. Emeron from the University                        of Washington has found that concentrations of V and U in                       foram tests have varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided                        the assumption is true tht formas incorporated these metals                     in equilibrium with seawater, this preliminary data suggests                    that bottom, water during the last glacial period was                           more oxygenated that at present, and that between Atlantic                      and Pacific bottom water was substantially different from that                  of today. In this renewal award the PIs will to continue                        their research in several directins: 1) they will perform                       culturing experiments with collaborator Dr. Erez in Israel to                   determine the uptake patterns of V and U in live forams; 2) they                will improve solid source mass spectometry techniques for                       measuring V and U in single species of forams; and 3) they will                 apply these techniques to refine the history of anoxia in the                   world's oceans since the last interglacial",
