 "awd_abstract_narration": "In February, 1989, Sears, Roebuck and Company was found innocent                of the charge of sex discrimination in a lawsuit brought by the                 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  The two major                  expert witnesses, both respected historians of women, testified                 for the case.  Since one testified for Sears and the other for the              EEOC, their testimonies evoked very different visions of women's                motivations and women's roles in the work force.  In so doing, they             contributed to the way the attorneys defined the significant issues             of the case as well as the way the scholarly and legal communities              interpreted the meaning of the trial.                                                                                                                           The purpose of this project is to study in depth the Sears case in              order to examine how historical and scientific evidence is used by              the Court and to explore the conflicts between scholarly and legal              forms of reasoning.  The Sears case itself took EEOC twelve years               to prepare and cost 2.5 million dollars.  The trial took ten months             in court and resulted in a transcript of 20,000 pages.  In addition             to the case analysis, the legal, institutional, and theoretical                 issues that emerged from it will be explored.  The analysis will                include an assessment of the competing discourses of social                     science, statistics, the rhetoric of the court, and the scholar or              expert witness.  The trial record will be used to illuminate how                those involved dealt with contemporary events, how they used                    knowledge and historical evidence, and how they understood the                  corporate culture and the relationship of the law and the academy               to it.  The official record will be supplemented with interviews                of the participants.                                                                                                                                            The examination of the modes of legal discourse in the Sears case               brings a needed rigor to the study of theories of discrimination.               The project will contribute to our understanding of the factors                 which influence legal decisionmaking in affirmative action cases                and will expand knowledge of the legal theory of equality.  In                  addition, the project promises to make a major contribution to                  understanding of the role of expert witnesses and social science                evidence in the courtroom.  Finally, the research has important                 implications for shedding light on the relationship of law and the              academy to corporate culture.",
