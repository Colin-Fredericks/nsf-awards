 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous unsolved problems plague astrophysics as we approach the               end of the 20th century.  Two of them are the observation of                    fewer neutrinos coming from the sun than theory predicts and the                probable existence of more matter in the universe than revealed                 by the  visible stars and galaxies.  Both problems could be                     resolved if  there exist certain as of yet undetected elementary                particles  known as \"weakly interacting massive particles\"                      (WIMPs).                                                                                                                                                        The Principal Investigator was the originator of the  hypothesis                that WIMPS inhabit the cores of the sun and other stars, and that               they are significant contributors to the universe's \"missing\"                   mass. He proposes to continue his investigation of the effects of               WIMPs on the sun's structure, on the evolution of stars in                      general, and on the presence of dark matter in the universe.  It                should be added, that even if the WIMP hypothesis turns out to be               wrong, it has already stimulated -- and promises to continue to                 do so -- much new research in a variety of fields in physics.",
