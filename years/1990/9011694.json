 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been two main philosophical obstacles to                             investigations in set theory.  One is the opinion that there                    is no conception of the universe of sets that can lead to the                   solution of outstanding problems such as the continuum problem                  and the existence of large cardinals.  The other is the                         opinion that set theory is ineradicably 'Platonistic.'                          Platonism in mathematics, some argue, implies that set theory                   could be wrong, even though, from an internal point of view,                    there is nothing wrong with it.  They argue that it could be                    wrong because it implies the existence of things that just do                   not exist.  Both of these opinions, and especially both                         together, have led to a formalistic attitude toward set theory                  and, in particular, have encouraged the turn from the study                     of set theory to the study of models of first order axiomatic                   set theory.                                                                                                                                                     Professor Tait has two aims in this project.  First, he wants                   to argue that the conception of the universe of sets such as                    is contained in the 1930 paper by Zermelo  and further                          developed in Godel's \"What is Cantor's continuum problem\" is                    a coherent conception which supports the axioms of ZF as well                   as providing a foundation for investigations into the                           questions of the Continuum Hypothesis and the existence of                      large cardinals.  Second, he wants to examine the                               philosophical confusions underlying the idea of 'Platonism'                     in mathematics in light of recent literature on the subject.",
