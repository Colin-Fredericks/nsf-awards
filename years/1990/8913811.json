 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemical kinetic                       studies.  The efforts of two investigators, Drs. John Hemminger                 and Robert McIver, are combined to utilize a new approach                       previously developed involving laser induced thermal desorption                 of transient species during a chemical reaction, and their                      detection by Fourier transform mass spectrometry.  The key                      advantage of this method is the ability to detect multiple                      species simultaneously.  The method will be used to study the                   kinetics of transformation of hydrocarbon molecules coadsorbed                  with heteroatom containing molecules as a function of                           concentration and coverage at well characterized single crystal                 surfaces.                                                                       In particular, the studies using the laser induced thermal                      desorption-Fourier transform mass spectrometry method will                      focus on three projects.  The first involves the study of                       collective phenomena involving two coadsorbates on platinum                     \u0131111! as a function of coverage.  The second involves complex                   tranformations such as dehydrocyclization of simple alkanes and                 alkenes over catalytically relevent single crystal surfaces.                    The third project will focus on the effects of bismuth                          postdosing to block specific surface chemical sites on the                      adsorbate, thereby examining the influence of such blockage on                  transformation kinetics of ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt\u0131111!.",
