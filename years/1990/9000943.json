Five session topics, which concern                     important issues in modern developmental biology have been                      selected; they include molecular, cellular, and tissue                          development in both animals and plants. There will be two                       sessions on each topic, one in which 20 minute talks will be                    presented by junior faculty and one in which 10 minute talks will               be presented by 5-6 postdoctoral and graduate students. In                      addition to the platform sessions, there will be poster sessions                for both faculty and students. Three nationally recognized                      speakers will each give one hour keynote seminars.                              %%%                                                                             In the past advanced graduate student sand postdoctoral fellows                 have found this meeting to be a particularly valuable opportunity               to present their work in and informal atmosphere and to meet                    their peers and the faculty from nearby institutions.",
