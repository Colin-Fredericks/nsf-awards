 "awd_abstract_narration": "To improve the introductory laboratories, the Physics Department is             introducing microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) instruments into the           laboratory curriculum.  The equipment consists of eight                         microcomputers along with sensors and software that can be utilized             in all of the physics department's undergraduate laboratories.  The             sensors are interfaced to the microcomputers to measure physical                quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration, force,                     temperature, sound and light.  As measurements are taken, data                  obtained by the sensors are displayed in digital and graphical form             that can be later manipulated and analyzed giving students                      unprecedented power to explore, measure, and learn from the physical            world.  MBL instruments have been shown to make the understanding of            physical phenomena more accessible to the naive science learner, and            they expand the investigations that more advanced students can                  undertake.  The purchase and implementation of MBL instruments will             significantly benefit students because recent research in educational           and cognitive science verify the importance for students to have                solid empirical and heavily phenomenological experiences in                     developing their science skills and learning concepts.  The                     University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
