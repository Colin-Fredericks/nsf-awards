 "awd_abstract_narration": "Travel support is provided to outstanding undergraduate and                     graduate students to attend the meeting of the Society for                      Research on Biological Rhythms.  Biological rhythms regulate the                function of living systems at virtually every level of                          organization, from molecular to organismal in animals throughout                the Animal Kingdom.  In non-human animals, biological timing                    serves as a wake-up clock and organizer of daily routine.  While                the pacemaker is believed to be located in the suprachiasmatic                  nucleus of the hypothalamus, one event of this meeting is to                    debate the existence of other pacemakers.  In humans, sleep and                 wakefulness, cognitive and motor performance, body temperature,                 blood pressure, serum hormone levels, and urinary metabolism all                vary rhythmically.  Alternations in human ultradian, circadian                  and seasonal rhythms are important in a number of clinical                      conditions as well as in coping with jet-lag and shift-work                     activities.  This meeting reflects the broad coverage of rhythmic               phenomena in living systems by bringing together scientists with                expertise in a number of areas.  The span of research will range                from molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to                       neurobiology, neuroendocrinology, ecology and clinical human                    applications.  Symposia, workshops, slide presentations and                     posters will provide a means for extensive communication among                  the scientists and students.  The goals are to facilitate an                    exchange of scientific information which will lead to important                 insights and stimulate new ideas that could have a major impact                 on the area of biological rhythms.  Moreover, the scientific                    program is directed towards encouraging graduate and                            undergraduate student participation to help promote their                       training as prospective scientists in biological sciences.",
