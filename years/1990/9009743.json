 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of democracy has always been of major concern to political          science.  Political scientists have conducted research on what                  democracy means, how democratic systems are organized, the content and          effects of different kinds of democratic institutions, the social and           economic preconditions of democracy, and so forth.                                                                                                              In contemporary society the basic idea of democracy is triumphant               throughout the world (even though democratic ideals are frequently              violated in practice).  It remains the case, though, that democracy             means very different things to different people.  This is as true for           political philosophers as it is for political leaders and ordinary              citizens.                                                                                                                                                       In this project the investigator will ascertain and compare the variety         of meanings that political activists, political leaders, and ordinary           people ascribe to the idea of democracy.  This will be done through             intensive examination of the beliefs of selected individuals, chosen on         the basis of variety in their orientation toward politics.  A research          procedure called \"Q methodology\" will be used, in which individuals             are asked to react to a large number of statements relating to                  democracy.                                                                                                                                                      The results of this investigation will be used to do two things.                First, they will determine whether particular theories of democracy             (e.g., liberal democracy, participatory democracy) find support or              rejection in the way people feel.  Second, they will be used to specify         the variety of ways in which individuals actually do conceptualize              democracy.  It is quite possible that these conceptualizations will             arise in ways not accounted for in existing models of democracy.",
