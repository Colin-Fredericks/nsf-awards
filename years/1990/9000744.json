 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduate students will participate in a ten-week                     comprehensive research experience. In accordance with his/her                   interests, each student will do one of the following: 1) join in a              project investigating strains in geomaterials in underground water              disposal tunnels; 2) investigate advanced acoustic wave propagation             methods to detect flaws in materials 3) use laser interferometry to             detect crack propagation in brittle materials; 4) join in an exciting           development of a new fast-scan scanning electron Microscope; 5) use a           new interactive graphical program to analyze a fracture mechanics               problem; 6) assist in an experimental effort to understand internal             micro cracking of solids through data obtained for a x-ray device; 7)           assist in developing and testing video recording equipment to automate          construction operations; and 8) conduct a study to correlate the                intact and fissured properties of rocks using indicative techniques.            At least half of the students will be selected from applicants from             other institutions, especially those without active research programs.          Women, minority and handicapped applicants will particularly be                 recruited.  The students will become familiar with their projects               through early contact with the research director and will present a             preliminary seminar on the research.  Each student can expect to learn          to work quite independently over the course of the summer.  He/she              will also present a final seminar on the research, assist in writing a          publication describing the work, and may travel to a meeting to                 present the results.",
