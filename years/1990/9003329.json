 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in analytic number theory                 of Professor Daniel Goldston of San Jose State University. Dr.                  Goldston's project involves a study of the fine details in the                  pattern of distribution of prime numbers. He plans to examine the               Hardy-Littlewood circle method and its application to the study                 of small gaps between primes and the exceptional sets for the                   Goldbach conjecture; the Riemann zeta function as a tool for                    studying large gaps between primes; Maier's method and                          differential delay questions; and connections of these methods                  with the emerging understanding of the duality between primes and               zeros of zeta functions.                                                             The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete                realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent                on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.                The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete                is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                  number theorists such as Professor Goldston, the field has had a                new rebirth.",
