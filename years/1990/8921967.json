 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the application of asymptotic               methods of singular perturbation type to boundary value problems                for ordinary and partial differential equations, integral                       equations and difference equations.  In particular, the problems                to be studied center on two types that are relevant to                          applications:  the effects of small random forces on the overall                behavior of solutions of deterministic dynamical systems and the                evolution of time-dependent solutions of boundary value problems                to steady states that possess interior layers.                                       A host of phenomena in nature are described by sets of                     equations that contain one or more formally small terms.  If one                were to try solving such equations numerically, for example, one                usually runs into difficulty because the small terms can                        complicate the problems dramatically.  An alternative method of                 solution, the one espoused in this proposal, is to take advantage               of the small terms by first simplifying the equations that                      contain the small terms and then solving the simplified                         equations.  The PI's will use this idea to solve various problems               in probability theory and chemical physics.",
