 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately three million years ago the emergence of the Isthmus            of Panama from the sea divided the American tropical marine fauna               in two, profoundly affecting the evolution and geographic distribution          of many animals.  The time of severance of deep.water connections               has been studied, but Dr. Collins will determine the time of final              closure using shallow.water benthic foraminifera.  Fossil species of            these abundant protists indicate the water depths in which they                 formerly lived.  From strata dated with the newest biostratigraphic             zonations, a sequence of water depths through time from both sides of           the isthmus will be combined with taxonomic data on the biogeographic           divergence of East Pacific and Caribbean foraminifera to date and the           final closure of the isthmus.  Standard laboratory and analytical               methods will be used.  The date of termination of the marine                    connection is important to evolutionary studies in paleontology,                molecular biological studies of rates of genetic divergence, and                calculations of regional tectonic uplift and the terrestrial                    interchange of South and North American vertebrates.                              Interactions with the host institution include:  teaching an                  undergraduate course in biostratigraphy, leading a graduate seminar             in paleobiogeography, co-teaching summer geology field camp, and                arranging guest lectures by established women paleontologists.                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
