 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scowcroft's work, in mathematical logic, will center on                    constructive mathematics and the model-theory of p-adic fields.                      Having found an effective test for the constructive truth of               propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical complexity,                 Scowcroft hopes to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these                 constructively true propositions.  He also wants to learn whether               first-order real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic               analysis is recursively undecidable.  Scowcroft's new model for                 intuitionistic analysis may permit him to develop a new model for               first-order real algebra, and recent work on subanalytic sets may               allow him to extend his effective test for constructive truth to                propositions involving certain transcendental functions.                             In the model-theory of p-adic fields, Scowcroft plans to                   study the properties of definable equivalence relations, the                    differences in expressive power between the first-order languages               commonly used to describe a p-adic field, and the efficiency of                 quantifier-elimination procedures for Macintyre's first-order                   theory of the p-adics.                                                               These issues in the foundations of algebra bring modern                    mathematical logic to bear upon another related area.  Syntheses                of this sort have been the source of some of the most significant               mathematics of our time.",
