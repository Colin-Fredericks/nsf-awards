 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long Island University will conduct a three-year program for 900 middle         and secondary school mathematics teachers in New York. This project,            called \"Fellows for the Advancement of Mathematics Education2 (FAME2)\",         builds on a highly successful and widely replicated NSF project FAME            that has been ongoing over the past three years.  Participants are              Fellows (leaders) and the middle group of teachers considered as                possible future Fellows. Enhancement activities will include training of        under-prepared teachers by the Fellows.  The Fellows will serve as              school building leaders and form mathematics resource teams, with               responsibilities for inservice and parent training, pupil assessment,           promulgating the Standards, curriculum development, recruitment, and the        selection and training of under-prepared teachers.  The project includes        the development of a network of schools, universities, and educational          agencies.  The project includes features designed to increase the               participation of under-represented groups in mathematics.  Long Island          University and the participating districts are contributing an amount           equal to 90% of the NSF request.",
