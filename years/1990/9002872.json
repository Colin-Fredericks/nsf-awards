 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of                    stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B                  (UVB, 280-320nm) radiation.  The magnitude of ultraviolet                       radiation reaching the surface now approaches that measured in                  tropical latitudes. Perhaps more importantly, UVB radiation has                 increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-400nm) and                       photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700nm) have                    remained unchanged.  Recent improvements in atmospheric modeling                and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in a               six week field study during the austral spring 1990.  The prime                 objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the                 phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom.  During               this time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions                  for increased UVB susceptibility.  Biological and bio-optical                   information will be used to define and quantify linkages between                ozone-dependent oscillations in UV to PAR ratios and                            phytoplankton productivity.  Special emphasis will be place on                  defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and                      altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to                 photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms                      operating in the Southern Ocean.  The overall aim is to test the                hypothesis that phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely                 influenced by ozone depletion.",
