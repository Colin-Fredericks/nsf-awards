 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the diagenesis of a partially                         dolomitized sequence of Upper Miocene reefal limestones cropping                out on the island of Mallorca, Spain.  Unusually good exposures                 of these ancient reefs has allowed Dr. Luis Pomar (Univ. of the                 Balearic Islands) to define a detailed sedimentological and                     stratigraphic framework and to relate periods of reef growth and                erosion to changes in relative sea level.  This previous work is                an ideal framework for our proposed detailed study of post-                     depositional changes (diagenetic alterations) that took place                   when the reefs and carbonate sediments were transformed to                      limestone and dolomite.  In collaboration with L. Pomar we have                 begun field work, and have begun petrography and geochemistry at                Stony Brook.  The fundamental goal of our project is to                         quantitatively decipher the dolomitization processes and their                  rates.  Our approach is to combine detailed field work with                     laboratory studies:  petrography (plane-light, luminescence,                    scanning electron microscopy), transmission electron microscopy,                fluid inclusion work, geochemical studies (O, C, Sr, B isotopes;                Ca, Mg, Sr, Mn, Fe, Na abundances) of dolomites and associated                  diagenetic calcites.  Quantitative modeling of geochemical data                 and of potential dolomitizing fluids will be used within the                    geologic constraints to develop a model(s) for the diagenetic                   processes acting on the reef complex.",
