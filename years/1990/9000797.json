 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a summer's research experience for                    eight undergraduate geology majors.  Of the participants, two to                four of the students and one to three of the faculty involved,                  will be from schools other than Furman.  These outside                          participants will be drawn from the geology programs of schools                 that belong to two consortia of which Furman is a member.  These                schools include Millsaps College, Centenary College, The                        University of the South, The College of Wooster, Oberlin College,               Denison University, and Ohio Wesleyan University.  Faculty                      involved will work with one or two students to direct them in a                 10-week research effort.  As the summer progresses, the student                 will be encouraged to become increasingly more independent.  The                goal of each effort will be to produce valid verifiable results                 that will contribute to the body of knowledge in geology and that               can be presented to the scientific community in the form of a                   presented paper or journal article.  The overall goal of the                    program will be educating the student to understand the process                 of research and instilling in him an excitement about his field                 that will encourage him to continue on to graduate school.",
