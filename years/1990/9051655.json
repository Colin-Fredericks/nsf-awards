 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to develop an improved instrument-based                undergraduate field course in Oceanography.  This is the final                  course taken by Oceanography undergraduates and is designed to                  complement their formal classroom training with an exposure to                  state-of-the-art methods for sample collection, analysis, and                   data interpretation.                                                                                                                                                 Oceanography 460 is an undergraduate field course designed                 to develop skills in oceanography research.  Course activities                  include the establishment of objectives and the planning of a                   scientific field experiment, preparation of necessary equipment,                collection of data from an oceanographic research vessel, and                   data analysis and interpretation techniques.  Scientific results                are presented both orally and in written form.                                                                                                                       Over the past five years, the numbers of students in our                   undergraduate program have increased by more than 25% thus                      increasing the requirements for equipment, instructional                        personnel, and ship time.  The course is also interdisciplinary,                demanding modern equipment for concurrent projects in biological,               chemical, geological and physical aspects of oceanography in                    which students interact and execute a cooperative field program.                                                                                                     State-of-the-art sampling equipment and analytical                         instrumentation are critically necessary to make OCEAN 460 a                    rewarding educational experience for our undergraduate students.                This enclosed request for equipment would greatly enhance and                   improve this expanding course and provide more opportunities for                upper division student research.",
