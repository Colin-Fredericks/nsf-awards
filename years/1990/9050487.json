 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser applications impact virtually every branch of science.  In                chemistry, the laser has revolutionized the fields of high                      resolution spectroscopy and molecular reaction dynamics.                        However, relatively few institutions offer laboratory instruction               using lasers at the undergraduate level.  A sequence of laser                   experiments is being taught in the Physical Chemistry curriculum                for chemistry majors at this institution.  The experimental                     sequence has been carefully devised to teach students the                       underlying principles of laser operation and to introduce them to               useful and exciting applications of lasers in chemistry.  In one                experiment, students develop a basic understanding of the                       essential components in a laser by \"building\" a helium-neon laser               and characterizing the emitted laser beam.  In a subsequent                     experiment, students obtain a laser induced fluorescence (LIF)                  spectrum of iodine with a pulsed dye laser.  This experiment                    introduces students to a tunable laser and demonstrates the                     advantage of frequency resolution when using a laser for                        spectroscopy.  In another experiment, students use the same                     pulsed dye laser system to measure electronic energy transfer                   rates from pyrimidine to various buffer gases.  This experiment                 vividly demonstrates the temporal resolution afforded by laser                  measurement of dynamic processes.  The results of this project                  are being communicated to the general scientific educational                    community through presentations at professional meetings, and in                teaching journal articles.                                                                                                                                      The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
