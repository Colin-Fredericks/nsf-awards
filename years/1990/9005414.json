 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling of continental crustal evolution requires improved                     understanding of lower crustal rock types, compositions, and                    structure.  Recent geophysical transects in the Basin and Range                 and the Basin and Range-to-Colorado Plateau (BR-CP) transition                  zone have raised questions about the nature and development of                  the lower crust and the crust-mantle boundary in this region.                   Flat Moho topography beneath the Basin and Range, and multiple,                 sub-horizontal Moho reflectors beneath the Basin and Range and                  the BR-CP transition zone have lead to suggestions that basaltic                underplating played an important role in the development of the                 Basin and Range lower crust and crust-mantle boundary during                    Cenozoic extension.                                                             Xenoliths from Wikieup, Arizona provide actual rock samples from                the crust-mantle boundary beneath the BR-CP transition zone.                    This xenolith suite includes abundant composite nodules of upper                mantle peridotite in contact with lower crustal gabbro and                      granulite.  Complete petrographic and compositional analysis                    (minerals, whole rock major, trace, and rare elements, isotopes)                will be used to determine the petrogenesis of lower crustal rock                types.  Xenolith thermobarometry will provide estimates of the                  thermal state of the lower crust in this region.                                Integration of complete petrologic data with existing geophysical               data will allow evaluation of the role of processes such as                     basaltic underplating in the evolution of the Basin and Range                   lower crust and the development of the crust-mantle boundary.",
