 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the discovery of deep-sea-floor hydrothermal vents,                  bivalves that contain endosymbiotic bacteria have been identified               in a wide variety of reducing marine environments.  These novel                 symbioses have attracted much research into understanding the                   relationship between the host and bacteria.  A major problem that               has eluded investigators is the mechanisms by which the symbionts               are transmitted from generation to generation.  This problem,                   until recently, was unapproachable because the early life stages                of these bivalves were not available nor was there a technique                  that could resolve bacteria at a fine enough scale.                                  Several species of symbiont-containing bivalves can now be                 cultured through metamorphosis, and provide an ideal model system               to address this problem.  In situ hybridization techniques                      incorporating the use of oligonucleotide fluorescent probes are                 now routinely used to differentiate and enumerate eukaryotic and                prokaryotic cells.  Employing these techniques, it will be                      possible to determine the initial site of infection and the                     cellular process of the incorporation of the symbiont during the                early developmental stages of the host.  This research will                     address three specific questions:  what is the mechanism of                     symbiont transmission, what are the cellular processes of                       symbiont incorporation into the host tissue, and what is the                    metabolic state of the symbiont during the process of                           incorporation?",
