 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two decades separating the first and second world wars were                 bracketed by far-reaching new discoveries in nuclear physics.  In               1919, Ernest Rutherford discovered artificial disintegration and                in 1938, Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassman and Lisa Meitner discovered                 nuclear fission.  Under this grant, Professor Stuewer is                        investigating the routes followed by nuclear physicists in going                from the first of these discoveries to the second.  These                       discoveries fundamentally transformed the field and established                 nuclear physics as the most important branch of physics during and              after the second world war.  Professor Stuewer is tracing the                   origin and evolution of the nuclear models or theories during the               inter-war period and is setting the theoretical, experimental, and              instrumental developments that took place within their                          institutional, social and political contexts.  The PI has already               gathered the primary and secondary sources, both published and                  unpublished, necessary to carry out this research program.  He has              also already undertaken a series of studies that have prepared him              to complete this project.",
