The basic idea is to focus on instrumentation                     which (a) maximizes the leverage for equipment which is                         already in hand; (b) maximizes instrument sharing between                       other teaching telescopes at the University; and (c)                            involves a scientific project which is not trivial, but                         rather is representative of the very best kind of science                       one can do with the instruments at hand: the measurement of                     the global p-mode (sound wave) oscillations of the Sun.  The                    instrumentation is of sufficient capability that                                undergraduate students using the solar telescope will be                        able to make oscillation measurements which are at the level                    of publishable research, albeit obtained within the city                        limits of Chicago.  The University of Chicago will provide                      partial support for the project.",
