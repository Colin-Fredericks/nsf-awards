 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ehrenfeld and Parmelee have shown in greenhouse microcosm                  studies that live roots stimulate a rhizosphere effect                          proportional to the amount of root input in the nutrient-poor                   mineral soil of the pitch pine forests in the New Jersey                        Pinelands but have no such effect in the organic forest floor.                  Because this finding has important implications for nutrient                    cycling in forest ecosystems, field experimentation is required.                The investigators propose to test their results in a field                      experiment in which decomposition, N mineralization rate, fungal                and microfaunal abundance and soil leachate chemistry are                       followed for 2 years in plots of each soil horizon, into which                  varying quantities of live and dead roots are introduced.                            In undisturbed forests, the organic and mineral soil                       horizons are contiguous, however, and pathways of nutrient                      connection must exist.  Connections between horizons include                    fungal growth and translocation, leachate, and root growth, and                 these may influence nutrient cycling rates in an adjacent                       horizon.  Amounts of nutrient transferred from one horizon to the               other may be modified by roots and by faunal grazing.                                Therefore, Ehrenfeld and Parmelee proposed to conduct                      additional field and microcosm studies to identify which pathways               are most important in linking horizons, which response variables                are sensitive to the presence of connections, and how the                       connections are affected by root inputs.  They will use                         microcosms with reconstructed soil profiles to investigate how                  connections originating in organic horizon influence nutrient                   cycling rates in mineral soil.  They will use biocides and                      removal of leachate to determine relative importance of fungi and               leachate as connections, and to determine how soil fauna affect                 the magnitude of these connections.  The same response variables                as in the field experiment will be measured.  In the field they                 will quantify rate of fungal growth between horizons and flux of                N (15N) between horizons through fungi.  They will also determine               the influence of fauna on the nutrient quality of leachate.                          The institutional support for this research is excellent.                  The investigators are highly qualified productive research                      scientists.",
