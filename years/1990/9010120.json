 "awd_abstract_narration": "Object-oriented databases intend to support non-traditional                     database application areas such as artificial intelligence (AI),                computer-aided design (CAD), and office information systems                     (OIS). An important requirement of non-traditional database                     applications is the support of application evolution which                      includes evolution of schemas as well as objects. The overall                   goal of this research is to understand properties of dynamically                evolving objects and their schemas and find mechanisms for                      supporting them in object-oriented databases.                                                                                                                   One goal of this research is to implement an extensive schema                   manager having many useful capabilities for dynamic schema                      management, such as schema evolution, graphics schema editor,                   schema versioning, DAG rearrangement views, and logical database                schema design. Also, in this research, two more issues which are                closely related with dynamic schema management will be                          investigated: (1) storage model issue (i.e., ways of storing                    dynamic object instances), (2) the issue of how to achieve code                 (i.e., method) compatibility in the face of dynamic schema                      changes.                                                                                                                                                        This research contributes toward: (1) identifying data structures               and operations which are necessary to support dynamic schemas and               objects, (2) analyzing basic properties of storage models, and                  (3) investigating techniques for method conversion which can cope               with dynamic schema changes, in object-oriented databases.",
