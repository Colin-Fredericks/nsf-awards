 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to establish a core plant growth                   chamber facility at UNR.  Plant growth chambers are important                   pieces of equipment for plant biology research.  They provide                   scientists with the capacity to produce plants conditions.                      Control of temperature, photoperiod, light intensity and humidity               are necessary for research projects ranging from investigations                 of plant-environment interactions to production of transgenic                   plants.  Development of research programs in plant biology has                  been an important focus within the College of Agriculture at the                University of Nevada-Reno.  The development of such a core                      facility is an essential component in both the successful                       development of the research programs of many of these new plant                 biology faculty and the continued research productivity of our                  more established faculty members.  This plant growth chamber                    facility will initially support the research programs of six                    faculty members from three departments within the College os                    agencies.",
