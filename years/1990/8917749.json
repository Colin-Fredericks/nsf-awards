 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is linked to the carbon                 cycle by photosynthesis and respiration, and can be used as a                   tracer for studying elusive problems of carbon geochemistry.                    Oxygen is relatively insoluble in seawater.  Its atmospheric                    inventory, in contrast to the of carbon dioxide, is not buffered                by equilibrium with the oceans.  Global carbon and oxygen fluxes                are therefore nearly quantitatively reflected in the changing                   atmospheric oxygen concentration, and one can use the atmospheric               oxygen content as an integrator of seasonal and interannual                     fluxes of carbon and oxygen.                                                         The goal of this research project is to, develop an isotope                dilution - isotope ratio mass spectrometry method and to evaluate               its capability for measuring small changes in the atmospheric                   oxygen.  Together with the ongoing work of others this work will                also set the stage for more extensive future studies of the                     atmospheric oxygen cycle and its implications for the oceanic                   carbon cycle and the total rate of anthropogenic carbon dioxide                 production.  Oxygen is also linked to the carbon cycle by the                   combustion of fossil fuels and the global conversion of biomass                 into carbon dioxide.  There must be a gradual global decrease in                the atmospheric oxygen content which quantitatively reflects the                total rate oxygen consumption by these two processes.  The                      consumption rate by fossil fuel burning is well known.  One can                 thus measure the long term anthropogenic oxygen decrease, and                   calculate the biomass conversion rate by difference.",
