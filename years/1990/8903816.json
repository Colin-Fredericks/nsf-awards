 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines aspects of sphingolipid synthesis in                      plants.  The objectives are to characterize sphingolipid                        synthesis and its regulation at the point of long chain base                    formation; to characterize the enzymatic steps involved in                      modifying long chain base and fatty acid components of                          sphingolipids and investigate the metabolic interrelationships of               species involved in the formation  of glucosylceramide, the                     predominant plant sphingolipid; and to assess degradation and                   turnover of glucosylceramide.  Plant cell suspension cultures and               rye seedlings are used as experimental systems.  These two plant                systems have diverse glucosylceramide molecular species                         compositions.  The use of plant cell suspension cultures                        facilitates detailed in vivo studies of the regulation of                       sphingolipid synthesis and complements studies aimed at                         characterizing selected enzymatic steps in cell-free systems.                   Radiolabeled precursors are supplied in vitro or in vivo and the                incorporation into sphingolipid products determined following                   separation by TLC and HPLC.  Aspects of regulation are                          investigated under conditions in which sphingolipid metabolism is               altered as a consequence of development or in response to                       environmental factors or biochemical regulators.  It is                         anticipated that these studies, the first of their kind in plant                cells, will provide information on the cellular regulation of                   sphingolipid metabolism.                                                                                                                                        Current dogma holds that plant and animal cells respond to                      temperature stress by altering the lipid composition of their                   membranes.  Very little experimental evidence has been generated                to test this hypothesis.  This project provides new information                 on a newly discovered class of lipids and how they change in type               and amount when plants are exposed to low temperature.                          Fundamental new information on plant lipids will result.",
