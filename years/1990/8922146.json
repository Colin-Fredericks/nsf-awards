 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with the study of adaptive nonlinear filters and         their applications.  While the concept of linear filtering has had              enormous impact on the development of various techniques for processing         stationary and nonstationary signals, there are several applications in         which the performance of linear filters is unacceptable.  Channel               equalization and echo cancellation and echo cancellation in high                performance communication systems, image processing, characterization           of semiconductor devices, and modeling biological phenomenon are some           of the examples of applications in which nonlinear filters have been            successfully employed.  Possibly because of the computational complexity        associated with adaptive nonlinear filters, it is only recently  that           active research on such systems have begun.  The work deals with the            following four closely related problems in adaptive nonlinear filtering:        1) Development of efficient algorithms for adaptive nonlinear filters           using nonlinearities modeled with finite Volterra series expansions; 2)         Development of numerically stable fast recursive least-square Volterra          filters based on QR-decomposition techniques; 3) Study of adaptive              nonlinear filtering algorithms for systems where the nonlinearity is            modeled using recursive, nonlinear difference equations, with relatively        few parameters to adequately represent a large class of nonlinearities;         and 4) Analytical and empirical performance evaluation of the algorithms        developed.  These are all challenging and important problems that when          solved will result in substantial advances in our nonlinear signal              processing capabilities.",
