 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduced gas chromatography-mass spectrometry into               the undergraduate curriculum.  The instrument is used by students               in hands-on experiments so they will better see the relationship                between theoretical concepts and the data obtained.  The concept                of GC-MS Service Laboratory has also been implemented.  To do                   this, an autosampler was necessary and was acquired through this                project.  Students are trained to accept samples for GC-MS                      analysis from students in other courses, to run them and to                     return the laboratory results with explanations as needed.  The                 experiences are practical and valuable whether students go on to                graduate education or enter the working force immediately.                      Recent advances in column technology, instrument design,                        electronics and software have made this application a fesible                   project.  The institution acquired the Hewlett-Packard GC-MS with               autosampler and the NIST library of mass spectra.  One prominent                and important application of the instrument is in environmental                 analysis so a purge and trap collector was acquired.  Experiments               using GC-MS are done in the introductory and advanced organic                   laboratory , analytical and instrumental laboratories, physical                 chemical experiments that emphasize the use of GC to measure                    physical properties, and synthesis of volatile inorganics such as               chelates and carbonyls.  The instrument is also used by students                in their research projects in their senior year and for                         demonstrations/video presentations in required courses for non-                 science students.  The availability of the instrument had an                    immediate impact on the undergraduate curriculum.                                                                                                               The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
