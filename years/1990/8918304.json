 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current work is dedicated to the further exploration and               elucidation of those aspects of atomic and molecular physics                    dominated by strong interparticle correlation effects.  The basic               objective is to find a general and universal approach to the                    construction of atom-molecule eigenfunctions using hyperspherical               or coupled channel treatments.  The ultimate goal is to identify                the key dynamical mechanisms governing the processes of interest                and to describe them in terms of a few key variables.  The                      studies include two excited electrons outside a closed shell                    core, and electron in a magnetic field, and the dissociative                    attachment of electrons to H2.  The PI suggests that the                        fragmentation of a molecular complex can best be understood by                  examining the Jost matrices numerically.  Attention must be paid                to those regions where there is a breakdown of adibaticity for it               is in those regions where the \"chemical reactions\" occur.                       Outside of these regions there is a smooth behavior of the                      wavefunctions which is governed by the balance between coulomb                  and centrifugal forces as the partices recede from one another.                 The approach is quite ambitious but success to date has been very               limited.  The PI feels that the major barriers have now been                    removed and progress will be made quickly.",
