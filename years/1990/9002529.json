 "awd_abstract_narration": "The topological properties of an algebraic variety (the set                of solutions of some polynomial equations) will be studied in two               ways, using structures which are special to them.  First, there                 are notions of size and distance on the smooth part of an                       algebraic variety, inherited from its imbedding in space.  Using                this, one defines square-summable functions and, more generally,                differential forms on the smooth part of the variety.  The first                problem to be studied is to what extent the periods of these                    functions or forms are determined by the topological properties                 of the variety, in particular, by a topological invariant called                \"the intersection homology group.\"  The second problem is to find               ways to relate quantitative measures of the intersection of                     cycles on the variety with its local topological properties.                         These geometrical investigations will not be confined to the               non-singular case, rendering them more difficult, yet more                      suitable of application to spaces which arise in theoretical                    physics and in other analytic theories.",
