The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. David A. Hoffman                     of Harvard University will support a twelve-month visit to                      France by Dr. Derk A. Wierda to work with Professeur John A.                    Osborn of the Institut Le Bel of the Universit\u001a Louis Pasteur                   in Strasbourg on \"Activation and Functionalization of                           Chlorocarbons.\"  Chlorocarbons form a relatively inert class                    of compounds with properties which can be useful, such as                       solvent, or noxious, such as chlorinated aromatics (PCBs).                      It has recently been discovered that a series of complexes of                   Pd(0) will activate C-Cl bonds under mild conditions.  Such                     complexes also serve as catalysts for the carbonylation of                      CH2Cl2 and C6H5Cl.  The original work into chlorocarbon                         activation will be extended to other chloro- and polychloro-                    containing compounds.  The researchers will conduct mechanistic                 studies to better understand how the process of chlorocarbon                    activation occurs.  The will perform further research into                      potential catalytics reactions involving these systems.  One                    possible reaction of interest is hydrodechlorination, a                         process by which chlorocarbons would be transformed into                        hydrocarbons.  Reaction of CH2Cl2 in the presence of CO, H2,                    base and palladium complex catalytically generates ketene, a                    very reactive organic molecule.  The researchers will                           investigate this process in the presence of various ketene                      traps.  They will examine generation of other ketenes in                        situ.  They shall perform investigations into the possibility                   of breaking the much stronger C-F bonds by similar methods.                                                                                                     The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
