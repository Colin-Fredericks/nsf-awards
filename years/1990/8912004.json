 "awd_abstract_narration": "The narrowness of the neovolcanic zone at MORs and the                     variations in ridge crest topography are poorly understood.  It                 is generally agreed that pressure-release melting at depths                     between 20 and 100 km occurs beneath ridge crests and that the                  melt is segregated from the mantle and rises because of density                 differences to form the ocean crust.  Recently acquired seismic                 data suggest that the zone of upwelling beneath ridges is much                  narrower than theoretical models predict.  The observed                         topographic highs at fast-spreading ridges and the lows at                      slow-spreading ridges are also not predicted by the models.                          The PI has developed a new model wherein mantle viscosity is               temperature dependent and is coupled to the fraction of melt                    present.  This produces a narrow upwelling zone in better                       agreement with observations.  He proposes to run through a large                number of calculations to determine the range of conditions that                produce narrow upwelling and melting below the ridge, looking in                particular at the effects of varying the permeability, and how                  the model affects topography.",
