 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to develop a natural resource management              practicum for upper division students enrolled in the School of                 Forestry, Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Natural Resources             at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  In order to facilitate                 field data collection, this award will be used for the acquisition              of portable electronic field data recorders.  These field data                  recorders will be used by a team of students with backgrounds in                forestry, fisheries and wildlife to gather biological data on a                 real tract of land.  These data will then be downloaded to existing             portable computers for input into biological simulation models to               analyze and evaluate different proposed natural resource management             regimes for the tract of land.  The proposed practicum will bring               together young professionals in an outdoor setting where they will              be expected to develop an integrated plan for the management of                 multiple natural resources, under various disciplinary resource                 constraints and objectives, and work together as a multi-                       disciplinary team.  Additionally, this course will serve as a                   feedback mechanism which can be used by the School to assess the                quality of the natural resource program.  The grantee is matching               this award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
