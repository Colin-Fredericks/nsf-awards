 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maltose fermentation in Saccharomyces is initiated by its                       active transport into the cell by maltose permease.  The                        level of activity of maltose permease is under dual                             regulation.  Firstly, transcription of the gene encoding                        maltose permease is maltose-induced and glucose-repressed.                      Secondly, maltose permease is glucose-inactivated, that is,                     the ability to transport maltose is rapidly lost following                      the addition of glucose to an induced culture.  This research                   will determine the mechanism of glucose-induced inactivation                    of maltose permease.  The MAL61 gene which encodes maltose                      permease at the MAL6 locus has been sequenced.  Antibody to                     maltose permease will be isolated and used to follow the fate                   of the maltose permease protein during glucose-induced                          inactivation.  Antibody will be raised to fusion products or                    to peptides.  The kinetics of maltose transport and of                          glucose-induced inactivation of maltose permease will be                        determined in genetically defined strains.  The possibility                     that maltose permease is modified, selectively removed from                     the plasma membrane or proteolytically degraded during the                      inactivation process will be explored.  Also, glucose                           inactivation resistant mutations in MAL61 using in vitro                        mutagenesis techniques will be isolated.                                                                                                                        In the regulation of cellular growth and metabolism, cells                      are often responding to changes in the extra-cellular                           environment and this response is mediated by integral                           membrane proteins.  Glucose-induced inactivation of maltose                     permease is an example of such a regulatory system.  The cell                   is responding to changes in the extra-cellular levels of                        glucose but the \"glucose receptor\" remains undefined and the                    intracellular response is poorly understood.  This research                     will provide insight into these processes.  It will also                        provide an opportunity to study protein turnover and                            subcellular localization as mechanisms of regulation.  These                    regulatory mechanisms are important and poorly understood                       processes involved in memory, aging and differentiation.",
