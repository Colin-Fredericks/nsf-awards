 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well-recognized that women are underrepresented in science                and engineering studies. Their low representation is cause for                  concern because of its implications for the quality of the                      scientific and engineering labor force in the United States.  It                is well-known that gender differences in performance and                        interest in science and mathematics begin as early as junior                    high school.  Understanding the factors that contribute to the                  differences are crucial in bringing about change.                                                                                                               This research on antecedents of academic achievement will                       contribute to understanding this crucial period.   The research                 focuses on home and school circumstances, including parental                    encouragement and peer pressures, that contribute to change in                  academic achievement over a two to four year period after 7th                   and 9th grades.  The sample includes 2,236 students who attended                14 South Carolina public schools in 1986.  The results will show                how differential development in academic achievement of girls                   and boys during adolescence is related to a variety of                          conditions in early adolescence, reflecting the student's                       abilities and orientations, and his/her relationships with the                  major agencies of socialization--the family, the school, the                    peer group, and mass media.",
