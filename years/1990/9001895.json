 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bonahon will study limit sets of Kleinian groups and of                    hyperbolic groups.  A Kleinian group is a discrete group of                     isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.  Bonahon intends to study the                 topological type of the limit set of a Kleinian group and show                  that it is determined by the algebraic structure of the group                   together with certain geometric invariants of the associated                    quotient space.  He also wants to study the asymptotic behavior                 of the leaves of foliations of hyperbolic 3-space which are                     invariant under a Kleinian group (namely lifts of foliations of                 hyperbolic 3-manifolds) and to analyze how fast these leaves                    approach the limit set of the group.                                                 Following Gromov's terminology, a hyperbolic group is a                    finitely generated group which has certain growth properties                    similar to those of a cocompact Kleinian group.  Such a                         hyperbolic group has a well defined limit set, also called its                  boundary.  Bonahon wants to analyze how certain topological                     properties of the limit set of a hyperbolic group are related to                algebraic properties of the group, involving in particular its                  outer automorphism group and decompositions into amalgamated                    products.                                                                            Advances in the study of 3-dimensional manifolds in recent                 years, following work of Thurston, has rather surprisingly shown                the extreme relevance of hyperbolic geometry to the understanding               of the structure of 3-manifolds.",
