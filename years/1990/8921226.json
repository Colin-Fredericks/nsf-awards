 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies supports research and educational                     projects on ethical and value aspects of the interaction between                science, technology and society.  Projects examine the social                   values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in                these interactions.  One important area for examination concerns                new advances in the biosciences that may be applied to research and             develop efficacious biological warfare (BW) agents.  This threat                is so serious that the Department of Defense (DoD) has increased                its biological defense research program.  As a consequence, many                scientists are given the opportunity to undertake BW-related                    research.  When considering this opportunity, scientists face                   difficult questions related to personal values, professional                    ethics, responsibilities stemming from international law, and                   duties towards their country.  It is the main objective of the                  proposed conference to clarify these issues.  A second objective                draws scholars' attention to the availability of the American                   Society for Microbiology's (ASM) archives for research on the                   history of microbiology in the U. S.  The conference, and its                   published proceedings, will generate information that will help                 scientists decide whether to undertake DoD funded research; it will             delineate the roles of scientific societies in guiding their                    members; and it will inform the public of these difficult questions             so it can make informed decisions.  The ASM and other scientific                organizations are co-sponsors of the conference.                                The principal investigator, planning committee members, and                     speakers for the conference are highly qualified; sponsorship is                appropriate; the issues are important; results will be                          appropriately disseminated.  The project is meritorious and                     recommended for award.",
