Binuclear molybdenum                    compounds with sulfide and hydrosulfide bridging ligands have                   been synthesized and found to catalyze the oligomerization of                   isobutene.  Investigation of the mechanism of this reaction is                  planned so that the selectivity and stability of this catalyst                  can be compared to known catalysts for similar reactions.                                                                                                       One part of the investigation will focus on reaction surveys,                   stoichiometric reactions, and Extended Huckel Molecular Orbital                 calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism.  A second                   part of the project will be to synthesize new compounds in                      which the bridging and/or terminal ligands have been altered to                 enhance catalytic activity either by placing the substrate in                   proximity of the hypothetically critical bridging ligand or by                  increasing the likelihood that a vacant coordination site will                  form.",
