 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the membranes of the                                      thermoacidophilic archaebacteria and the acidophilic                            thiobacilli.  These bacteria live in harsh environments                         including low pH (2-4) and high temperature (50-70C).  Due                      to the unusual aspects of such environments it is                               hypothesized that they will have unusual membranes which                        allow them to survive at extremes of pH and temperature.                        In fact, it is known that the archaebacteria as a group do                      not have normal ester lipids but rather tetraether lipids.                      The foundation of the proposal is that the unusual nature                       of the membranes of these bacteria will provide lipids and                      ion transport proteins distinct from those in eukaryotic                        membranes.  These differences will be informative in                            understanding both the cell biology of these bacteria and                       the function of eukaryotic lipids and ion transport                             proteins.  This project proposes to use the expertise in                        two laboratories to study the lipids and proteins in the                        membranes of these bacteria.  This project comprises two                        sub-projects, one on ion transport proteins in Dr. Smith's                      laboratory and the other on lipids and lipid protein                            interactions in Dr. Chong's laboratory as outlined below.                                                                                                       Sub-project 1:  Identification and characterization the                         membrane ATPases associated with transmembrane ion                              transport in acidophilic thiobacilli and                                        thermoacidophilic archaebacteria.  The goals of this sub-                       project are to:                                                                                                                                                 1. Screen the membranes of various strains of                                   archaebacteria and acidophilic thiobacilli for ion                              translocating ATPases using immunologic and enzymatic                           assays.                                                                                                                                                         2. Characterize the ATPase activities found in specific                         aim 1, with regard to inhibitor specificity, pH optima,                         cation transport and kinetic properties.                                                                                                                        3. Purify of some of the proteins associated with the                           ATPase activities described in specific aims 1 and 2.                           Particular emphasis will be placed on P-type ATPases.                                                                                                           Sub-project 2:  Characterization of the physical                                properties of membranes comprised of tetraether lipids                          isolated from thermoacidophilic archaebacteria.  In this                        sub-project:                                                                                                                                                    1. Steady-state and dynamic fluorometry will be employed                        to investigate the lateral motion of pyrene-labeled lipids                      and the rotational motion of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) and                       perylene in tetraether lipid membranes.                                                                                                                         2. The lateral and rotational motions of small molecules                        in tetraether lipid membranes as a function of pressure                         will be studied using high pressure fluorometry.                                                                                                                3. Fluorometry and conventional biochemical methods will                        be used to study the topology of archaebacterial (Na+,K+)-                      type ATPase in tetraether lipid membranes.",
