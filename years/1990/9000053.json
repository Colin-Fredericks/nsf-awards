 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical theories of multivariate polynomial                       interpolation and multivariate spline approximation differ in                   content and goals, yet share a common source.  In addition, many                of the mathematical tools used to analyze basic questions are                   similar.  Underlying much of this work has been the problem of                  developing a strategy for developing a theory of splines in                     several dimensions which is both computationally effective and as               accurate as the one dimensional basis from which the subject                    arose.                                                                               Work on multivariate polynomial interpolation derives from                 problems in what became known as box spline theory.  A                          surprisingly simple and general method for choosing, for any                    given finite set of points in a space of several variables, a                   good polynomial space for interpolation at those points, has been               discovered.  Work will now be done exploring the theoretical and                practical ramifications of this discovery.  A long-term objective               is to construct a coherent theory of interpolation, one which                   will play a more important role in multivariate numerical                       analysis.                                                                            There are many approaches to spline approximation in higher                dimensions currently in use.  Each is associated with a certain                 type of mesh along which the elements are joined.  The focus of                 this work will be that of approximation order.  A better                        understanding of what makes for a good approximation order is                   expected to lead to the construction of better approximation                    methods. Ultimately, one would like to develop a unification of                 the various theories and techniques now extant.                                      A particularly important area of application of this work is               in providing mathematical models of surfaces, often from a given                set of bounding curves.  The mainstay of industrial work at this                time is a method which only works for relatively flat surfaces.                 One immediate goal is to obtain a better understanding of how                   one can tell whether a given surface can be well represented by a               small number of patches.",
