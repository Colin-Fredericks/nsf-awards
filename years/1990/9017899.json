 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to develop parallel methods for                       solving unconstrained optimization problems and to                              implement them on a 1024-processor hypercube such as the                        NCUBE 1 machine at the University of South Carolina.  In                        particular, she proposes to parallelize those parts of the                      algorithm that are costly and where speedups are most                           useful, namely the linear algebra solution and updating.                        The PI wants to approach the problem by finding updating                        strategies for the Hessian on the basis of the type of                          linear equation solver used to find the direction dk.                           These would not include, for example, the factored or                           unfactored parallel versions of the BFGS method using                           either the Hessian or its inverse since these have already                      been parallelized.  The PI would consider two methods for                       solving linear equations:  a) the LU factorization or some                      variation of it, and b) an iterative method using multiple                      blocks.  In summary, the PI would like to parallelize a                         quasi-Newton method for solving unconstrained optimization                      problems using LU updates and to find updating schemes for                      the Hessian where the Hessian is split into multiple                            blocks.",
