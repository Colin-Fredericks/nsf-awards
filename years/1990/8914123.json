 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative                   research project between Dr. Robert S. Brodkey of Ohio State                    University and Dr. Ivan Fort of the Czech Technical University is               to formulate and test better theoretical approaches to problems of              solids transport.  Of particular interest is the definition of the              buoyancy term in a force balance when used to describe solid                    particle motion.  The researchers intend to measure the turbulent               fluctuations of both liquid and solid in a two-phase, dense,                    solid-liquid mixture.  They will use invisible and marked particles             to enable optical diagnostics of the flow turbulence between                    particles.  Both particle motion and fluid motion are to be                     mapped, for comparison to particle predictions from a theory                    developed by the Czechoslovak partner.  Results  should yield new               data on turbulence flow, with and without particles, and may                    resolve a theoretical controversy about the role of buoyancy in                 equations of motion.                                                                                                                                            This project in fluid dynamics research fulfills the program                    objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in              the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                   talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
