 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past two decades, the prevalence of violence against                 women has been extensively studied.  Citizens generally support                 the right of individuals to defend themselves against violence,                 but this support appears to break down for some women victims such              as battered women who turn on their batterers.  The majority of the             research about rape and battering has not dealt with the issue of               female victims fighting back, especially fighting that results in               homicide.  Recently, some explorations have been made on the                    historical and legal reasons affecting the perception of women                  acting in self-defense following physical and/or sexual abuse.                  However, the issues are complex and in need of further exploration.                                                                                             This Research Opportunities for Women Planning Grant will allow                 this young investigator to undertake preliminary research prior to              developing a full scale project on gender politics in self-defense.             The project will be the first to examine systematically the social              constructions of self-defense in situations where women are                     physically and sexually abused.  The pilot project will include                 open-ended interviews that ask victims, judges, prosecutors, and                defense lawyers about their perceptions of self-defense in various              situations.  The results of the interviews will be used to                      construct a set of vignettes that will be used in a full-scale                  project.                                                                                                                                                        This research will add valuable insight to our understanding of                 whether belief in rights to self-defense varies by social                       categories.  Questions relating to whether the right to self-                   defense is granted differently to men and women and to black and                white women have great theoretical significance.  Also, such                    research will be of practical significance to those interested in               legal reforms related to the self-defense of women against                      violence.",
