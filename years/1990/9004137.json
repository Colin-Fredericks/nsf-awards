 "awd_abstract_narration": "While considerable progress has been made in the past three years               on the static typechecking of object-oriented languages, object-                oriented databases pose additional problems.  In particular we                  need to clarify the relationship between type and extent.  The                  relationship EMPLOYEE < PERSON as a relationship between classes                or types says something about the inheritance of methods, while                 in a database context it also means set inclusion.  There is an                 apparent contradiction: how can a set of one type be a subset of                a set of some other type?  The use of \"partially dynamic\" types                 is investigated in order to resolve this issue, which will allow                us to deal with heterogeneous collections in a statically typed                 system.  The rules for type checking for heterogeneous                          collections appear to be closely related to those already                       developed for manipulating relational databases.  If this is the                case, then type inference should also be possible. Research plan                includes development of a prototype language that demonstrates                  the feasibility of these ideas.",
