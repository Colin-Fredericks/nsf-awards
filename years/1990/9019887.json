 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is to examine the effects that partially              penetrating wells and ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the                   three-dimensional capture zone.  The results of this project will               help determine whether modeled pump-out systems are actually                    performing as predicted, for certain cases. Preliminary                         recommendations on improvement of pump-out system design could come             out of this work. The most important issues to be explored are: 1)              the importance to model wells as partially penetrating; 2) the                  relationship between the depth and width of the three-dimensional               capture zone and the discharge rate of the partially penetrating                well; 3) the effect that ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the                width and depth of the capture zone of a partially penetrating                  well, as compared to the homogeneous aquifer. This work will be                 done for the purpose of developing more realistic and useful                    modeling techniques for use in pump-out system design. Development              of engineering heuristics and tools will be the final outcome.",
