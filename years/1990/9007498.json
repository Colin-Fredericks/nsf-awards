 "awd_abstract_narration": "On September 17-18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo almost completely                 deforested portions of the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto               Rico.  Hurricane deforestation differs substantially from other                 disturbances that have been studied in tropical forests (logging,               slash and burn agriculture) principally in that an enormous                     amount of live biomass instantly enters the surface litter                      compartment.  Insufficient data exist to predict how this litter                input will affect or be affected by nutrient dynamics in the                    riparian zone of this tropical forest.                                               Drs. McDowell, Bowden and Smith have been sampling near-                   surface ground water and stream water at two sites in this forest               since August 1988.  Their work emphasizes the nutrient and water                flux through the riparian zone and assesses the relative                        importance of microbial versus vascular plant control of nutrient               flux through this interface.                                                         This new project will examine the impact of deforestation                  caused by Hurricane Hugo on the ability of riparian zones to                    regulate transport of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic                     ecosystems.  The investigators hypothesize that the riparian                    zone plays a crucial role in regulating losses of nitrogen                      following this catastrophic disturbance.  They specifically                     identify two major hypotheses: 1) deforestation associated with                 Hurricane Hugo will result in increased fluvial export of                       nitrogen from the Bisley watershed, and 2) the magnitude of                     nitrogen export in stream water will be lessened significantly by               nitrogen retention and transformation.  To test these hypotheses,               information from before and after Hurricane Hugo will be compared               at two sites, one disturbed and one undisturbed.                                     The scientists engaged in this research are experienced,                   productive researchers who have previous experience with riparian               processes in tropical forests.  The program is supported by                     excellent institutional facilities.",
