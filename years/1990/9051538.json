 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modern approach to laboratory instruction in physiology is being              implemented using computers to interface with scientific                        instrumentation. The new laboratory consists of five computer                   workstations serving as the primary laboratory tool for groups of               3-5 students. The computer at each station is equipped with a                   complete data acquisition center by interfacing either with                     mechanical devices such as strain gauges for muscle contraction,                nerve chambers for nervous impulse monitoring, or transducers for               monitoring EKG, oxygen, temperature, and pH. The computer also                  controls a spectrophotometer for monitoring colorimetric reactions              for hemoglobin and enzyme analysis. These workstations supersede                polygraphs and oscilloscopes which needed upgrading. The                        workstations should thoroughly familiarize students with computer               technology while allowing the use of state-of-the-art                           instrumentation and computerized data acquisition and analysis.                 They are utilized by several different physiology classes, and                  provide instrumentation for students pursuing independent study                 projects. The university is contributing an amount equal to the                 award.",
