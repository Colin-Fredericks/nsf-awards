 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of the reversible phosphorylation of proteins, as                a mechanism for the control of cell function, is well documented.               A strategy has been initiated whereby cloned genes for the                      catalytic subunits of several protein phosphatases are expressed                in cells under the control of a regulatable promoter.  Mutant                   phosphatases with truncated carboxyl and/or amino termini are                   also being constructed and tested for expression and activity in                several cell types.  By using this genetic approach, it is                      proposed that specific phosphorylation events can be markedly                   blunted or rapidly reversed thus altering the normal protein                    kinase activated pathways in the cell.  The role of protein                     phosphorylation cascades and their regulation by specific                       phosphatases can be studied in relationship to cell metabolism,                 growth, and differentiation.  An additional goal of this project                is to characterize the repertoire of protein phosphatases in                    selected cell types using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and DNA               sequencing.  This will allow us to estimate the number and nature               of protein phosphatases within a specific cell type, as well as                 potentially identifying new phosphatase genes.",
