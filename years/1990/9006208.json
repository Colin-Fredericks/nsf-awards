 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McKitrick at the University of Michigan will study                     evolutionary relationships within a large group of birds that                   includes the sandpipers, stilts, plovers, gulls, terns and auks                 (Order Charadriiformes).  This group is of great interest from an               evolutionary perspective because its members, while presumably                  closely related, show a wide variety of adaptations for life in                 and around water and are consequently a very diverse assemblage.                Many of these adaptations have involved internal as well as                     external anatomical changes.  This has led to spirited debate                   among biologists about the significance of certain anatomical                   similarities and differences among these birds:  do the                         similarities reflect close genealogical relationship or are they                merely independent occurrences that have evolved in response to                 similar environmental conditions?  This proposal will address                   such questions using data from the hindlimb musculature and from                the anatomy of the vocal apparatus.  The study will yield                       hypotheses about genealogical relationships within the group, as                well as about how the internal anatomy has evolved.  The study                  will also result in a large body of descriptive data that will be               of great use in other comparative studies about evolutionary                    trends in vertebrate anatomy.",
