 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution acquired a FT-IR                          spectrometer and ATR and diffuse reflectance accessories.  The                  instrument replaced a dispersive IR that was purchased in 1965                  for which repair costs had frequently exceeded the value of the                 instrument and replacement parts were no longer available.  The                 FT-IR is being used in courses such as organic, physical,                       spectrometric identification of organic compounds, and                          introduction to research.  In addition to being used for the                    experiments previously done with the dispersive IR, the new                     instrument and accessories enable the students to carry out new                 experiments such as spectra of aqueous and dilute solutions,                    opaque solids such as polymers and minerals, cut outs from TLC                  separations, and high resolution spectra of gases.  The computer                controlled instrument allows the manipulation of data in                        analyzing mixtures and the creation of one's own spectral                       library.  Also of prime importance is the fact that industrial                  employees and graduate schools expect that a bachelor's degree                  chemist can operate a FT-IR instrument and is familiar with the                 mathematical manipulations and capabilities of the Fourier                      transform technique.  The FT-IR also played an important role in                the phasing in of microscale in the organic chemistry labs.                                                                                                     The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal               the NSF funds.",
