 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of                     eucaryotic gene regulation.  The system chosen for study is the                 yeast transcriptional activator ADR1 in its control of glucose                  repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2).  Particular emphasis                  will be placed on defining the mechanisms by which ADR1 is                      regulated, the functional regions of ADR1, the factors which                    mediate or influence ADR1 function, and the means by which these                factors and ADR control ADH2 transcription.  A combination of                   biochemical, recombinant DNA, and genetic analyses will be used.                The in vivo phosphorylation site of ADR1 will be identified and                 the role of cAMP-dependent (cAPK) and -independent protein                      kinases in ADR1 regulation will be ascertained.  The mechanisms                 by which ADR1 will be identified.  The ADR1 protein will be                     isolated and its regions important to transcriptional activation,               regulation of glycerol growth, oligomerization, glucose control,                and induction of petites will be identified.  The proteins which                bind to or mediate ADR1 action will be studied biochemically and                genetically.  The SAF1-3 genes required for ADR1 activation of                  ADH2 transcription will be cloned and sequenced.  The role of the               CCR1 and SCH9 protein kinases which act independently of ADR1                   controlling ADH2 will also be determined.",
