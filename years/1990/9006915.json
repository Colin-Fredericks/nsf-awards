The Johns Hopkins University has announced the closing of its                   Chesapeake Bay Institute in December 1991.  The R/V RIDGELY                     WARFIELD, a 106 foot shallow draft catamaran, has been operated                 by the Chesapeake Bay Institute since it was built with National                Science Foundation funds in 1967.  The relocation of the R/V                    RIDGELY WARFIELD at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory,                       Solomons Island, MD will provide a new, mid-Bay, central site on                the western shore from which to launch scientific investigations.                                                                                               CEES, the environmental sciences research arm of the University                 of Maryland System, is a multi-laboratory institution with                      internationally recognized expertise in oceanography and                        estuarine ecology.  CEES and other institutions of the University               of Maryland System have been major users of the RIDGELY WARFIELD.                                                                                               The director of the project is Dr. Douglas G. Capone, Professor,                Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.  Oversight of ship operations                 will be the cooperative responsibility of a newly formed                        Chesapeake Region Oceanographic Consortium composed of the                      University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine                   Studies, the Academy of Natural Sciences Benedict Estuarine                     Research Laboratory, Hampton University, Old Dominion University,               The Smithsonian Institution, The University of Maryland Eastern                 Shore, The University of Maryland System, and the Virginia                      Institute of Marine Science.",
