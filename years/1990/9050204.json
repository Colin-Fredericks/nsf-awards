 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to develop, test, and prepare for dissemination        curricular materials to encourage active and comprehensive student              learning in geography in grades 6-12.  These materials will build on the        structure used for the videotapes on \"Global Geography\", produced and           disseminated by the Agency for Instructional Technology.  That structure        is based on major geographic themes and concepts that are keyed to              important global issues.  The project will engage nationally-known              geographers, educators, and outstanding classroom teachers in a major           program to develop materials that are inquiry-based, issue-oriented, and        based on specific data.  They will build critical thinking skills and           address attitudes and values.  They will reinforce the widely adopted           \"five fundamental themes\" in geography and will encourage and facilitate        learning a variety of geographic skills.  The project will test the             materials locally in Colorado classrooms and nationally through the             network of state-based geographic alliances supported by the National           Geographic Society.  The materials will be relevant for use throughout          the U.S. and in a variety of community settings.",
