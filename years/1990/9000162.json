 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rich animal communities fueled by carbon producing                         microorganisms are known from a variety of reducing habitats at                 the deep-sea floor including vents, seeps, and organic-rich                     sediments; these habitats generally are linked to the boundaries                between plates and/or areas of high  coastal productivity. During               a recent dive with the submersible, ALVIN, in the Catalina Basin,               scientists discovered a  community fueled by a novel source of                  reduced carbon compounds --- the skeleton of a 20-m long whale.                 Preliminary evidence suggests that whale remains may provide                    persistent and abundant reducing habitats with faunal communities               similar to those of seeps, vents and organic-rich muds.  However,               the significance of whale-skeleton reducing habitats cannot be                  rigorously evaluated without much better knowledge of at least:                 (1) the source and flux rates of reducing compounds, (2)                        community composition (including vent-seep affinities), and (3)                 community dynamics (e.g., persistence times) associated with                    these carbon rich microbial systems. This research will provide a               descriptive and experimental program, using the Catalina Basin                  whale-fall as a case study, to address these three topics.",
