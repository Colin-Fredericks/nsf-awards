 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to explore the feasibility of developing                    a sensitive miniature differential thermometric biosensor                       device using thin polymer films (polyvinylidene fluoride or                     PVDF) displaying a pyroelectric response.  By utilizing such                    techniques as photolithographic etching, electrochemical                        polymerization and microprocessor based data acquisition and                    analysis, the principal investigator anticipates                                constructing and evaluating a simple enzyme and                                 immunochemical based biosensor device which is sensitive,                       quantitative and incorporating low cost fabrication                             techniques.  A distinct advantage of a thermometric                             biosensor device is that a wide variety of analyses can be                      performed and the specificity determined by the choice of                       biological processes without the potential of interferences                     encountered by methods such as spectrophotometry or                             fluorometry.  Further, unlike calorimetric techniques using                     thermistors or thermopiles, pyroelectric films can be                           fabricated to extremely close physical tolerances by simple                     means and operated in a differential mode, irrespective of                      the absolute temperature.  In effect, it is proposed to                         evaluate techniques that can significantly improve upon and                     simplify the classical methods of thermometry and                               microcalorimetry.",
