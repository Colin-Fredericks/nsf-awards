 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Arthur Upgren will continue a program of measuring parallaxes               and proper motions of stars with the 61-cm telescope of the Van                 Vleck Observatory.  He will obtain high precision parallaxes and                photometry of stars of the lower main sequence as well as of                    subdwarf stars.  These stars are among the oldest in our Galaxy,                but their parallaxes and distances are not well known.  It is                   expected that Dr. Upgren's observations will allow calibration of               the distance scale of these old stars with much greater precision               than is now available.  Graduate and undergraduate students will                be involved in all aspects of the program.                                                                                                                      Trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars are fewer in number and                lower in precision than is generally perceived.  Beyond the Solar               System, the distances to even the nearest stars are surprisingly                poorly known.  All but a few percent of published parallaxes are                of stars so distant that the parallax method is inapplicable.  Most             parallax determinations are more than twenty years old and thus                 have errors much larger than those possible in recent years, even               with conventional equipment.  Dr. Upgren's program has made use of              the increases made possible in precision in obtaining parallaxes                and proper motions since 1967.  His is one of the two most                      extensive such programs now active.",
