 "awd_abstract_narration": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes a variety of                           glycoproteins, called mannoproteins owing to the high content of                mannose.  These mannoproteins contain both O- and N-linked                      carbohydrate chains, and differences in the structure of the                    carbohydrate component have been found between different                        mannoproteins and between mannoproteins localized to different                  parts of the cell.  The synthesis of mature N-linked chains                     involves initiation of outer chain addition to the core                         precursor, followed by elongation, termination, branching, and                  then maturation by mannosylphosphorylation and alpha 1-3-                       mannosylation.  The objective of this research is to investigate                the enzymology of the termination reaction which regulates                      whether the N-linked chains are of the small or large type.  A                  specific assay will be developed for the terminase activity so                  that it can be measured in the presence of other                                mannosyltransferases in crude extracts.  The terminase will be                  purified by standard procedures, and factors that modulate its                  activity will be studied.                                                                                                                                       Saccharomyces cerevisiae, common baker's yeast, provides a useful               model for studies on eucaryotic development and on the structural               function relationships of the carbohydrate component of                         glycoproteins.  This work will lead to a better understanding of                the developmental role of these compounds.  Yeasts are important                in biotechnology and the results of these studies may form the                  basis for developing new useful types of yeasts.",
