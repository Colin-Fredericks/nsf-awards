This Conference will be held at the Marine               Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, April 20-22,                  1990. The Conference will include four platform sessions, two                   poster sessions, a keynote address and ample opportunity for                    informal discussion of research. There are two general goals of                 this Regional Meeting in bringing together younger investigators                in the field of developmental biology. The first is to expose                   them to important current research in laboratories throughout the               Northeast. The second is to give them a chance to present their                 own work in both formal presentation as well as informal                        discussions. The specific goal of this 1990 meeting is to bring                 together those investigators working on plant development and                   those working on animal development in order to develop a common                language and appreciation of each other's work.",
