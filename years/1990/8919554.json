 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore visual processing of complex displays.               The basic question addressed is whether processing in such                      displays is serial or parallel.  In other words, the research                   asks what determines the extent to which people can grasp or                    apprehend several objects simultaneously (parallel processing),                 as opposed to one object at a time (serial processing).                                                                                                         A necesary prerequisite to exploration of the determinants of                   parallel and serial processing is quantitative methods that will                permit characterization of performance in a particular situation                as parallel or serial.  Development of such methods has proven to               be a difficult task.  Several methods proposed in the past to                   characterize processing mode have been shown to be problematic.                 This research will explore the use of several \"diagnostics\" that                should allow a clear determination of processing mode when they                 are applied simultaneously.                                                                                                                                     The first part of the research will consist of an effort to                     validate the potentially useful diagnostics.  Following this                    validation, the research will turn to exploration of what                       determines whether search is parallel, serial, or perhaps                       something else in between.  One crucial variable is the                         complexity of the stimulus.  Processing should be parallel when                 the subject has an easy task such as locating a single red target               in a background of blue distractors, but what will happen if the                target is defined as red and square, and the background consists                of red circles and blue squares?  Such conjunctively defined                    targets have sometimes been reported to require serial                          processing; if the present research confirms (or refutes) this                  with new and improved diagnostics it will have important                        theoretical repercussions.                                                                                                                                      In addition to stimulus complexity, this research will explore                  the effects of several other factors, such as the distance                      between the elements of a display and the spatial patterns formed               by the elements of a display.  It is important to know about the                effects of these factors for two reasons.  For one, they are of                 practical importance in designing equipment that maximizes                      effective performance when people are interacting with machines.                For another, analysis of these effects will help researchers to                 develop theoretical models of visual processing.",
