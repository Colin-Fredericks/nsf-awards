 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to update the teaching of digital design by having           students face the challenges of complex systems from their first                exposure to the subject.  The greatest challenge of modern computer             design is trying to manage complexity in a quick and reliable fashion.          Modern hardware design is dominated by tools that extend the designer's         capabilities in synthesis, simulation, and test.  Teaching digital              design, even its basics, without exploring both classical principles            and contemporary methods is anachronistic.                                                                                                                      This project will add proper test instrumentation for system analysis           to an undergraduate digital laboratory that already includes computer           design and simulation tools.  The proposal requests funds to help               purchase six low-end logic analyzers, and one more capable analyzer,            all with printers.  Such instruments are the only proper tool for               analyzing and debugging anything beyond trivial circuits running a slow         speeds.  The logic analyzers will not only be used to support project           design, but will for the basis for a series of lecture demonstrations           and lab assignments that will be documented and available to other              institutions.",
