 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project is to do research characterized as                       urgent with regard to the availability of or access to data,                    facilities, and specialized equipment.  Specifically, Stanford                  University take advantage of and build on research recently                     performed by the Research Assistant on this proposal, Ms. Vera                  Saliba-Pruznick.  As a blind computer scientist, she has both a                 special interest and a special competence for the research.                     The area of research is the use of small computers as                           productivity aids for individuals with disabilities.                                 The research begins from a program to teach students both                  Braille and typing in Braille on a Brailler keyboard,                           originally developed by the project Research Assistant during                   her tenure in the NSF-funded Research Experiences for                           Undergraduates (REU) program at the Sand Diego Supercomputer                    Center in 1989.  At that time, Ms. Saliba-Proznick was a senior                 majoring in Computer Science at the University of California,                   San Diego.                                                                           In the REU program, Ms. Saliba-Pruznick took on the                        problem of the Blind computer programmer as a subject for                       research.  She investigated aids currently available for the                    blind and visually handicapped.  Most of these, she found,                      require speech synthesizers and relied on sound, rather than                    touch.                                                                               She wrote a program for the IBM PC that would teach                        students to use the home keys of the PC keyboard as though they                 were the keys of a Braille typewriter.  The program can be use                  by a blind student with the help of either a human reader or a                  speech synthesizer.  Ms. Saliba-Pruznick will continue her                      research by further developing the program, testing it in a k-                  12 school environment, and publishing the results as widely as                  possible in order to stimulate further research on uses of                      computers as productivity aids for individuals with various                     disabilities.                                                                        The work to be accomplished include:                                       1.  Add quizzes for Grade 2 Braille, not yet incorporated                       2.  Develop printed and Braille instructional material and                      documentation for schoolteacher, student, and sighted helper.                   3.  Generalize the program by making it portable to different                   computers, in addition to the IBM PC, that are frequently found                 in school classrooms.  These platforms might include the Apple                  IIe, the Macintosh, and Commodors/Amigas.      Additional                       research would include gathering further information about                      computer aids for the disabled, with specific reference to                      blind children.",
