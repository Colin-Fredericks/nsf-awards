 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of all plants have seeds modified for                    dispersal, movement away from the parent plant.  The pattern of                 seed dispersal has the potential to affect both the survival of                 individual plants and characteristics of plant populations.                     Since plants are immobile once rooted, the quality of the site                  into which a plant is dispersed as a seed has a major effect on                 its survival.  Patterns of seed dispersal also affect the spatial               arrangement of genetically related individuals.  This spatial                   genetic structure has important consequences for the plant                      population.                                                                          The investigators will document the effects of seed                        dispersal on plant fate and population genetic structure by                     following the movement and subsequent survival of seeds in                      natural populations, using the dispersal of seeds of the native                 wildflower, Trillium grandiflorum, by ants as a model system.                   Seeds will be marked with a radio label that will allow them to                 be relocated after dispersal by ants or other animals.  The                     survival and growth of plants resulting from dispersed and                      undispersed seeds will be followed for 3 years.  The genetic                    identity of plants will be determined using electrophoresis.  In                order to document the role of dispersal in the development of                   spatial genetic structure, the genetic structure of the study                   population will be determined at four stages of the plant life                  cycle:  undispersed seeds, dispersed seeds, seedlings, and adult                plants.                                                                              The results of this study will be of a value to conservation               biologists  involved in the preservation or restoration of                      plants in their natural habitats.  An understanding of the                      effects of seed dispersal on plant survival is critical to such                 efforts.  This study will also explore the importance of seed                   dispersal by animals in the development of population genetic                   structure and in the maintenance of population genetic diversity,               two factors that may be important in the long-term conservation                 of viable populations.",
