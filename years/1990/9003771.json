The thrust of this project is to study the earthquake                           effect on masonry and masonry veneer buildings based on                         analysis and damage observations.                                                                                                                               The overall objective of this project is to improve the                         seismic safety of masonry and masonry veneer buildings in                       the United States.  Its specific objective is to evaluate                       the seismic performance of masonry and masonry veneer                           buildings in the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, with                                                                                                      particular attention to the behavior of selected                                buildings.                                                                                                                                                      The following task will be undertaken:  l) review                               the overall behavior of masonry and masonry                                     veneer buildings; 2) select a small number (3-5) of                             such buildings for further study, based on their                                usefulness as prototypes, and on the availability of                            strong-motion records, 3) study their damages in detail,                        and compare their responses with that predicted                                 analytically; and 4) using this comparison, assess the                          effectiveness of existing masonry design codes, estimate                        the probable hazard of existing masonry buildings, and                          provide useful information to those concerned with the                          repair and retrofit of masonry buildings.                                                                                                                       This study will lead to an improved understanding of the                        seismic damage to masonry and masonry veneer buildings and                                                                                                      the development of practical ways to mitigate such future                       damage to such existing buildings in seismic hazard areas.",
