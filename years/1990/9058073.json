 "awd_abstract_narration": "A broad range of chemical process engineering problems                     including systematic process design, retrofit design, batch                     scheduling, production planning, facility layout, and plant startup             may be naturally modeled as mixed integer nonlinear programs                    (MINLP).  Although a large number of models have been published                 for a variety of specific situations, practical application of                  MINLP methods has been limited because conventional solution                    techniques are effective only on models of limited size.  An                    important goal of this long term research program is the                        development of highly parallel algorithms for solving MINLP.  In                particular, this research seeks to be able to use hundreds of                   powerful processors to substantially extend the range of                        tractability for MINLP.  The dramatic increase in solution                      capability is critical in incorporating multiple objectives,                    realistic physics, flexibility, and robustness into engineering                 design and operation models.  Three important issues that must be               addressed in the course of developing effective parallel MINLP                  algorithms are: (1) the systematic  exploitation of problem                     structure (2) the partitioning of the workload among processors and             (3) the utilization of concurrently available information to                    improve algorithm performance.  Central to understanding these                  issues is the development of special purpose parallel algorithm                 performance.  Central to understanding these issues is the                      development of special purpose parallel algorithms for highly                   structured integer programs.                                                         Research will proceed along two complementary paths: (1)                   development of general purpose parallel MINLP algorithms (2)                    development of special purpose parallel algorithms for highly                   structured integer programs.  The underlying goal of both paths is              to learn how to effectively use massive amounts of parallelism                  while at the same time exploiting problem specific features.",
