 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical controls for most devices are either \"one size fits all\"               or require custom hardware for each user.  Cost often prohibits                 custom design, and each user must adapt to the standard device                  interface, typically with a loss of precision and efficiency.                   When user abilities vary widely, such as in the disabled                        community, devices often become unusable.  The goal is to create                a system that will track user gestures and interpret them as                    control signals for devices.  Existing gesture recognition                      research converts continuous body motion into discrete signals.                 The approach is to map continuous motions into a set of analog                  device control signals.  The system will allow us to quickly                    tailor a device interface to each user's best physical range of                 motion.  The first application domain is a speech synthesizer for               disabled users.  Results are expected in two major areas of                     applicability for non-disabled users:  in telemanipulator                       interfaces, and as a design tool for creating biomechanically                   efficient interfaces.",
