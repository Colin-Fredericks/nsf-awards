 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kraus will investigate some questions concerning                 tensor products and approximation properties of weakly closed                   subspaces of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space,               and some similar questions for operator spaces.  In particular,                 he will investigate the problem of whether all CSL algebras have                a certain weak approximation property which guarantees that the                 algebras behave well under tensoring.  Other projects involve the               study of the class of groups whose associated von Neumann                       algebras have this approximation property, and the study of other               related approximation properties.                                                    This project involves the study of operators on Hilbert                    spaces.  Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite                       matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have applications                 in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.                This research is an attempt to understand how algebras of these                 operators acting on independent Hilbert spaces behave when they                 are combined by taking the tensor product of these spaces.",
