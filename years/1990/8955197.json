 "awd_abstract_narration": "During this two year project, teachers of grades 5-9 will                       participate in two-week basic level workshops (Years I and                      II - 40 teachers each year) and an advanced three-week                          workshop (Year II-10 teachers) at and near Mount St. Helen's                    National Volcanic Monument.                                                                                                                                     Instruction in science content will be offered by leading                       scientists.  Content will be presented in exemplary                             lecture/discussion format, model hands-on classroom                             activities and well-designed, relevant investigative field                      experiences.  Science content needs will be integrated with                     teaching strategies and materials development.                                                                                                                  Level I Workshops beginning in the summer of 1990 will                          consist of 10 days of classroom instruction alternating with                    and reinforced by four days of on-site field observation and                    study.  Classroom days will be divided equally between                          instruction in science topics and in instructional methods                      appropriate to the target grade levels.  Level II Workshops                     will add advanced work in building-level implementation                         through a peer-coaching model, and introduction to videodisc                    curriculum technology.                                                                                                                                          Science topics will be taught in lecture, seminar, small                        group and laboratory formats.  Methods instruction will                         emphasize effective classroom and field-study strategies.                       Participants will spend part of each day developing teaching                    methods that will be pilot-tested in peer-teaching situation.                                                                                                   Priority will be given applicants 1) able to attend in teams                    of two or more, 2) underprepared for their assignments in                       terms of science content and science-instruction methods, 3)                    able to provide evidence of ongoing administrative support                      for implementation at the home-site, and 4) responsible for                     teaching selected at-risk populations.  Participants may earn                   up to eight quarter hours of graduate credit.
