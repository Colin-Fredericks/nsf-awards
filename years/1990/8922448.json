 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in genetics                      between Dr. Jeffrey Bennetzen, Purdue University, and two                       British plant biologists:  Dr. Michael Bevan, AFRC Institute                    of Plant Science Research, Cambridge, and Dr. Jonathan Jones,                   Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich.                                                                                                                                  The maize transposable element Ac has been introduced into                      tomato plants.  These transgenic plants support subsequent                      excision of the Ac element and its movement to new chromosomal                  sites within the tomato genome.  The Ac element introduced                      into the tomato plants interrupts an antibiotic resistance                      gene, and plants with newly excised/transposed Ac elements can                  be identified via their acquired antibiotic resistance.  In                     collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Jones' laboratory, whose                        researchers generated these materials, the principal                            investigator will employ restriction fragment length                            polymorphism (RFLP) technology to map original and transposed                   Ac elements in transgenic tomatoes.  These studies will                         determine the insertion specificity of Ac in tomato and will                    establish a catalogue of lines with Ac elements at linked and                   unlinked chromosomal sites.  Depending upon the status of                       currently ongoing studies in transformation of wheat and                        barley at Dr. Michael Bevan's laboratory in Norwich and of                      maize, sorghum and millet in Dr. Bennetzen's laboratory, the                    investigators also propose to introduce these engineered Ac                     elements into one or more of these important crop species.                      The materials generated will allow future research programs                     in transposon biology, mutagenesis and tagging in these                         plant species. The proposed research is timely and very                         important for further development of methods of isolating                       agronomically relevant genes from economically important                        plants. The project will benefit from the complementary                         expertise of the investigators in the area of gene expression                   in transgenic plants.",
