 "awd_abstract_narration": "ISI, in the person of Bob Braden, propose to develop and engineer               transport protocols to facilitate advanced applications over the                Internet.                                                                            One task is to experiment with a wide-area multicast                       protocol using the facilities of a DARPA-provided gateway.                      Multicast is not currently used in the Internet, but its                        implementation could significantly reduce the traffic generated                 by such applications as network news, bulletin boards, and                      mailing lists.  A second early task is to test the suitability of               two new transport protocols (VMTP, due to Cheriton, and Rx) in                  place of the customary TCP and UDP as support for higher level                  transaction-based protocols.  Availability of transaction                       protocols on the Internet would allow atomic operations to be                   communicated over the Internet with a sequence of datagrams.                         In the second year of the project, the interaction of                      transport protocols and gateway dynamics (as affected by resource               allocation algorithms and queue disciplines) will be                            investigated.                                                                        Subsidiary tasks include bug fixes and maintenance releases                of NNStat/statspy, a widely-used network monitoring package                     originally developed by the PI (and others at ISI).  Funds are                  also provided for Braden to continue to act as Executive Director               of the Internet Activities Board (IAB), and to chair the                        End-to-End Task Force of the IAB.",
