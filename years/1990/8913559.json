 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing destruction and fragmentation of forests               in both the tropical and temperate regions of the western                       hemisphere, the need to understand the impact of these changes on               the total ecosystem is urgent.  Neotropical migrant landbirds are               particularly susceptible to these alterations because of their                  migratory habits.  For these species, survival depends on                       suitable habitat in both regions.  This dependence is manifested                in a complex ecology that incorporates spatially separate and                   often physiognomically different habitats.  This symposium will                 bring together an international group of scientists with diverse                expertise in research on migrant landbird ecology, but who have a               common goal of species and habitat conservation.  The goal is to                understand the ecology of this diverse group in light of their                  international migratory habits, so that avian biodiversity can be               maintained and so endangered status can be averted or                           forestalled.  Essential to the success of this meeting will be                  participation by Latin American researchers who study these                     species in their \"wintering\" habitats.  Documenting population                  trends in migrant landbirds, and establishing causes of such                    change, are both formidable tasks.  However, this knowledge will                be of limited value without participation of Latin American                     scientists who bear the direct responsibility of taking                         conservation action in their countries.  Interaction between                    North and Latin American scientists at this conference will                     provide a perspective that otherwise would not be possible, it is               difficult for North American scientists to appreciate the                       socioeconomic realities of conservation action in Latin America.                Latin American contingent at this meeting is essential for                      understanding of neotropical migrant landbird ecology, and in                   helping to establish a realistic international conservation                     agenda.",
