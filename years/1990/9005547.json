 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chloroplast enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate                                carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes the rate-limiting step                of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, and thus limits plant                           productivity.  Oxygenation of substrate ribulosebisphosphate                    leads to the loss of fixed carbon, and the competition of O2 with               CO2 at the enzyme active site reduces the maximum rate of                       carboxylation.  Genetic engineering is expected to improve                      carboxylation by changing the CO2/O2 specificity of the enzyme.                 However, there has been no rationale for accomplishing this goal.               Directed mutagenesis has so far been limited to confirming the                  essential role of a variety of \"active-site\" residues, and the                  Rubisco primary and x-ray-crystal structures have failed to                     identify potential sites for beneficial modification.  In                       contrast, the neoclassical genetic approach that can be pursued                 in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been able to                    define structural regions of the chloroplast-encoded large                      subunit that influence the CO2/O2 specificity of the holoenzyme.                A more methodical approach for the application of induced                       mutations is underway.  Mutations are being defined by sequencing               appropriate chloroplast or nuclear genes, and mutant enzymes are                being characterized biochemically to correlate changes in                       structure with changes in function.  Directed mutagenesis and                   chloroplast transformation are also being used to test hypotheses               formulated from the study of these mutations.                                                                                                                   The photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco is present in all green plants                and algae and is considered to be the most abundant protein in                  nature.  Since it catalyzes a reaction which can limit                          photosynthetic CO2 fixation and, therefore, plant growth, the                   long-term objective of this work is to make a better Rubisco.                   Since the primary structure of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii                    Rubisco is quite similar to that of plants, it is a good model                  for defining potential modifications in crop-plant Rubisco                      enzymes.",
