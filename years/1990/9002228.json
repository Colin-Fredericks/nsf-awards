 "awd_abstract_narration": "A general-purpose tool for computing and visualizing solutions to               systems of algebraic equations shall be built.  Diverse algorithms              exist for this problem and related sub-problems.  The goal of this              project is also to develop a new set of solution techniques based on            multi-polynomial resultants.  Our designed tool shall be portable and           allow rapid prototyping of new and existing algorithms, in an                   intelligent blend of algebraic and numeric methods and real                     solutions.  Complex solutions can also be computed, but visualizing             them is difficult. The software shall also take advantage of any                parallel hardware that is present.  In all, a substantial improvement           is anticipated in the state of the art of algebraic equation solving.           Overall, the approach is to devise novel algorithmic techniques, blend          with existing methods as well as compare the relative efficacy of the           various methods.                                                                                                                                                A prototype system implementing some of these goals is built and                evolving.  It is written in Common Lisp and C, and runs under the               version 11 of the X window system.  The system is portable to any               machine that runs vanilla Common Lisp, supports the X window system,            and has at least a rudimentary Lisp/C interface.  At the present time           it can solve systems of up to two equations in any number of                    variables.  Example applications of this are curve and surface                  display, curve-curve intersections, or surface surface intersections.           A graphical user interface allows the display and manipulation of OD            (points), 1D (curves) or 2D (surface) solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   //",
