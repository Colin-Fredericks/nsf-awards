 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will enhance participant's content                        background and laboratory skills by incorporating the                           theories of physics and chemistry with applications. Teachers                   will be involved in hands-on activities which can easily be                     implemented in their classes.                                                   The project design includes both a summer workshop at Eastern                   Oregon State University and an academic year component                          delivered at different sites in eastern Oregon using a mobile                   classroom.                                                                                                                                                      The summer workshop will have the following format.  Twenty                     teachers, (K-3 grades will be accepted in a three-week                          workshop.  Following this, there will be an additional three-                   week workshop with twenty teachers (4-6 grades).  In each                       workshop, one or two principals will be involved.  The format                   of the workshops will be a session of physics theory and                        another session of chemistry theory in the morning.  These                      sessions will be fundamental in nature and the participants                     will be furnished textbooks of similar level.  Each session                     will be 1 1/2 hours in length with a short break between                        them.  Next is a break for lunch, after which, a three hour                     session of hands-on activities or experiments for the                           teachers.  The design of these activities will closely follow                   the theory lectures presented in the morning sessions.  Only                    on Wednesday afternoon will the participants have an                            unstructured schedule to create their own activity, work in                     the curriculum library, or read.                                                                                                                                An unusual feature of this project is the mobile classroom. A                   science specialist will coordinate a meeting schedule with                      the school districts.  She will travel with the mobile                          classroom to provide inservice, during the academic year to                     teacher located at selected locations in eastern Oregon.                        Fully equipped for science instruction, this unit will arrive                   ready for teachers to participate in hands-on science                           activities during inservice sessions.  These sites will be                      visited six times a year.  The inservice will keep the                          teachers current, resolve problems stemming from unanswered                     questions from inquisitive students, and confront the teacher                   with a constant reminder of using science activities in the                     classroom.  Mobile classroom science activities are                             plannedfor immediate implementation at the appropriate grade                    level as the teacher's school.  Theory will be presented                        inconjunction with the hands-on segment in each case.                                                                                                           Six credits will be offered for the summer workshop and one                     credit will be offered for the mobile classroom inservice                       sessions.  Cost sharing in the amount of $127,924 equals                        33%of the NSF award.",
