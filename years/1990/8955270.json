 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SUNY College at Brockport three-year program to integrate             real-world applications into the mathematics curriculum of the secondary        schools in New York.  In each of two summers, fifteen teams of two              teachers each will participate in a four-week workshop with project             staff and industry representatives to become acquainted with a wide             range of applications.  The teams will prepare materials for their own          use, then share their materials and experiences with colleagues in in-          service workshops and with students in class.  The total number of              participating teachers is sixty.  Much of the project will center around        the new twelfth grade precalculus course under development by the New           York State Education Department.  The recently revised three-year               integrated sequence for 9-11 will provide a secondary focus of effort.          A strong effort to ensure participation by under-represented groups is          included.  Suny Brockport, the sixty participating districts, and the           New York State Education Department will contribute an amount equal to          88% of the National Science Foundation request.",
