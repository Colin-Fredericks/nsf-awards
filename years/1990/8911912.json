 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies in the areas of protein trafficking, growth                      factors, and tumor growth have suggestd an important link between               lysosomal enzyme secretion and cell growth.  As a long term                     approach toward understanding this link, this laboratory has been               examining lysosomal protein trafficking and function in mouse 3T3               fibroblasts.  Previous studies have shown that synthesis and                    secretion of lysosomal, mannose 6-phosphate-containing proteins                 are regulated in these cells under various conditions of cell                   growth.  These proteins include \"MEP\", the major excreted protein               of transformed fibroblast cell lines, and proliferin, the major                 serum-induced protein secreted by untransformed fibroblasts.  On                the basis of their patterns of regulation, it appears likely that               extracellular forms of these proteins play important roles in the               process of normal cell growth.  These proteins may participate                  directly in the growth process by acting as autocrine or                        paracrine growth factors, or indirectly through modification of                 cell surface receptors or components of the extracellular matrix.               The proposed studies will involve characterization of the                       synthesis and trafficking of proliferin, and examination of the                 function of MEP and proliferin as growth regulators or modifiers                of the extracellular matrix.  Functional studies will involve the               use of antisense RNAs and other inhibitors to inactivate MEP and                proliferin in growing cells.                                                                                                                                    The results of these studies should increase our understanding of               how and why lysosomal trafficking is regulated during cellular                  growth, and, in turn, how lysosomal proteins released from cells                may be involved in cell growth regulation.",
