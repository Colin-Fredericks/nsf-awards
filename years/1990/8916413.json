 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most active areas of current research in endocrinology               is the role that a cardiac peptide hormone (atriopeptide) plays                 in the control of mammalian body fluid volume and blood pressure,               because of the obvious interest in the control of hypertension.                 Recent studies in the principal investigator's laboratory, and                  others, indicates that a similar hormone is produced in both the                atria and ventricles of the hearts of various fish groups, and                  may play a role in the chronic volume and salt problems that                    these aquatic vertebrates face.   The research involves                         isolation, sequencing, and synthesizing the cardiac atriopeptin                 from one species of teleost fish.  This will enable development                 of antibodies to the peptide to be used in determination of the                 concentration of the hormone in the plasma of various fish                      species via radioimmunoassay, as well as distribution of the                    hormone in the heart and brain via immunohistochemistry.                        Radioactive hormone will be used to quantify the presence and                   binding kinetics of receptors to atriopeptin in various tissues                 such as the gills, gut, and kidney.  Antibodies to the hormone                  will also be utilized to bind to, and thereby inactivate,                       atriopeptin in the plasma, to investigate the role of the hormone               in volume and salt regulation.  It is also planned to use cardiac               tissue culture to determine the role of various agents (other                   hormones and salt or volume changes) in  stimulation of the                     secretion of atriopeptin.  The studies are intended to provide                  information on the evolution of the structure and function of                   this newly described cardiac peptide hormone.",
