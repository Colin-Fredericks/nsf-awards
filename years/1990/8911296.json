 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years, society has treated the atmosphere as an                   infinite reservoir for diluting emissions from our factories                    and automobiles.  we now know that sulfur and nitrogen oxide                    emissions have resulted in the phenomenon of acid rain, which                   is detrimental to plant and animal life as well as some                         building materials.  Atmospheric chemists are engaged in                        studies of the processes by which these compounds are oxidized                  to sulfuric and nitric acids.  such chemical information is                     necessary if we are ever to predict, for example, the                           geographical pattern of acidity reduction which would result                    from diminished emissions.                                                           This project focuses on hydrogen peroxide, which has been                  identified as a key oxidant for dissolved sulfur dioxide.                       Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide is believed to originate from                     hydroperoxyl and superoxide radicals.  The production of                        hydrogen peroxide has been studied in the laboratory by                         observing the disappearance of the free radicals at relatively                  high concentration in carefully purified solutions.  In this                    project, cobalt-60 radiation will be used to generate the                       radicals in cloudwater at levels characteristic of the ambient                  atmosphere.  Samples will then be analyzed for the                              concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the rate of its                          formation in the presence and absence of common atmospheric                     contaminants.  The experiments will help establish the                          appropriate reaction rates to use in models incorporating                       aqueous atmospheric processes.",
