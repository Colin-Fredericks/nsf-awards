 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pheromones are a chemical substance produced by one individual                  that conveys information to other individuals of the same                       species.  This form of chemical communication can evoke neural                  effects that produce immediate behavioral responses or act                      through the endocrine and reproductive systems to cause delayed                 physiological responses.  While much of this work has been                      carried out using invertebrates, pheromones are important signals               in other species, including humans.  Dr. Houck has generated a                  wealth of information about the behavioral/social changes in                    females exposed to pheromones released by males.  With this                     Career Advancement Award, she will extend her behavioral work by                determining how individual cells in the brain respond to these                  pheromones.  By learning sophisticated neurophysiological                       techniques, Dr. Houck will examine the mechanisms by which                      natural odors are perceived and determine whether pheromones                    released from certain individuals are more effective in eliciting               a physiological response from females.  Her approach combines the               study of physiological reactions with an evolution interpretation               of chemical cues that affect behavioral responses.  Pheromonal                  research is playing an important role in the noninvasive control                of various pest populations that destroy crops in America.  In                  addition, advances made by these types of studies are being used                to identify the subtle cues signalling the approach of ovulation                in domestic stock, thus allowing more precise timing of                         artificial insemination, resulting in greatly increased breeding                efficiency.",
