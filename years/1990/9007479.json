 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plants compete for resources:  competition has been                   shown to limit growth in both agricultural and naturally-                       occurring plants. Many studies have investigated the importance                 of competition (e.g. yield-density relationships, effects of                    weeds on crops).  However, very little is known about the                       evolutionary importance of competition.  To what degree has                     competition been important in the evolution of plant morphology,                physiology, and phenology?  There are four evolutionary                         alternatives or outcomes for competing plants:  resource                        partitioning, increased uptake of resources, increased efficiency               of resource use, and interference mechanisms.  The investigator                 has predicted which alternative is most likely to occur in                      different types of competitive environments.                                         The proposed research directly follows the evolution of                    plants in different competitive environments.  Brassica rapa L.                 will be grown at high densities for ten discrete generations.                   Environments will differ in the presence and absence of                         interspecific competitors and fertilizer.  Each generation, the                 largest 20% of the individuals  will be selected to be pollinated               and to provide seed for the next generation.  The investigator                  will monitor competitive characteristics of individuals of each                 generation for changes in plant performance and traits.  The                    results will demonstrate which of the four evolutionary                         alternatives are most likely to occur in different conditions.",
