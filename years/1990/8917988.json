 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of the shallow oceanic crust produced at seafloor                    spreading centers is poorly constrained by available geophysical                data. Recent studies suggest that the shallowest layers of the                  crust are characterized by extremely low seismic velocities, but                that the velocity increases rapidly with depth. Understanding the               processes that control these variations are important in                        determining the porosity of the crust, alteration of crustal                    rock, and the local and regional significance of crustal drilling               data.                                                                                                                                                           The present award will support Dr. Fryer's participation in a                   near bottom refraction study of a segment of the East Pacific                   Rise in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The project will allow a                detailed study of the shallow crust by using both a receiver and                acoustic source deployed at the seafloor. This technique will                   provide a higher resolution study than is available from normal                 surface ship observations. Dr. Purdy of Woods Hole has                          responsibility for obtaining the field data. Dr. Fryer will be                  involved in analysis of the data from the experiment which will                 be compared to drilling results planned along this same section                 of ridge. The principal investigators on this project have                      distinguished records in both experimental and theoretical                      analysis of crustal data.",
