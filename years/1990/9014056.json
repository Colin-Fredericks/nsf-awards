 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Mathematics Programs of the University                        of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras and Mayaguez has had a                            tremendous research upsurge in recent times.  For example,                      the Rio Piedras Mathematics Department has moved from                           being in 1984 in the last position in number of                                 publications per researcher of all the Departments of the                       Faculty of Natural Sciences in Rio Piedras, to being in                         1988 in the second position of all Science Department of                        the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico in such                           number of publication.  Also the Research Funds have                            increased 13 times from $100,000 for the period 1974-84 to                      $1,300,000 for the period 1984-1989.  Further a new BA in                       Computer Science has been approved by the academic senate                       to be included as one of the options we offer.                                                                                                                  The main objective of the present proposal is to further                        raise the competitive level of our Department through a                         program of collaborative research with highly competitive                       mainland researchers.  On the other hand we intend to                           increase minority participation in research through a                           local collaborative program of research with our four year                      colleges.                                                                                                                                                       Last, the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras and                            Mayaguez Campus, will expand the Mathematics Graduate                           Program to include a joint doctorate in Computational                           Mathematics.  It will carry this out via a collection of                        coopering institutions, from the local to the national                          level.  With the cooperative assistance of national                             research institutions, this program will train faculty and                      professionals to serve the needs of local and national                          colleges and industry, and will greatly expand their                            growth potential in Puerto Rico along new lines.",
