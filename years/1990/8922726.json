 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in aquatic                       ecosystems between Dr. Roy Stein, Ohio State University and                     Dr. Christer Bronmark, University of Lund, Sweden.  The                         objective of the proposed project is an examination and                         evaluation of interactions among fish predators which affect                    the \u001astructurally.complex environment of natural ponds.                                                                                                         Dr. Stein is currently carrying out a large scale experiment                    in the northern Wisconsin lakes to study the role of predators                  in structuring nearshore communities.  Using laboratory                         experiments, lake surveys and a large.scale inshore mesocosm                    experiment (where portions of the nearshore are enclosed by a                   curtain), the Wisconsin research team is exploring how                          biotic and abiotic factors influence all facets of the                          littoral community, including  predatory fishes, crayfish,                      snails, periphyton and macrophytes. Because of the abundance                    of small ponds near Lund, Sweden with piscivorous and                           benthivorous fishes, snails, periphyton and macrophytes,                        whole.system manipulations of predators can be done without                     resorting to the use of large enclosures.  In contrast to the                   Wisconsin work, the work proposed for Sweden, which includes                    a pond survey (to qualify field patterns) and predator                          manipulations (where northern pike and tench densities are                      treatment variables), will evaluate in a more extensive                         fashion how fish predators interact to directly and indirectly                  influence snails, periphyton, and macrophytes in natural                        ponds.  This work will directly test the trophic cascade                        hypothesis, recently applied to the pelagia of lakes, but                       largely untested in the structurally.complex environment of                     the benthic, littoral community. The project will benefit                       from the complementary expertise of the two investigators.                      Dr. Bronmark has extensive experience with interactions among                   snails, periphyton and macrophytes. Dr. Stein's expertise                       lies in quantifying the behavioral interactions between fish                    predators and their prey and how these interactions might be                    mediated by habitat structure.",
