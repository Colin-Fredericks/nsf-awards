As part of the National                                     Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)                                     various Federal, state and regional programs                                    have been carried out in past years to promote                                  the implementation of local-level earthquake                                    preparedness and loss reduction activities.                                     The Loma Prieta earthquake provides the                                         opportunity to examine the specific lessons                                     local agency staff have learned through having                                  their preparedness plans and loss reduction                                     programs tested by a major earthquake in the                                    region.  Agency staff selected from                                             approximately 35 jurisdictions in seven Bay                                     region counties will be asked whether their                                     mitigation efforts were effective or were                                       likely to be effective in future earthquakes,                                   whether the earthquake has caused them to                                       change their pre-quake programs and plans, and                                  what information sources and program guidance                                   they now think are the most useful.
