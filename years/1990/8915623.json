 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in galactic astronomy            between Dr. Trinh Thuan, University of Virginia and Dr. Rene                    Pellat and Jean-Michel Alimi of the Paris Observatory, Meudon,                  France.  The objective of the proposed research is a study of the               comparative distribution of dwarf and giant galaxies.                                                                                                           The investigators propose to study the spatial distribution of                  dwarf and low-surface brightness galaxies in the northern                       hemisphere, using as the data base a 21 cm redshift survey                      developed by Dr. Thuan of approximately 1800 galaxies classified                as dwarf, magellenic and irregular in the Uppsala General Catalogue             of Galaxies.  These data represent an important new source of                   information on the spatial distribution of intrinsically faint                  galaxies.  Specifically, they will examine the clustering properties            of dwarf galaxies, compared to those of bright galaxies.  They                  also plan to compute other statistics, such as the mean number of               dwarf galaxies associated with a bright galaxy of a given absolute              margin.  This type of statistic is of prime importance for the                  understanding of other astrophysical phenomena.  The results of                 this project may have an important influence on present ideas on                the  \"biassing\" of galaxy formation and the question of whether                 the Universe contain enough dark matter to be closed.  The project              will benefit from the combined expertise of Dr. Thuan in dwarf                  galaxies and the French experience in statistical techniques to                 analyze galaxy clustering.",
