 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oklahoma State University will establish a Research Careers for                 Minority Scholars project to increase the representation of Blacks,             American Indians, and Hispanics in the field of Condensed Matter                Physics.  The project will consist of three mutually supporting                 phases.  (1)  An undergraduate research internship for students in the          summer between their Junior and Senior years.  This will introduce              them to the excitement of a research career on the forefront of                 knowledge.  (2)  A \"bridging summer\" immediately following their                completion of the baccalaureate degree to provide a continuous path             from undergraduate to graduate study, continue their involvement in             research, and give them a head start toward completion of a thesis              problem.  This continuity is important since many U.S. students are             lost to research careers because they enter the job market at the B.S.          level.  (3)  Support for their first year of graduate study including           opportunities for them to serve as role models for minority                     undergraduates.  The project will emphasize research in the properties          of optical materials, an area with great industrial, as well as                 academic, interest.  Oklahoma State University is one of the leading            American research centers in optical materials.  All phases of the              program will provide, through attendance at scientific conferences and          colloquia, the opportunity to interact with the larger scientific               community as well as OSU faculty, staff and students.  This will aid            the Minority Scholars in building their network within the physics              community that is so important in becoming successful and productive            research physicists.  Over the five years covered by this proposal the          program will approximately double the number of students from the               targeted groups who are preparing for research careers in Condensed             Matter Physics.",
