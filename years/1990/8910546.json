A sentence-to-be-spoken                       initially exists as a conceptual representation, then as a series               of linguistic representations, and finally as an articulatory                   representation.  This project addresses the question of the time                course of the construction of these representations, particularly               those linguistic representations associated with the form of                    spoken words and their positions in a syntactic structure.  For                 example, how far in advance of the word currently being spoken                  are upcoming words prepared?  Can one distinguish between the                   selection of upcoming words as abstract lexical items and the                   retrieval of their phonological constituents?  How is this                      advance planning affected by the syntactic and prosodic structure               of the planned utterance?  The investigators address these                      questions by applying to production the priming methodology that                has proved so successful in the study of language comprehension.                In the experiments, subjects prepare to say single words,                       phrases, or sentences.  After this preparation, subjects are                    occasionally presented with a probe word to which they must                     respond in some way (e.g., by naming the probe).  The probes bear               either formal or semantic relations to words in the planned                     utterance, and thus the response times to the related probes                    (compared to unrelated control probes) can index the extent and                 nature of utterance planning.  The investigators also develop and               test an explicit spreading-activation model of form-related                     priming to aid in the interpretation of the data.",
