 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuropeptides are small proteinaceous molecules which are                       involved in a variety of brain roles, ranging from controlling                  movements to transmitting sensory information such as pain.                     These chemicals are also implicated in more long-term behavioral                changes such as learning and memory, arousal and various                        emotional states.  Although much is known about the behavioral                  effects of neuropeptides, relatively little is understood about                 how these neurochemicals cause changes at the cellular and                      molecular levels.  Unfortunately, these sorts of physiological                  studies are not currently feasible in mammals because of                        technical difficulties and that the mammalian brain is                          exceedingly centralized and complex.  To overcome these problems,               Dr. Tublitz has capitalized on relatively simple nervous system                 of invertebrates.  He concentrates on a family of neuropeptides,                the Cardioacceleratory Peptides (CAPs), that modulate several                   different tissues, including the heart, gut and CNS.  Dr. Tublitz               will examine the physiology of individual cells which synthesize                and release the CAPs.  He will examine why the number of                        neuropeptide neurons change during the animal's lifetime.                       Moreover, Dr. Tublitz will determine the molecular mechanisms by                which the CAPs exert the powerful and long-lasting effects upon                 the target tissues.  These investigations, currently possible                   only in simple invertebrate preparations, will likely provide new               and important information about neuropeptide function that will                 be applicable to all species, including humans.  This work will                 lead to a better understanding of how the chemicals in the brain                interact with each other and with the brain's nerve cells to                    modify behavior.",
