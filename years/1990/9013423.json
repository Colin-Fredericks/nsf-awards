 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an attempt to apply new cohomological and                  representation-theoretic ideas to problems in transformation                    groups and homotopy theory.  The particular aspects which it                    involves can be described as follows:  (1) Incorporate the study                of certain discrete groups, such as arithmetic groups and mapping               class groups, to an existing program based on applying methods                  from modular representation theory to group actions.  (2)                       Determine general properties of the cohomology of finite groups,                and how, using equivariant cohomology, this influences the role                 they play as transformation groups.  (3) Obtain necessary and                   sufficient conditions for a finite group to act freely on a                     product of spheres, and analyze the restrictions this imposes on                the homology representations when they are of the same dimension.               This work is aimed at approaching a global conjecture on the free               rank of symmetry of a finite complex.  (4) Use theory of infinite               loop spaces and invariant theory to obtain precise cohomological                information on the symmetric groups, with several applications in               mind.  They include describing the cohomology of certain double                 covers of the symmetric groups which serve as finite models for a               space which detects important characteristic classes.  Other                    applications to stable homotopy and group cohomology are also                   planned.  The invariant theory used is seen as an interesting and               important algebraic problem in its own right, encoding most of                  the cohomological structure of the symmetric groups.                                 In other words, the various parts of this project all                      concern the symmetry of geometric objects.  Algebraic tools for                 making calculations about symmetry will be perfected, and these                 tools will then be applied to answer natural questions.",
