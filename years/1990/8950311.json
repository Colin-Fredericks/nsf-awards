 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of improving school students' mathematical                          understanding is too complex to approach from any one research                  perspective.  Learning, teaching, and curriculum influence each other in        significant ways.  The proposed project will extend a current research          effort in order to investigate the development of students' algebraic           reasoning in grades 5 through 7 as they are taught for three years from         a curriculum infused with instruction emphasizing quantitative                  reasoning.                                                                                                                                                      The project's first year will be devoted to assessing 5th-grade                 students' concepts of quantity and quantitative operations, developing          cognitive objectives of instruction and materials to support                    experimental instruction aimed at achieving those objectives, developing        evaluation instruments and aligning them with experimental instruction,         and instructing classroom teachers on the objectives of teaching for            quantitative reasoning.  The subsequential three years will focus on            effects of instruction on student' quantitative and algebraic reasoning         and effects of teachers' participation on their knowledge of                    mathematical content and pedagogy.  Experimental instruction will               incorporate advanced software and materials developed for research on           teaching and learning quantitative reasoning by use of multiple, linked         representational systems.                                                                                                                                       The proposed study should have a significant impact on research on              mathematics learning, research on mathematics teaching, and research on         curriculum development.",
