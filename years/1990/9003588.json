The aim is to evaluate critical parameters of                                   the Loma Prieta earthquake ground motions                                       (including after shocks) that have                                              engineering significance, and to demonstrate                                    the use of these parameters in predicting the                                   damageability of future Bay Area earthquakes.                                   Information on the duration, time-variation                                     and breadth of frequency content, cyclic                                        history, etc. - motion properties known to                                      have important effects on structural damage,                                    but which are difficult to define and use                                       explicitly - this information is incorporated                                   implicitly in the characterization.                                                                                                                             A comparison is made between the predicted                                      and observed damage-effective motion                                            characteristics for the Loma Prieta                                             earthquake.  The observed analytical                                            characterizations are used to explain                                           specific cases of building damage and non-                                      damage, while the influence of the soil on                                      the motion characterizations is determined                                      statistically.  These data from the Loma                                        Prieta earthquake are combined with data                                        computed for earlier events.                                                                                                                                    The project is expected to result in improved                                   statistical formulas for the                                                    magnitude/distance/soil dependence of                                           nonlinear damageability.  These formulas,                                       when combined with local soils data, are used                                   to conduct probabilistic hazard analyses to                                     derive maps of the damageability of future                                      Bay Area earthquakes.",
