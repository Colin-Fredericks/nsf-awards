 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dudley Herschbach is supported by a Small Grant for                   Exploratory Research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                   Program to study molecular orientation in cold molecular beams                  by the application of strong electric fields. These                             measurements provide a new method to address questions                          concerning the importance of relative orientation between                       reacting molecules and the influence which molecular                            orientation has on chemical reactivity.                                                                                                                         Polar molecules with a three-fold or higher axis of symmetry in                 certain rotational states will precess in an electric field                     rather than tumble.  The dipole moment therefore does not                       average out for such states, so an electric field can exert a                   torque which produces substantial orientation.  Orientation by                  an electric field has been considered quite impractical for                     less symmetrical molecules.  The rotational motion of diatomic,                 linear, or asymmetric top molecules averages out the dipole                     moment in first-order, so the interaction with an electric                      field is much weaker.  Dr. Herschbach has performed feasibility                 calculations which show, however, that even in these cases only                 relatively modest Stark fields of 60,000 volts/cm are required                  to orient the lowest rotational states of linear molecules such                 as ICN when they are cooled to 2 degrees Kelvin in a molecular                  beam.  This prediction, which Herschbach hopes to verify                        experimentally, would have an enormous impact on the whole                      field of reaction dynamics.  It would provide an important new                  capability to study orientation effects in colliding molecular                  beams which would be achievable at easily attainable                            experimental conditions.",
