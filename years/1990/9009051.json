 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop and to test empirically               a model of \"wait unemployment\" which is designed to explain both                the incidence of cyclical unemployment across skill groups and also             the extent of cyclical variation in job quality for workers of                  given skill.  The theoretical model provides a microeconomic                    foundation for the phenomenon of upward and downward mobility of                workers over the business cycle first observed by Arthur Okun.  The             treatment of unemployment in the model closely parallels the                    treatment of unextracted exhaustible resources in Hotelling's model             of natural resource extraction.  The model will be tested with                  panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey.  The project will             provide new estimates of the extent of cyclical variability in                  wages and \"job quality\" for workers either leaving unemployment or              else entering the labor force.  The theory predicts that it is                  these new job seekers, rather than the entire workforce, which will             experience significant cyclical variation in job opportunities.                                                                                                 This project addresses an important critique that has been levelled             against models assuming involuntary unemployment.  Even in the                  deepest recessions, substantial numbers of new jobs are constantly              being created and filled.  Assuming that employers prefer to fill               new jobs with the highest quality workers available, highly skilled             individuals can easily bump less skilled workers for the job                    openings which appear in recessions.  Simple models with                        involuntary unemployment imply incorrectly that the incidence of                cyclical unemployment will fall entirely on the least skilled                   members of the labor force.  The key insight pursued in this line               of research is that a high quality worker who takes a \"poor                     quality\" (low paying) job, perhaps in a recession, will suffer long             term consequences from this decision.  Preliminary work by the                  investigators under their previous NSF grant demonstrates that this             assumption is realistic and the theory yields many testable                     predictions regarding the behavior of the labor market.  This                   project extends the theory and tests it empirically.",
