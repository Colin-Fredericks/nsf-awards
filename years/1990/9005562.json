 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic is currently experiencing a thirty to fifty percent               springtime loss of its stratospheric ozone layer, resulting in a                least a several-fold increase in UVB (280-320nm) radiation                      reaching the surface of the Southern Ocean.  In spite of low                    solar elevation and persistent cloud cover, the magnitude of                    ultraviolet radiation fluence rates now experienced in polar                    regions roughly approaches that routinely measured in tropical                  latitudes.  Perhaps more importantly, biologically damaging UVB                 radiation has increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-                   400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-                    700nm) have remained unchanged.  This collaborative project will                use recently developed improvements in atmospheric modeling and                 in-water UV and visible spectroradiometers to conduct a field                   study during austral spring 1990.  The day-to-day variations in                 the magnitude and ratio of UVB:UVA:PAR irradiance incident on and               penetrating the euphotic zone of marginal ice edge Antarctic                    waters will be qualified.  The impact of this increase of UV                    radiation on abundance, composition and vitality of the                         phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom will be                documented.  During this time, strong vertical stratification                   restricts the phytoplankton to the upper water column, thus                     creating favorable conditions for increased UVB susceptibility.                 Special emphasis will be placed on defining biological restraints               imposed by enhanced UVB radiation and altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios                on the balance of UVB photodamage to photorepair, photoprotective               and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in the water column.                    The overall aim is an objective test of the hypothesis that                     phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely unfluenced by                   ozone depletion.",
