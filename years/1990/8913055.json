 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. James E.                             Bayfield and Dr. Richard H. Pratt, Department of Physics                        and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, to pursue with a                       team of Malaysian scientists led by Dr. Chon Sing Chong,                        School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Penang,                     Malaysia, for a period of 24 months, a program of                               cooperative research on threshold region elastic photon                         atom scattering.  The collaborators will use theory and                         experiment to study the extent to which current models                          describe elastic photon atom scattering in moderate to high                     atomic number media.  Cross sections will be measured for a                     variety of elements and scattering angles.  These                               experimentally obtained cross sections will be compared                         with theoretical predictions.  The use of experimental data                     to improve theoretical models will be explored.  Both small                     angle circular target geometry and transmission type                            geometry will be utilized in the measurements.                                                                                                                  This project involves cooperative research of two groups of                     investigators who have complementary skills and                                 facilities.  The experimental group at USM has a background                     of research in radiation metrology with efforts directed                        towards obtaining higher precision and more accurate                            measurement of total interaction coefficients and                               differential scattering cross sections of photons, in                           addition to applications-based research.  The group at                          Pittsburgh has considerable involvement in benchmark                            theoretical calculations.  Their interest has been in                           developing a firm physical understanding of the various                         possible photon interaction processes at the atomic level.                      The key collaborators are highly respected scientists who,                      for a number of years, have cooperated in the field of the                      research.  Their cooperation has been highly successful and                     has resulted in joint publications in refereed journals.                        This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science                       in Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                     level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers                      and their counterparts in developing countries through the                      exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.",
