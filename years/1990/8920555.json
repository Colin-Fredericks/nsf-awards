 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor                  Grant in a continuing experimental and theoretical study of                     bound-state surface intersections and their effects upon                        excited-state dynamics in isolated molecules.  The purpose of                   the work is to develop a more complete understanding of the                     consequences of coupling betwen electronic and nuclear motion                   in isolated molecules and complexes.                                                                                                                            The vibrational structure of intramolecular potential surface                   intersections is being studied experimentally in molecular                      beams pumped by lasers and probed by ionization-detected                        Rydberg absorption spectroscopy and zero-kinetic-energy                         photoelectron spectroscopy.  Systems being investigated include                 various triatomics and polyatomics; multiresonant techniques                    can give resolution to a vibrational-rotational level of                        detail.  Theoretical work is extending existing capabilities                    for handling large diagonalizations to allow the solving of                     three-state multimode problems.  Techniques are also being                      developed to derive classical analogs for radiationless                         dynamics of vibronically-mixed valence states of excited                        triatomics.  Berry's phase is also being investigated in                        extended parameter spaces.",
