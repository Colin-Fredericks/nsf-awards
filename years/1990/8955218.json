Modeled after the successful                           Molecular Cloning course, (TEI 87-51248), the DNA Science                       workshop extends the traditional postgraduate training                          mission of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to the secondary                       level.  During the week-long workshops, teachers make and                       analyze a recombinant DNA molecule, using the techniques of                     DNA restriction and ligation, agarose gel electrophoresis,                      microbial culture, bacterial transformation, and plasmid                        isolation.  A weekend follow-up workshop reinforces the                         learning experience and stresses the practical aspects of                       implementing a lab-teaching program.                                                                                                                            The current NSF-sponsored program has reached 449 biology                       teachers in 12 states-aided programs in California, North                       Carolina, and Wisconsin.  Statistical analysis has documented                   significant behavioral effects among workshop participants,                     including lab teaching, leadership networking, and                              fundraising activities that more than match NSF funds                           expended.  NSF support has been highly leveraged, forming the                   basis of what is arguably the largest commitment to public                      biotechnology education by any institution in the country.                                                                                                      The PIs now propose to hold four workshops per summer that                      would reach an additional 288 high school teachers in the                       southeast and midwest.  Three \"commuter\" workshops each                         summer would service large urban areas, while on                                \"residential\" workshop would target minority teachers from a                    wider geographic region.  We also request funding to continue                   a substantial longitudinal study of innovation among the                        1,600 teachers in 24 states who have been taught the DNA                        science curriculum to date.                                                                                                                                     An amount equivalent to 14.5% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
