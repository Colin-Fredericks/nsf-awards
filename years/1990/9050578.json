 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tho goal of the project was to strengthen the chemistry program at              Russell Sage by acquiring a new nuclear magnetic resonance                      spectrometer to replace one that has become obsolete and                        unreliable.  The instrument formerly in use, a seventeen year old               Varian EM360A, long occupied a role of central importance in the                chemistry curriculum, particularly in the area of organic                       chemistry.  However, this instrument suffered from serious bouts                of instability that have limited its utility.  Moreover, it could               not perform special NMR applications.  The acquisition of a new                 Varian EM360L spectrometer with complete supporting accessories                 greatly enhanced the chemistry program's capabilities in this area.             In addition to providing stable, reliable performance for routine               student use, this instrument made possible new and highly desirable             applications.  These include spin decoupling techniques to assist               in the analysis of complex spectral patterns, variable temperature              measurements for use in monitoring reactions, and the opportunity               to record fluorine and phosphorus spectra.  The instrument had                  major impact on a number of courses, and its special capabilities               were particularly valuable in connection with student research                  projects.  The University is matching the award with an equal                   amount of funds.",
