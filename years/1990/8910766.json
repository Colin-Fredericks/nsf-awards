 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterial metabolism often dominates energy and nutrient                   flow in aquatic ecosystems and thereby has a major impact on                    biogeochemical cycles as well as food webs.  There are numerous                 potential sources of nutrients fueling bacterial metabolism,                    but in many rivers and estuaries detrital material derived from                 vascular plants is likely to be of major importance.  This                      research will determine rates of bacterial production and                       respiration in a variety of systems including the Amazon River                  and several estuaries on the south Texas coast.  The sources of                 organic matter fueling bacterial growth and the chemical                        identity of this material will be investigated using stable                     isotope (C & N) compositions, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic                  resonance (NMR) and source-specific biomarker compounds.                        Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is thought to fuel most of the                   microbial heterotrophic production in these systems, and it                     appears likely that vascular plants contribute significantly to                 this pathway of nutrient flow.  In the proposed research the                    production, microbial transformations and fate of DOM derived                   form avariety of plant materials will be investigated during                    long-term (2-3yr) decomposition studies.   Diagenetic changes                   in the chemical and stable isotope compositions of both the                     particulate and dissolved components will be determined.                             The project team is well qualified. Institutional                          accommodations are good.  Collaboration and coordination with                   other work in progress will be productive.",
