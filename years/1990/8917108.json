 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to determine if evolution                  produces long term progressive improvements in organisms.  That                 is, do species become better adapted over time?  To test this                   idea Dr. Key will use the fossil record of bryozoans.  Bryozoans                are marine animals that were common in the geologic past and are                still abundant today.  They live like corals in large colonies on               the sea floor.  This study will focus on a single lineage of                    bryozoans consisting of roughly 140 species that all evolved from               a common ancestor.  The species within this lineage lived                       throughout the world from 480-380 million year ago.                                  The structural design of the colonies from the species                     within this lineage will be examined for progressive                            improvements.  Dr. Key will do this by measuring the                            constructional properties of the colonies and analyzing changes                 in these properties through the evolutionary history of the                     lineage.  This research should determine if bryozoans have become               more efficiently constructed over time.  This has implications on               all forms of life in that if there is no progressive improvement,               it may challenge our traditionally held view of evolutionary                    progress.",
