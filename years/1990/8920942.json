 "awd_abstract_narration": "This phase II SBIR project develops a prototype controller                      capable of enabling robot systems to perform dexterous                          manipulation in an efficient manner.  Currently, robots can                     perform simple manipulation tasks, but more complex dexterous                   manipulation tasks cannot be implemented in a real time sense                   due to the complexity of both the robot dynamics and the                        controller design.  Enhanced computational power is required                    to implement these real time controllers.  In 1985, the                         Center for Robotic Systems in Microelectronics at the                           University of California at Santa Barbara developed an                          operational prototype robotic controller, characterized by                      a unique architecture, with high performance.  The system was                   denoted Robotic Instruction Processing System (RIPS).                           Dynamic MicroSystems was organized to bring this new                            technology to the market place.  In a phase I research                          project, Dynamic MicroSystems evaluated the RIPS architecture                   for the purpose of developing an architecture which can serve                   as an industrial platform for advanced robots.  This phase                      II SBIR project's objectives are to (1) develop and build a                     prototype system comprising a host computer, two three                          dimensional processor subsystems, and one input output                          handler, (2) develop and test the proposed multiprocessor                       programming environment, (3) develop and test the proposed                      multi-window user interface, and (4) test and validate the                      complete system with a two arm cooperation simulation                           experiment.  This effort should culminate in the development                    of a reconfigurable open architecture modular controller                        system which will satisfy the computational needs for                           advanced robots, and provide a powerful, flexible, software                     development and analysis environment.",
