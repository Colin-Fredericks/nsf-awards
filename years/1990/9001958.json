 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed to attract undergraduate, particularly women           and minorities, into lasers and optics research,  with emphasis on              lightwave technology as an emerging technology.  Many recent studies,           including the National of Academies recent report on Photonics,                 identify this as one of the key technical growth areas of the future.           Inspiration for these students to continue into graduate school will            come from participating in research projects within the                         interdisciplinary Center for Laser Studies.  This research                      organization is unusual for its large percentage of women and                   minorities, both on its staff and in its graduate student population.           In 1989 the Center received REU site funding and developed a very               successful program which included three Chicanos, two females and one           black student.  This gives the Center a chance to better recruit                minority and women undergraduates and to provide more opportunity to            participate in research, inspiring them to continue in graduate                 students.  The projects include noise properties of semiconductor               arrays, characterization of nonlinear services, fabrication and                 characterization of heterojunction lasers, solid stat lasers, fiber-            optics power-by-light headset, and thermal transport in thin films.",
