 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed understanding of many photochemical processes                   in the troposphere requires simultaneous measurements of the                    abundances of oxidants and the oxides of nitrogen.  The goal of                 this research is to develop capabilities for nearly                             simultaneous measurements of key oxygen containing free                         radicals and oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere with high                     specificity and sensitivity using a spectroscopic technique.                    Ambient samples are drawn through nozzles into two separate                     detection chambers -- one for OH/HO2, pumped to 0.01                            atmosphere; one for NO2/NO, pumped to (0.01-1) atmosphere --                    where the radicals are detected by laser induced fluorescence.                  A high repetition rate (10 kHz) copper vapor laser pumps two                    dye lasers -- one frequency doubled to the 282 nm or 309 nm                     transitions of OH, the other operated at the 585 nm transitions                 of NO2.  Resonantly scattered photons are detected by high                      efficiency optics and photomultiplier tubes and are                             distinguished from background signals by tuning the dye lasers                  on and off molecular resonances.  HO2 and NO are detected by                    chemical conversion with NO and O3 to OH and NO2 respectively.                  The estimated detection limit (S/N ratio - 2) for OH/HO2 is                     .005 pptv (1.3 x 107 cm-3) in ten seconds.  This detection                      system will be used primarily for ground-based field                            measurements, but also                                                          in some requisite laboratory photochemical studies, and as a                    development tool for detection with other light sources and for                 other species.",
