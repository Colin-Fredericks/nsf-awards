 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of a software engineering                 teaching laboratory.  The laboratory would significantly improve the            curriculum of the courses dealing with the design and development of            quality software CS456 (Software Engineering), CS516 (System Analysis           and Design), and CS530, CS531 (COMPILERS); and the course dealing with          the Unix operating system (CS360).  A major problem facing the software         industry is the generation of quality software.  A partial solution to          this problem is improvement by Universities in the teaching of software         engineering.  One of the tools used in industry to assist in software           design and Development is computer aided software engineering or CASE           tools.  In order to adequately instruct students in the use of these            tools, it is necessary to give students hands-on experience.  The CASE          software and hardware requested would enable the department to better           instruct undergraduates in the development of quality software.  The            tools would be used for instruction in CS456 and CS516.  In CS530 and           CS531 students would apply these tools to assist in the development of          a significant software project.  In addition, since the requested work          stations are Unix based, it would also be possible to give lower                division students adequate access, and hence experience with, Unix              based systems.",
