 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Hunter College is                    undertaking a major upgrade of its three freshman laboratories.                 Over one thousand students a year enroll in the Calculus=based and              the Algebra-based freshman physics courses and in a one-semester                Basic Concepts of Physics course.  The fifteen new laboratory                   experiences include a group of three kinematic experiments, tow                 acoustic wave and four optics experiments.  The remaining five                  cover areas from gravitation, thermodynamics, electricity,                      magnetism and radioactivity.  The laboratory experiences include                repetition of classic experiments as well as opportunity to allow               a close-up touch-and-feel of basic phenomena.  A majority of the                laboratory experiments include computer assisted data collection.               Microcomputer based data analysis and graphing are provided                     throughout the year-long laboratory course.  The college is                     providing more than twice the amount of the grant in support of the             project.//",
