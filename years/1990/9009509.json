 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of three independent parts.  The first                    investigates in detail a different approach to the analysis of                  renegotiation of contracts.  The emphasis of this approach is on                taking explicit account of the role of the time dimension in the                implementation and the renegotiation of contracts.  The notion of               renegotiation proofness employed here recognizes the fact that                  renegotiation of contracts normally involves some costs.  The                   results so far indicate that this approach yields significantly                 different predictions than has been common in the related                       literature.  The second part investigates the effect of small                   deviations from perfect maximizing behavior on the functioning of               dynamic and decentralized markets.  The basic intuition is that                 such models may capture explicitly the idea that the maximizing                 agents devote special efforts to gain at the expense of the nearly              rational ones and in the proces disrupt significantly the operation             of such markets.  The third part is concerned with an industrial                organization problem.  The purpose is to investigate the nature of              inventory accumulation resulting from strategic considerations                  faced by a durable goods monopoly.                                                                                                                              This research is significant because it enriches and changes                    important lines of research.  For example, this project develops                renegotiation-proofness criteria which take explicit account of the             time cost of renegotiating contracts.  There is a large, growing                literature on the conditions that must hold for contracts to be                 renegotiation proof.  This literature is important because the                  possibility of contract renegotiation can lead to inefficient                   market outcomes.  Preliminary work by the investigator demonstrates             that introducing time into contract renegotiation theory                        dramatically changes the results and suggests many promising new                directions of research.",
