This                           equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the                   R/V ALPHA HELIX, a research vessel owned by the NSF and                         operated by the University.  A substantial part of the ship's                   operating schedule during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The instrumentation will also increase                      the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to                          support research and engineering activities.  The                               instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -Peripheral computer equipment for a SUN workstation that is                     used for accessing and managing large data sets at sea and                      at the shore-based laboratory,                                                 -Microcomputer and associated equipment for increasing                           shared-use, sea-going computing and communications                              capabilities,                                                                                                                                                  The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                         research and engineering projects.",
