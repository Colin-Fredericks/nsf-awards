 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to equip an undergraduate Molecular                   Biology laboratory at the University of Southern California with                those instruments necessary to offer an introductory course to                  students planning careers in biological research or medicine.                   The Department of Biological Sciences awards bachelor degrees                   with a variety of major options to 120 students per year.  Many                 of these students would be better prepared for their career goals               if they are introduced to research techniques in molecular                      biology.  A limited number now satisfy this need by taking                      directed research in faculty laboratories.  This course would                   allow them to acquire the basic skills in an instructional                      laboratory while still leaving them the option of individual                    faculty directed research.                                                                                                                                      The Molecular Biology laboratory course will admit selected                     honors level juniors and seniors who have completed courses in                  introductory molecular biology and introductory biochemistry with               laboratory.  The course will provide students with experience in                mutation analysis, plasmid utilization and analysis, RFLP                       analysis by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction                            applications, DNA synthesis and sequencing, gene cloning and                    analysis, bacterial genetics, and phage genetics.  A recently                   remodeled laboratory in the microbiology instructional area with                adjacent preparative facilities is dedicated to the sole use of                 this course in the fall semester and continuation projects in the               spring semester.                                                                                                                                                The NSF funds and university matching funds will together provide               for 10 completely equipped paired student work stations plus the                larger community use equipment which is required.  Individual                   experiments will be directed by the departmental faculty member                 most experienced in the specific techniques required.  A member                 of the instructional laboratory faculty will have the course as a               full-time responsibility and experienced teaching assistants will               be present at all time.",
