 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years, most researchers believed the left cerebral                     hemisphere to be specialized for language and the right for                     perception and mental imagery.  In the early 1980's, it became                  clear, however, that the left hemisphere is actually better than                the right at some imagery tasks, but it is worse than the right                 at other imagery tasks and roughly as good as the right at still                other imagery tasks.  It is now clear that complex tasks such as                imagery are not performed by a single part of the brain, but                    rather arise from the joint action of many components working in                concert.  Some of these actions apparently are carried out by the               left hemisphere, and some are carried out by the right.  This                   research will characterize the nature of these component                        processes and will determine how they are lateralized to the left               or right hemisphere.  For example, experiments will examine the                 processes that allow one to activate a pattern into a visual                    image, to rotate patterns in images, and to \"inspect\" patterns in               images.  Patients who have suffered damage to the left or right                 cerebral hemisphere will be tested on a set of imagery tasks, and               their deficits compared.  The theory underlying the research                    holds that some tasks will be impaired more following damage to                 the left hemisphere than the right and others will be impaired                  more following damage to the right hemisphere.  Examination of                  which tasks are always lateralized in the same way as certain                   other tasks will provide evidence for the existence of distinct                 processes.  Furthermore, these patterns of lateralization will                  allow for the test of computer models of how experience affects                 cerebral lateralization.  The increased understanding of imagery                gained from this research is relevant to training in various                    branches of science and engineering, because of the critical role               of imagery in the spatial thinking so necessary in those areas.                 If we understand the component processes of imagery and which                   processes are used in which kinds of tasks, we may be able to                   train people to use imagery more effectively in their thinking.                 Such training might allow students who would otherwise drop out                 of visually oriented technical disciplines to succeed in such                   work.",
