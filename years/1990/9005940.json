 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular methods of DNA analysis will be employed to                      examine the genetic relatedness among populations of several                    marine species that have global distributions.  Special attention               will be devoted to marine turtles, where longstanding questions                 exist concerning the historical times of rookery colonization,                  whether females return to their natal sites to nest, and the                    degree of genetic contact among rookeries involving both males                  and females.  This molecular  appraisal of the life history of                  marine turtles will offer evidence on the degree of demographic                 independence among turtle colonies that should be critical in the               development of populaton management strategies for these                        endangered species.  Similar molecular genetic assays will also                 be conducted on globally-distributed oceanic birds, which may                   prove to exhibit life history and migrational patterns somewhat                 analogous to those of the marine turtles.  Assays of DNA from                   both the nuclear and mitochondrial genes in these and other                     marine species will provide knowledge of migratory patterns in                  organisms that are difficult to observe directly.  The data will                also contribute to development of a history in which the degree                 of concordance among the genealogies of independent genes is                    proposed as an indicator of the historical magnitudes of                        population separations.",
