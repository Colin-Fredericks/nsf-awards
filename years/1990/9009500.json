 "awd_abstract_narration": "A surprising fact that has emerged in recent years is the                  great degree of genetic similarity between humans and                           chimpanzees.  Ninety-eight percent of human single-copy DNA  (the               inherited genetic material) is so similar to chimpanzee DNA that                it forms hybrid human-chimpanzee DNA molecules when mixed                       together under appropriate conditions in a test tube.  Dr. Ruvolo               will study the 2% of human DNA which does not form hybrid                       molecules with chimpanzee DNA.  Because only a fraction of all                  DNA consists of genes (protein-coding units), the first question                to answer is whether there are any genes in this 2% \"human-                     specific\" DNA fraction.  If there are, they will be characterized               by DNA sequencing.  If not, then the genes most different between               humans and chimpanzees can still be isolated from the other 98%                 of human DNA and similarly characterized by DNA sequencing.  In                 either case, Dr. Ruvolo will isolate those genes maximally                      different between humans and chimpanzees.  These DNA sequences                  will be compared with all known DNA sequences by computer search                techniques to test whether, and in what way, they resemble any                  known genes.                                                                         This research is important because it develops a general                   method for identifying genes maximally different between closely-               related species.  Such genes are useful in population biology and               in systematics for determining how groups and species are related               to one another.  Extension of this method may allow isolation of                genes common to groups of organisms, such as \"primate-specific\"                 or \"mammal-specific\" genes.  Isolation of the most rapidly-                     evolving genes in humans can help partition the human genome into               ancient and modern segments.",
