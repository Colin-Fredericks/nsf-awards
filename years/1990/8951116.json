 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to purchase equipment that will allow                 faculty to develop an alternative version of an introductory                    psychology laboratory course (Learning & Motivation) that is an                 integral part of the undergraduate psychology curriculum at                     Northeastern University.  This alternative course substitutes human             laboratory and animal field experiments for traditional animal                  laboratory studies.  Major equipment items to be purchased include              portable event and video recorders, and video cameras for field                 experiments of animal learning.  Also to be purchased are standard              video recording equipment, personal computers, software packages,               printers and interfaces for laboratory studies of behavioral and                physiological conditioning in humans.  Examination of the history               and rationale for using laboratory animals in this introductory                 course indicate that the field has matured to the point where the               original reasons for doing so are no longer viable or essential to              meet pedagogical goals of the science.  Equally important, the new              version will enhance the student's learning experience in important             ways and draw attention to the fact that behavioral scientists are              sensitive to animal welfare issues and willing to make considered               changes.  The proposed course will serve as an attractive model for             hundreds of colleagues who teach this type of laboratory course                 throughout the United States.",
