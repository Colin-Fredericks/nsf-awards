 "awd_abstract_narration": "How did the universe, which apparently began with an almost                     perfectly uniformly expanding Big Bang, evolve into the present                 exceedingly complex and granular structure of galaxies, clusters                and superclusters of galaxies, and vast voids?  Theories to                     account for this are best tested by observations of the changing                clustering of objects over exceedingly great distances and look-                back times toward the beginning.  Only quasars are bright enough                to permit this, but they are too few in number to define the                    early structure.  Far more numerous absorbing objects exist                     between us and the distant quasars.  Using an existing multifiber               spectrograph (to be improved in the second year of the grant) and               the McDonald Observatory 2.7-meter reflector to detect and ana-                 lyze the redshifts of these absorbing clouds along lines of sight               to the quasars, the clustering of large numbers of otherwise                    undetectable high redshift objects can be described, thereby                    directly studying the evolution of large-scale structure in the                 universe.  The effects of ionizing flux from quasars upon their                 local neutral hydrogen environment will also be measured, and the               incidence of galaxy void sized holes in the neutral hydrogen                    distribution will be determined.                                                                                                                                Dr. Smith is the Director of McDonald Observatory, and has worked               for many years in extragalactic studies.  Dr. Crotts, the co-                   investigator, is a leading young instrumentalist.",
