 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will direct the establishment of                a \"Regional Geometry Institute.\"  Research mathematicians,                      graduate students, pre-college teachers, and high school students               will form a community with the goal of learning dynamics while                  coming to understand each individual's special viewpoint.  For                  the most part, this award will support the \"Advanced Research                   Component,\" which over the course of the project will convene the               foremost dynamical systems theorists in the world, college                      research faculty, and graduate students.  Research activities in                complex analytic dynamics, computational complexity, attractors,                renormalization, annular maps, neural networks, and fractal                     geometry will be organized by several experts.  Activities are                  also planned between summers.                                                        Coupled to this award will be a four-year project funded                   through the Division for Teacher Preparation and Enhancement                    (TPE-8954797).  Entitled, \"Contemporary Mathematics and                         Technology as a Driving Force for School Reform,\" this project                  will draw pre-college teachers from two Boston area school                      districts to the same environment to learn dynamics and methods                 by which these topics can be infused into the high school                       curriculum.  Also coupled to these projects in the first year is                a Young Scholars Project (RCD-8855151) entitled Project PROMYS-                 Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists.  This ongoing                      project draws bright high school students together to study a                   variety of research problems in dynamical systems which have been               tailored to their level of mathematics expertise.                                    Participants from each of the three funded projects will                   have extensive opportunities to work together and learn from one                another.  Mixed groups will be formed for day-to-day discussions                and field trips.  These will study dynamics problems from several               viewpoints.  A well-equipped \"Dynamics Lab\" will be made                        available to all participants and is seen as a focal point for                  interaction activities.",
