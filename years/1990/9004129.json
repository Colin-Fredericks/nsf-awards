 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides further funding for Dr. S. F. Yang, to enable               him to continue his research on ethylene biosynthesis.  Assisted                by other NSF-supported younger collaborators, Yang has                          demonstrated that ethylene is synthesized from methionine via S-                adenosylmethionine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.                   The principal objectives of the project now to be carried out by                Dr. Yang are (a) to purify fully and characterize 1-                            aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and to determine the               amino acid sequence around the active site of this enzyme                       isolated from apples and other plant tissues, (b) to clone the                  gene for this enzyme from apples, (c) to characterize the                       inactivation of the synthase by S-adenosylmethionine in relation                to the enzyme's in vivo turnover, and (d) to characterize enzymes               involved in the so-called methionine cycle.                                                                                                                     Ethylene is a plant hormone responsible for the control of                      numerous aspects of plant growth and development.  This hormone                 is commercially important in agriculture and in relation to post-               harvest crop physiology.  The work to be pursued here is aimed at               obtaining basic knowledge that can later be used as a basis for                 manipulating the levels of ethylene in plants, either upward or                 downward.  This is a promising approach to optimizing certain                   agricultural systems.  Dr. Yang's studies will provide a useful                 theoretical basis from which ethylene production by crop plants                 can be regulated via biotechnology.",
