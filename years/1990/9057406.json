 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide research support to Dr. Westmoreland                   under the National Science Foundation's Presidential Young                      Investigator Awards (PYIA) Program.  The objectives of the                      PYIA Program are to provide support to the Nation's most                        outstanding and promising young science and engineering                         faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of                  U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly                  qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and                    industrial research and teaching.  Dr. Westmoreland's field of                  research is the study of chemical reactions ranging from the                    plasma fabrication of microelectronic devices to combustion                     and pyrolysis.                                                                                                                                                  He plans to combine molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS)                     with optical spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and GC/MS to                     map concentrations within laboratory reactors.  This                            combination permits quantitative measurements both of reactive                  species (free radicals, singlet species like silicon                            dihydride, and ions) and of stable species.  Plasma-enhanced                    chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of amorphous silicon films                    from silane will be studied in an MBMS apparatus.  A near-term                  goal is describing the existing commercial PECVD of amorphous                   silicon: hydrogen, silicon dioxide, and silicon-nitrogen films                  with sufficient accuracy for process and product-quality                        control, but understanding at a molecular scale will also be                    later directed toward new films and applications.  His goals                    in combustion and pyrolysis are to establish and apply                          detailed chemical mechanisms of oxidation and growth,                           particularly the formation of aromatics.  He will study three                   carbon hydrocarbons (propane, propene, propyne, and                             propadiene) to determine whether three carbon radicals form                     benzene, whether the benzene is formed via four carbon radical                  pathways,  and whether molecular or insertion reactions might                   also be involved.",
