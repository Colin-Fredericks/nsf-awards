 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pyroclastic flows are poorly understood, hazardous mixtures of                  expanding gas and hot ash that can move tens of kilometers at                   velocities in excess of 100 km/sec.  Pyroclastic flows are                      dangerous to observe and rarely coincide with researchers'timing.               This project, therefore, will begin a multi-disciplinary study to               investigate how pyroclastic flows work.  Pyroclastic density                    currents can be produced in the laboratory by pouring 600oC. ash                down an inclined surface that is moistened with water.                          Preliminary experiments successfully produce flows with many of                 the features of natural pyroclastic flows.  A moving flow has                   three parts; a sediment-rich basal avalanche, an overriding ash                 cloud surge and a convecting ash cloud.  The environmental                      conditions of experimental flows can be easily controlled                       individually and the effects on the flow noted.  Of principle                   concern are the factors that affect the mobility of pyroclastic                 flows because of the obvious importance of runout in hazard                     assesment.  The results of such a study are likely to improve the               assesment of hazards due to pyroclastic flows, which is a serious               societal responsibility for volcanologists.",
