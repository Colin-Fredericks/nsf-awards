 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct calculation of the structural and spectral properties of                 chemical species occurring in minerals and in hydrothermal                      solutions will be performed using proven techniques from                        molecular quantum chemistry.  For halide, oxide and sulfide                     complexes of 1st transition series metals the P.I.'s will                       calculate equilibrium structures, vibrational frequencies and                   electric field gradients. They will study both complexes                        existing in solution, such as aquated Zn(SH)n2-n, and molecular                 cluster models for species  occurring in minerals, such as                      Fe(OH2)62+.  One goal of the study will be to encourage the use                 of transition metal NMR within geochemistry.  They will also                    calculate Mossbauer parameters (chemical isomer shift and                       electric field gradient) for Fe in various oxide and sulfide                    environments using conventional SCF methods.  They will continue                their studies of the electronic properties of sulfur containing                 ligands and their interaction with transition metals.  They will                also continue our studies of polarizabilities and NMR shieldings                of oxidic molecules containing B, Al, Si and P.   They plan to                  study polarizability anisotropies for  less symmetric species and               to more accurately include the influence of counterions.                        Similarly, studies of isotropic NMR shieldings for silicate                     species will be extended to study NMR anisotropies in lower                     symmetry environments.  Finally, a series of experiments and                    theoretical studies will be completed for small ring systems.",
