 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator's preliminary analysis of Geosat                altimetry observations reveal an abrupt change in mid-ocean ridge               axis gravity with spreading rate that is more pronouced than the                topographic variations. below a spreading rate of 60-70 mm/yr the               ridge-axis gravity signature has high amplitudes and is variable                where as above this rate the gravity depends upon both the                      topography and the compensation mechanism, the abrupt change in                 the gravity signature must signify an abrupt change in the                      isostatic compensation mechanism, there being no abrupt change in               the topography. The principal investigator's interpretation is                  that there are two dynamically distinct modes of seafloor                       spreading. This work will address the problem of ridge-axis                     morphology and its variation with spreading rate, crustal                       thinckness, and mantle temperature from both a modeling and                     observational stand point. The objectives are to develop a                      quantitative model of ridge-axis dynamics which in corporates a                 realistic non-linear flowlaw as well as a rheologically distinct                crust and mantle to characterize ridge exis/flank gravity and                   ridge axis/flanktopography in terms of spreading rate, crustal                  thickness and inferred mantle temperature, and, by comparing                    model gravity/topography with observations, to establish the role               of the weak lower crustal layer in the transition between                       spreading types.",
