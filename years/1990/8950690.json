 "awd_abstract_narration": "An undergraduate laboratory for robotics, computer-vision and                   automated manufacturing is established.  The laboratory will serve              senior-level undergraduate students in electrical engineering,                  computer science and mechanical engineering.  The laboratory will               provide practical experience for reinforcing the scientific and                 engineering principles learned in an undergraduate lecture courses              in robots and manufacturing.  The laboratory will consist of five               experimental setups in a room of 900 sq. ft.  Each setup contains               a desk-top robot arm, a desk-top computer, and a computer-vision                system.  Additionally, an automated milling machine is available.               Each student will perform experiments with the robot arm and the                milling machine.  The student will be required to develop software to           control the robot to perform various tasks with the aid of                      vision feedback, to measure robot characteristics, and to                       demonstrate principles learned in the lecture classes.  Each                    student will program and translate a CAM program to cause the                   milling machine to manufacture an object.",
