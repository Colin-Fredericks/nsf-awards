 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic programming algorithms are widely used for analyzing the                control of nonlinear dynamic systems.  These algorithms are                     computationally intensive, especially for stochastic problems.                  Supercomputers and parallel processing will facilitate the use of               dynamic programming algorithms for realistic problems that could                not be addressed in the past because of computational                           limitations.  The proposal concentrates on the following issues:                                                                                                a) parallel processing of Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP)                  and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), b) coupling DDP to                  finite elements models, and c)special algorithms for SDP with                   binary control variables.  The research focuses on systems with                 continuously valued state variables, and hence the analysis will                examine the computation of SDP with linear or nonlinear                         interpolation in the state space.  The computational effect on                  CPU and on parallel processing of using implicit or explicit                    finite element models in conjunction with DPP will be                           investigated.  Large-scale numerical results will be computed at                the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF) in                           co-operation with CNSF staff.  The results of the investigation                 will be applied to several \"real\" problems arising in                           environmental management as well as to hypothetical test                        examples.//",
