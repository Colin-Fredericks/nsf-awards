Specific features                       include a Bulletin Board which will disseminate information                     on meetings, workshops, conferences, publications, safety                       information, etc., and a conferencing capability through                        which network members can discuss bulletin board items,                         exchange ideas, and promote activities such as a                                Demonstration of the Month.  The network will be designed as                    a Wide Area Network reaching isolated and underprepared                         teachers, and will have the capability of itself being                          linked to a larger electronic network such as NSFNet for                        future networking of the teachers with scientists and                           teachers outside the region.",
