 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to isolate a library of genomic DNA from                         the archaebacter Methanococcus jannaschii.  The organism                        is an extreme thermo- and barophile, its natural habitat                        being in the vicinity of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent at                        a pressure of 260 atm. (Methanococcus jannaschii is the                         most thermophilic organism from which DNA has been                              isolated with a laboratory growth optimum of 92oC).  The                        DNA from this extraordinary microorganism will be cloned                        into Escherichia coli using standard molecular biology                          procedures.  The genomic library will be screened for the                       gene encoding a hydrogenase enzyme.   Expression of the                         hydrogenase gene, using an approach which has already                           proved successful in cloning methanogenic bacterial                             genes, will enable not only the investigation of the                            processes controlling extreme thermostability and                               barophilicity, but also the production of a potentially                         valuable commercial enzyme.  Using the approaches of                            site-directed and random mutagenesis a family of similar                        enzymes with differing responses to temperature and                             pressure will be generated.  This series of closely                             related mutant enzymes will be far easier to compare than                       a set of related hydrogenases isolated from meso- and                           thermophiles.  Since the enzyme is extremely                                    thermostable, it should be possible to delineate some of                        the structure-function relationships which give rise to                         marked stability.  Of particular interest is the response                       of the hydrogenase to increased pressure (especially                            since there could be a physiological role for such a                            response in deep sea organisms).  The pressure regulation                       of this enzyme will be investigated in detail.  Some                            enzymes are activated or inactivated by large pressure                          changes, but, this hydrogenase is the first enzyme which                        triples activity over a relatively small change in                              pressure from 7.5 to 260 atm.  The kinetic results of the                       proposed research will be related to the structure of the                       enzyme.  In addition, enough enzyme will be purified to                         enable an early attempt at crystallization.",
