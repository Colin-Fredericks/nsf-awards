 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists                in a joint U.S.-Japan seminar on the subject of quantum                         electronic manipulation of atoms and electromagnetic fields.                    Research in this area is producing both fundamental new                         insights and new possibilities for applications.  Current                       efforts include the manipulation of atoms and ions through                      laser cooling and trapping; the manipulation of fields through                  laser frequency stabilization and by the production of so-                      called \"squeezed\" states; and the control of radiative atomic                   processes through application of principles of cavity quantum                   electrodynamics.  This newly acquired ability to produce                        \"unconventional\" states of light and matter that are very                       different from their normal states is bringing fundamental                      new insights into quantum mechanics, as well as giving rise to                  potential applications in such areas as high resolution                         spectroscopy, precise frequency standards, and gravity wave                     detection efforts.  This comes about because of the                             possibilities these techniques offer, for example, in reducing                  both amplitude noise and frequency noise in laser light, and                    in significantly reducing Doppler effects in atomic                             spectroscopic studies, leading to more accurate determinations                  of atomic energy levels and precise measurements of frequencies                 and time.                                                                                                                                                       Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1)                      physics and applications of trapped, cooled ions; (2) laser                     cooling and trapping of neutral atoms; (3) ultrahigh precision                  control of lasers; (4) generation of unconventional states of                   light; and (5) cavity quantum electrodynamics.  Participants                    will include many of the U.S. and Japanese researchers most                     active in this set of strongly interrelated topical areas.                      The seminar will be held September 3-7, 1990, in Kyoto, Japan.                  Co-organizers are Dr. William D. Phillips, Center for Atomic,                   Molecular, and Optical Physics, National Institute of Standards                 and Technology; and Dr. Fujio Shimizu, Faculty of Engineering,                  University of Tokyo, Japan.  Previous related U.S.-Japan                        seminars in laser spectroscopy, quantum optics, and quantum                     electronics served to keep the relevant research communities                    in the two countries abreast of each other's current progress,                  and to stimulate collaborative projects and exchanges of                        scientists.  This seminar is expected to be similarly effective.",
