 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living matters are sustained by large-scale cycles of                       energy and chemical elements, and one of the most essential                     elements in biological materials is nitrogen.  To study the                     many different biological processes which govern the nitrogen                   status in the biosphere is, therefore, of vital importance.                     Nitrogenase and nitrite reductase are two enzymes which                         catalyze key steps in the nitrogen cycle.  Nitrogenase                          catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia                 (nitrogen fixation) and many microorganisms use it to                           assimilate nitrogen into the living system.  Nitrate reductase                  reduces nitrite to ammonia and a variety of nitrate-reducing                    bacteria, as well as some sulfate reducing bacteria, use it for                 terminal respiration and dissimilates nitrogen back to the                      physical world.  Structural and functional studies of these                     enzymes are therefore of fundamental importance and should                      provide information pertinent to the understanding of our                       living environment.                                                                  In this application, Dr. Huynh proposes to perform                         Mossbauaer studies of the following enzymes:                                         1.  the vanadium-iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme                    system from Azotobacter vinelandii.                                                  2.  the nitrite reductase from Desulfovibrio                               desulfuricans.                                                                       Both the vanadium-iron protein and nitrite reductase are                   complex enzymes containing multiple iron centers which      can                 be most effectively studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy.  The                     proposed experiments include (i)characterizations of the                        native enzymes, (ii)redoxtitration studies, (iii) pH-                           dependence investigations and (iv)examinations of substrate-                    and ligand-binding effects.  The Mossbauer results will be                      correlated with data obtained form other physico-biochemical                    methods, including optical and electron paramagnetic resonance                  techniques.  Dr. Huynh hopes to fully characterize the iron                     centers in these enzymes, to obtain physical and biochemical                    properties, to reveal the roles these iron centers play in                      their enzymatic functions and to enhance our understanding of                   the mechanisms of biological nitrogen fixation and nitrite                      reduction.",
