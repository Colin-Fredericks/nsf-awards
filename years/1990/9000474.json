 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses causes of urban homicide rates.   The PI                 will draw hypotheses from four competing theoretical perspec-                   tives: (1) Subculture of violence, the idea that areas with high                homicide rates are characterized by a higher expected (or tolera-               ted) level of violence; (2) Socioeconomic, the idea that violence               is a consequence of material deprivation, such as homicides                     connected with robbery; (3) Punishment and deterrence, the idea                 that homicide rates rise and fall with changes in certainty and                 severity of punishment; (4) Life patterns, a more complex idea                  involving motivation, opportunities, and lack of effective                      guardians such as police.  Each theory has strong proponents, but               data seldom have been applied to compare the predictive success                 of each.  Part of the reason for the lack of empirical verifica-                tion has been the difficulty of obtaining longitudinal data.                    This project uses matched areas, with a 30-year time span, to                   estimate a model incorporating hypotheses from all four theories.                                                                                               The results should permit assessment of contribution of the                     factors specified in each theory, and understanding conditions                  under which each theoretical process is most likely to appear.",
