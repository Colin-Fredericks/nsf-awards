 "awd_abstract_narration": "The systolic array is a paradigm for concurrent computation that is             suited to VLSI technology.  Many algorithms (e.g., in digital signal            processing and scientific computation) are perfect candidates for               implementation on systolic arrays.  We investigate fundamental systolic         algorithms so that they can be realized on systolic arrays that are             provably time-minimal, and processor-minimal.  That is, we design arrays        that operate systolically, fully exploit all the parallelism in the             algorithm, and do so using as few processors as possible.  The schedules        for this kind of optimality often are nonlinear, and this is a                  significant departure from the extant research on optimal affine                schedules for systolic algorithms.  This research tells us what is the          very best that we can accomplish with systolic realizations of                  fundamental algorithms.                                                                                                                                         The investigation of a corresponding systolic programming system is also        underway; software tools are critical to the realization of systolic            arrays' potential.  The systolic programming system is intended to be           a natural and high-level vehicle for conducting research into systolic          algorithms, and for their optimal realization on systolic arrays.",
