 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and                 combinatorics of Professor Bernd Sturmfels of Cornell University.               Dr. Sturmfels has proposed to make use of the combinatorial structure           of convex polytopes to attack problems in constructive algebra                  and algebraic geometry. His research on combinatorial structures                arising in geometry will include a study of higher-order matroids               associated with graded ideals and how they relate to the state                  polytopes of these ideals.                                                           This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
