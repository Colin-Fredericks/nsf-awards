 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does the context in which we see something (for example, a                  word or an object) influence what we see and how accurately and                 rapidly we see it?  In daily experience and in the experimental                 laboratory, it is clear that context, such as the sentence                      surrounding a word or the scene in which an object appears, can                 help or hurt perception, but just how that happens cannot be                    understood without addressing some basic questions about visual                 cognition.  Is a written word (for example) first identified                    solely on the basis of the visual information, with the context                 having its effects as the word's meaning is integrated with the                 sentence of which it is a part?  Or, does the context play a role               in determining how fast the word is seen, or even what word is                  seen?  This research will investigate the interaction of context                and stimulus information in seeing and remembering words (and                   sometimes pictures) at four sequential stages in processing a                   sentence or list.                                                                                                                                               The four stages or levels will be studied using four techniques,                each of which is expected, on theoretical grounds, to tap a                     different stage.  The first studies will make use of a phenomenon               called \"repetition blindness,\" in which the second of a pair of                 identical items on a list tends to \"disappear\" if it arrives very               soon after the first one.  This disappearance seems to happen at                a very early stage of perception of the second item (perhaps                    within the first 1/20 of a second); the question is whether                     surrounding context can affect this early stage.  The second set                of studies will tap a somewhat later stage (perhaps in the first                1/10 of a second) involving selection of one perceived word from                several possible words that the glimpsed word might actually be.                A frequent effect that happens at this stage involves mistaking a               \"nonword\" like DACK for a real word such as DECK; the studies                   will look at the influence of sentence context on that effect.  A               third stage will be studied by presenting two words                             simultaneously and briefly, in the middle of a sentence, causing                the reader to make an immediate choice of the one that fits the                 context.  A successful choice will indicate that the words must                 have been processed (perhaps unconsciously).  At a fourth stage,                after the word itself is recognized, its meaning is \"tuned\" to                  fit the sentence as a whole. This stage will be studied by                      investigating involuntary intrusions of substitute words that may               fit better in a given context.                                                                                                                                  The significance of the research lies in its role in helping us                 understand in detail the process of reading and language                        comprehension, in order to place the teaching of reading and the                use of written communication on a rational scientific foundation.",
