 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution, ecology, and taxonomic variations of                     contemporary patterns of ornamental and ritual plant species are the            observable end product of no longer observable and often poorly                 documented prehistoric and historic processes.  These patterns provide          a solid framework for reconstructing the past and for interpreting              current human-environmental relationships.  Although ornamental                 and ritual flora have often been noted as important elements in the             cultures of modern Mexico and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, they have not          been studied extensively.  This doctoral dissertation research project          will focus on the complex of culturally significant flora in four               ecologically and economically distinct Yucatecan Mayan communities.             Among the plants to be studied are Yucatecan species, pre-Columbian             domesticates, colonial-era introductions and species that have been             incorporated more recently.  The researcher will survey housegardens to         determine species and cultivars present, observe ceremonies to                  determine plant species used, and interview gardeners and ceremonial            participants.                                                                                                                                                        This biogeographical study will contribute to a fuller                     understanding of Mayan ethnobotany and culture.  In addition, it will           address more general questions of plant domestication and human                 ecology.  The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a          promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research             skills.",
