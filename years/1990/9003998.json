 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                               investigation project in learning from this damaging                            event.                                                                                                                                                          This project concentrates on the seismic performance of                         elevators during the earthquake and relates this learning                       to the current elevator code requirement.                                                                                                                       A damage survey indicates that the Loma Prieta earthquake                       has caused extensive elevator damage, although the design                       details that contributed to the problems are not known.                         It is clear that seismic switches, optional in California                       but required for the National code, did not performed as                        intended.  This earthquake provides an opportunity to                           identify the deficiencies of current elevator codes and                         improve our understanding of the seismic performance of                         elevators.                                                                                                                                                      Several buildings that experienced elevator damages will                        be selected to represent a range of configurations,                             structural systems, types of elevator equipment, and                            locations.  A detailed inspection of elevators will be                          made based on damage details from expert interviews.  Code                      provisions will be evaluated in light of observed damage                        and changes suggested.  Finally, the malfunctions                               effecting the performance of seismic safety devices will                        be evaluated.                                                                                                                                                   This study will upgrade the current code requirements                           governing the seismic safety of elevator systems.",
