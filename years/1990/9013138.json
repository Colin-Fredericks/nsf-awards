 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor                  Simon's time-resolved investigations of solute relaxation,                      charge transfer, and electron solvation in liquid media.  These                 studies give important insight into detailed dynamical                          processes in the liquid state.                                                                                                                                  Using a variety of steady state and ultrafast time-resolved                     techniques, he is examining how solvent dielectric friction                     influences molecular rotational motions and the localization                    and solvation of photogenerated electrons.  The role of dynamic                 solvation and vibrational relaxation in charge transfer is also                 being studied.  A new approach based on time-resolved                           measurement of circular dichroism is being applied to the study                 of solute relaxation both in polar and nonpolar fluids.  The                    effects of solvent friction on intramolecular rotations around                  bonds, on molecular inversion, and on structural relaxation on                  ground state potential surfaces are being examined.",
