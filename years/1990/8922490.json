 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports John A. Burns and Robert Wheeler of Virginia                Polytechnic and State University (VPI) to collaborate in engineering            systems research with Wolfgang Desch and others of the Institute                for Mathematics of the University of Graz, Austria.  Their                      collaboration focuses on two areas: stabilization of viscoelastic               systems, and preservation of system properties under approximation.             Their joint efforts benefit from expertise in different aspects of              these problems.  The VPI group has considerable experience in                   applications, modelling and computation (aerodynamics, large space              structures, visco-elasticity and large scale computing), as well                as a strong background in complex analysis and classical analysis.              The researchers in Graz have a long history in semigroup theory,                control theory and approximation theory.                                                                                                                        By their very nature, numerical analysis and control theory are                 interdisciplinary subjects; they require interaction of several                 fields of mathematics and engineering.  The complementary expertise             of the two research groups in modeling, computation and analysis                virtually assures more productivity than independent efforts.                   They are focusing on several control systems of current interest                for aerospace vehicles and other systems.",
