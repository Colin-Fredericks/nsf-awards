 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to develop a receptor                        modeling method that explicitly accounts for the                                fractionation in chemical composition of volatile organic                       carbon compounds that occurs in transit from emission-                          sources to the receptor location.  The project also                             includes the design of a field study that will                                  simultaneously provide data for receptor modeling,                              evaluation of the performance of the model, and its use in                      conducting an inventory of volatile organic carbon                              releases to the environment.                                                                                                                                    This is a Research Planning Grant made to support a                             proposal submitted in response to the Program                                   Announcement, NSF 87-56, Research Opportunities for Women.                      This project addresses an important issue in determining                        the effect that emissions of volatile organic compounds                         have on air quality.  Completion of the preliminary phase                       outlined in this proposal is expected to provide the                            information that is needed to support a field study                             intended to assess the validity of the  model developed in                      this project.",
