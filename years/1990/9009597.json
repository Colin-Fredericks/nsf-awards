 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher will investigate conditions under which                     problems in structural design optimization map, without                         approximation, to linear programming (LP) problems, and to create               algorithms which exploit these special properties.                                   The conventional approach is to treat such problems as ones                in nonlinear programming (NLP).  For large systems, exact solution              of the resulting NLP problem is often intractable. It has been                  shown that a class of structural design problems can be solved much             more efficiently. The method requires solution of an LP followed                by a system of linear equations.  Solution of the LP identifies a               canonical structure which possesses the same displacement field as              the optimal structure.  This displacement field renders the                     equilibrium equations as a linear system in unknown areas, which                can be solved to yield the optimum design.  As a consequence,                   problems can now be solved of practical interest to civil and                   aerospace engineers several orders of magnitude larger than                     previously imagined.                                                                 The goal of this research is to extend the LP methodology to               encompass a more general class of structural design optimization                problems.  Initial numerical evidence indicates that the method is              extendable to displacement and frequency constraints.  In addition              to these constraints, buckling and multiple loads will be                       considered, and the researchers will define extensions of the                   method to structures discretized by continuum finite elements.                       If successful for this broader class of problem, the LP method             will greatly reduce the computational effort required for solving               these optimization problems, as a consequence of the need to solve              an LP rather than a NLP. Such a significant enhancement of                      efficiency will make optimization more attractive to structural                 designers.",
