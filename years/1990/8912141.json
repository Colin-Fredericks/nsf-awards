 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is an initial step toward developing                          synthetic polymeric sorbents that mimic biological binding                      mechanisms.  Proteins exhibiting multi-interactive mechanisms                   and competition at a particular site are selectively satisfied                  by those protein materials which most closely fit                               energetically a specific binding point.  The research will                      initially demonstrate a separating agent capable of                             selectively absorbing solutes that require mechanisms which                     utilize both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction.                                                                                                      To develop improved separating agents by mimicing nature                        requires a thorough understanding of relevant mechanistic                       interactions.  Although a large amount of information is being                  generated on how proteins bind to molecules, there is                           considerably less knowledge concerning solid-liquid adsorption                  mechanisms.  Thus, it is proposed to initially examine three                    binding mechanisms; hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions                  and charge transfer complexation.  Finally, in the later                        stages of the work it follows that these interactions will be                   coupled to develop separating agents which mimic biological                     binding.  To provide a better understanding of these phenomena                  as well as to permit the extrapolation of these results,                        appropriate thermodynamic descriptions have been developed.",
