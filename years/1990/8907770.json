 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for the purchase of a dedicated capillary                  gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (CGC-MS) instrument to                      facilitate research in biological chemistry conducted by five                   primary and five secondary user groups.  Complex mixtures of                    volatiles would be separated by capillary GC, ionized by chemical               ionization or electron impact, and analyzed by a computer-driven                acquisition system.  No current instrumentation is available on                 or off campus which could provide this hands-on analytical                      capability.  The instrument will be used in several major                       projects.                                                                                                                                                       1. analysis of pheromone metabolism in moths, for identification                of juvenile hormones, for isolation of novel juvenoids and                      antijuvenoids from insect tissues, and for analysis of                          metabolites of fluorine-and silicon-containing squalene analogs.                                                                                                2. separation of isotopically-labeled compounds from catalytic                  reactions with P-450 models.  3. to examine changes in membrane                 steroid composition which occur in antibiotic-resistant mutants                 of Dictyostelium discoideum.  4. in the identification of lupine                alkaloids in stressed plants.                                                                                                                                   Projects proposed by five minor users include 1. analysis of                    phenolic metabolites obtained from peroxidase action; 2. flash                  vacuum pyrolysis for analysis of nonvolatile molecules;                                                                                                         3. analysis of complex heterocycles in molecular recognition                    experiments; 4. development of new synthetic methods in                         asymmetric synthesis; and 5. analysis of facial stereochemistry                 in adamantyl derivatives.",
