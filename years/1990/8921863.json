 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Geoffrey Clark, Mr. John Lindly will                 analyze stone tools recovered from archaeological sites in                      Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran.  These materials are located in                 U.S. museums and Mr. Lindly will spend time working in each.  The               study will provide the data for his doctoral dissertation.                      Lithic materials from 17 sites, all dating to the Middle                        Paleolithic period, will be analyzed.  Mr. Lindly will focus not                on formal retouched tools but rather the debitage - the                         incidental by-products of stone tool production.  A number of                   measures and observations will be standardized and recorded and                 this will permit reconstruction of manufacturing processes used.                With this information it will then be possible to trace changes                 in technology across both time and space.                                                                                                                       The basic question Mr. Lindly wishes to examine concerns the                    development of anatomically modern humans.  Evidence indicates                  that during the Middle Palaeolithic the first such individuals                  appeared in the Near East.  Data also suggests that for many                    millennia these individuals coexisted with more archaic                         Neanderthal forms.  Mr. Lindly's study will determine whether two               technological traditions, which may then be associated with                     physical variants, also existed.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light into the origin of modern humans.  The analytic techniques                developed should also be useful in many archaeological                          situations.  Finally, the project will assist in the development                of an extremely promising young scientist.",
