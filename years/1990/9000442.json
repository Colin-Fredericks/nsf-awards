 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drill core samples from ODP Leg 115 demonstrate that aragonite                  cycles on the Maldives platform mimic changes in oxygen isotope                 values, and as found elsewhere, probably result from changes in                 dissolution and detrital input.  Furthermore, reconnaisance                     surveys have revealed that, in contrast to their asymmetry in                   the Bahamas, prograding clinoforms in the Maldive lagoons                       respond to the bi-directional, seasonal Asian monsoon.  Dr.                     Droxler has been awarded funds to participate on an                             international expedition to this area  aboard the French vessel                 Marion Dufresne.  Giant piston cores (up to 40 m long), water                   samples and high resolution echosounding and seismic profiles                   will be collected.  Back in Texas, Dr. Droxler and assistants                   will conduct preliminary studies including: 1) sedimentologic                   and isotopic analyses of selected core samples; 2) chemical                     analyses of hydrocast samples; and 3) processing and                            interpretation of 1200-1500 km of SCS data.  These latter data                  will be integrated with multichannel seismic reflection data                    collected in the 1970's by Elf Aquataine and made available to                  Dr. Droxler by his French colleagues.  His research goals are                   to: 1) match carbonate mineralogy to observed water chemistry;                  2) map thicknesses of Holocene sediments to guage offbank                       transport; 3) measure Pleistocene aragonite cycles and match                    them to known patterns of platform diagenesis; and 4) determine                 the response to Pleistocene sea-level changes.",
