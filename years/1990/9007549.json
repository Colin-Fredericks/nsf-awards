 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Botanical Society of America has arranged a half day                        symposium on the \"Physiological and Developmental Aspects of Gene               Action in Plants\". The symposium will be held at the annual                     meeting of the Botanical Society of America in Richmond,                        Virginia, between August 12 and August 16, 1990. This symposium                 represents part of the Genetics Section's effort to encourage                   communication on modern approaches (including molecular genetics)               to research in botany. The speakers are internationally known for               their modern approaches to problems in higher plants. All five                  are excellent speakers. They are leaders in their respective                    disciplines. Each speaker has agreed to participate. each speaker               will be given 45 minutes presentation time plus 15 minutes for                  discussion. The organizer (Phinney) will introduce each speaker                 and also summarize the overall purpose of the symposium to the                  audience. The speakers and the titles of their talks are as                     follows: 1) Tim Nelson (Yale University) \"Patterns of Development               in C4 Leaves\"; 2) Ian Sussex (University of Calif., Berkeley)                   \"Gene Expression During Meristematic Development\"; 3) Scott                     Poethig (University of Pennsylvania) \"Genetic Regulation of Phase               Change in Maize\"; Tom Guilfoyle (University of Missouri) \"Auxin                 Regulated Gene Expression\"; Judith Verbeke (University of                       Arizona) \"Cell Determination in Higher Plants\".                                 %%%                                                                             This symposium will be a valuable opportunity for botanical                     researchers to have access to some of the exciting developments                 in molecular genetic aspects of plant science that could                        directly affect their own research.",
