 "awd_abstract_narration": "A generic, \"hands-on\" control laboratory has been developed,                    built, and tested.  The laboratory uses control system hardware to              investigate undergraduate level topics in control theory.  A                    prototype system is being integrated into junior and senior level               control theory programs as laboratory courses.  Resources are made              available to fully equip the hands-on-control laboratory.  The lab              equipment includes both analog and digital controllers.  The                    digital controller is an IBM AT or Mac II, along with A/D and D/A               boards.  The purpose of the computer is to provide an easy medium               to implement a set of control instructions or algorithms into the               system at a high programming level.  The computer serves to                     acquire data, and graphically present the results.  Three                       experimental setups use an analog servo motor position controller               to demonstrate modeling techniques, sampling and observer design.               The generic laboratory set-up is designed to allow the                          investigation of a wide variety of processes such as motor                      control, a three-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm manipulation, an                inverted pendulum, and the control of temperature and tank water                level in a solar energy system.",
