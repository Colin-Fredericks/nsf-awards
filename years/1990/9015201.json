 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Program continues to support the research                 of Dr. William L. Jorgensen of the Department of Chemistry at                   Yale University.  His research is concerned with the                            interactive computer program, CAMEO, which is being developed                   to predict the products of organic reactions given starting                     materials and conditions.  The program uses mechanistic                         principles for broad classes of reactions to make its                           predictions.  The intent is for CAMEO to mimic the logical                      processes of a synthetic organic chemist as closely as                          possible.  Consequently, an important aspect of the project is                  to identify the logic and cast it in terms of fundamental                       organizing  principles governing organic reactions in addition                  to developing a tool to aid in the design of organic syntheses.                                                                                                 The classes of reactions that have been implemented cover (1)                   base catalyzed processes, organometallic reactions, ylide                       chemistry and organosilicon chemistry, (2) electrophilic                        processes involving carbonium ions as intermediates including                   electrophilic aromatic substitution, and (3) pericyclic                         reactions, i.e., cycloadditions, electrocyclic processes and                    sigmatropic rearrangements.  Improved treatment of heterocyclic                 chemistry is planned as well as new modules for the creation                    and reactions of carbenes, nitrenes, and free radicals.                         Standard oxidations and reductions of functional groups will                    also be implemented along with features to improve feedback to                  the user.",
