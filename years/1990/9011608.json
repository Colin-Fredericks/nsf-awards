 "awd_abstract_narration": "The observation of a number of recent studies that compensation                 demanded to sell goods or entitlements greatly exceeds willingness              to pay for them is inconsistent with standard economic theory, and              has become a key topic in experimental economics.  These                        discrepancies are surprising, because they occur even when the                  effects of strategic bargaining and other such economic factors are             eliminated.  Instead, those gaps appear to be rooted in the                     cognitive psychological processes people use in evaluating                      opportunities to buy or sell goods or entitlements.  The proposed               work will assess via laboratory experiments how discrepancies                   between willingness to pay and compensation demanded for risky                  alternatives varies depending on (1) whether opportunity for                    learning in an economic market-like setting is provided, (2) the                riskiness of the alternatives, (3) how the alternatives are                     described or framed, and (4) how willingness to pay and                         compensation demanded are elicited from buyers and sellers.                     Whereas previous studies have concentrated on whether these gaps                are real phenomena, we propose, and provide preliminary data                    supporting, a theoretical model based on Kahneman and Tversky's                 prospect theory which predicts wide variation in gaps depending on              factors such as 1 - 4.  These predictions will be tested in                     Experiments 1 - 3.  Experiments 4 and 5 will test prescriptive                  procedures using multiple perspectives, frames or reference points,             and modes of response in an attempt to induce convergence between               different measures of economic value, such as willingness to pay                and compensation demanded.  If the sizes of these buyer-seller gaps             can be reduced by decision support procedures of this sort, the                 overall quality of buyer - seller \"deals\" should increase.  More                broadly, it is hoped that the proposed work will help to bridge the             remarkably disjoint disciplines of experimental economics and                   psychology of judgment/decision making.",
