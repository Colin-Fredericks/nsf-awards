 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the distribution and abundance of species both               within and between communities has been one of the primary goals                in community ecology.  Although much research has focused on                    within community patterns, there has been a new emphasis on                     factors associated with regional distribution and abundance.                    Recently, Hanski (1982) proposed a dynamic regional distribution                model based on island biogeography from which he derived the                    core-satellite hypothesis.  The core-satellite hypothesis                       predicts a bimodal frequency distribution in which species tend                 to occur at all similar sights in a region (core species) or they               tend towards extinction (satellite species). This model contrasts               with others which predict a unimodal distribution of species in a               region.  This project will test the unique aspects of Hanski's                  model in comparison to other models (Levins 1969, Brown 1984) by                analyzing and adding to plant distribution data from the Konza                  Prairie Long-term Ecological Research Site.  General questions                  include: is the regional distribution of plant species bimodal?                 Do species shift from core to satellite categories and vice                     versa?  Does grazing effect the pattern of bimodality in plant                  communities?                                                                         Preliminary research indicates that prairie vegetation is                  dynamic over the short term, and that species regional and                      temporal distributions are bimodal as predicted by the core-                    satellite model.  This project will provide the first real test                 of this important model using spatial and temporal data, in                     combination with a large-scale field experiment from a single                   site.  A suite of plant surveys will augment long-term                          distributional data on prairie plants, and provide the primary                  basis for model testing.  Data generated as part of large-scale                 trails on grazing and fire disturbance will provide a unique                    opportunity to validate the model experimentally and test the                   role of intermediate levels of disturbance inustructuring plant                 communities.  Overall, this research has clear implications for                 understanding factors affecting the structure, dynamics, and                    distribution of plant species within and between grassland                      communities.",
