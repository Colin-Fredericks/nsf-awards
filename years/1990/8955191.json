 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project is designed to develop a statewide                      network of K-4 mathematics specialists in Kentucky. A series of                 four extended in-service seminars in the areas of number sense,                 geometry, measurement, and statistics, will be developed and                    field tested. The seminars will be designed to be consistent                    with the vision of the National Council of Teachers of                          Mathematics Standards, and will be disseminated widely.                         Regional teams of university faculty, school supervisors, and                   K-4 teachers of mathematics will develop and pilot the                          materials. These teams will also initiate inservice activities                  in their region with local support, with the intention being to                 prepare 240 mathematics specialists throughout the state to                     conduct school-level inservice using the project materials. The                 evaluation component focuses on changes in teacher beliefs and                  classroom practice resulting from project participation. All                    eight state universities in Kentucky are participating in the                   project.                                                                                                                                                        Cost sharing will be provided by the University of Kentucky and                 local schools as 38% of the NSF award.",
