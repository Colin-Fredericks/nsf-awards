 "awd_abstract_narration": "A useful approach to studying the processes that underlie visual                cognition is to study the errors that people make.  By examining                patterns of errors and the conditions that predictably cause                    them, it is possible to infer the principles that guide visual                  perception and memory.  Two lines of research will test the                     effects of viewers' general knowledge about the structure of                    naturalistic scenes on their ability to perceive and remember                   pictures.                                                                                                                                                       One series of experiments will examine a perceptual illusion that               occurs during high-speed presentation of pictures (e.g., 9/sec),                in which an object from one picture is frequently misperceived as               having occurred in the immediately preceding or following display               in the sequence.  The relationship of the object to the display                 in which it actually appears, and to those that surround it, will               be manipulated such that the object either will or will not                     conform to the observer's knowledge of real-world scenes.  The                  research will evaluate the effect of such manipulations on                      frequency of misperception.  The other series of experiments will               test a memory distortion that occurs when viewers try to remember               close-up photographs of objects.  Observers tend to recollect                   seeing information that was not present in the photograph, but is               likely to have existed just outside the camera's point of view.                 This suggests that general scene knowledge is important in                      understanding pictorial representation and that it alters memory                in a predictable and measurable way.                                                                                                                            This basic research on picture comprehension and memory has                     implications for visual communications (e.g., video displays,                   control panel design), particulary under conditions in which                    errors and brief delays may be crucial to avoid.",
