 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broken, disarticulated fossils record by their preservation state             the physical history of transport, reworking, and length of exposure            before final burial and preservation of the organisms.  Thus,                   taphonomic data (e.g., patterns of breakage and wear) are used as               paleoecological indicators of physical factors such as relative                 environmental energy and sedimentation rate.  Taphonomic data have a            second, separate significance for paleobiologists: they also reflect            underlying paleobiologic control (e.g., the mechanical strength of the          skeleton).  This second aspect of taphonomic information is only                beginning to be studied in a systematic way.  The purpose of this               research is to document patterns in:  (1) breakage/wear/damage of               exoskeletons and (2) the distribution of epibionts on fossil marine             invertebrates.  The goal of this work is to interpret these patterns            in terms of underlying paleobiological factors such as the mechanical           strength of the skeleton, predator/prey relationships, and life                 orientation of the organism.  Understanding the biological basis of             taphonomic patterns is necessary to accurately interpret the history            (e.g., the mode of formation) of fossiliferous assemblages.  This type          of research is a prerequisite for taphonomic studies that consider              fossils as sedimentary particles.  This initial study will examine              several genera of Late Ordovician trilobites from the Cincinnati arch           region.  Subsequent studies will focus on different taxonomic groups,           and the long-term goal is to compare the taphonomic patterns of this            fauna with faunas from other depositional settings and geologic                 periods.                                                                          The interactive component of this project includes the following:             a) primary teaching responsibility for an undergraduate course in               geology, b) participation in a graduate seminar in paleontology, c)             departmental guest lecture, d) a \"Women in Geoscience\" guest lecture            series, and e) various mentor/counseling activities.                              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
