 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McFadden's research will have two phases: (1) Laboratory                    analytical experiments simulating the effects of solar wind on                  asteroid surfaces and the way these changes affect spectral                     reflectance and other optical properties.  (2) Comparison of the                laboratory results with remote sensing data made with respect to                spectral reflectance and polarimetric and photometric scattering                properties.  This will define which of these parameters are                     diagnostic of solar wind bombardment and also define asteroid                   surface conditions whose specific spectral signatures are                       attributable to the effects of surface alteration.                                                                                                              Understanding the chemical and physical states of asteroids and                 their evolutionary history has been impeded by investigators'                   inability to satisfactorily compare remote sensing measurements                 with certain samples of meteorites and synthetic mixtures of                    terrestrial materials.  Dr. McFadden's study will examine the                   effects of solar wind bombardment on the reflectance and other                  optical properties of meteorite samples and mineral mixtures.  This             will improve the understanding of the relationship between                      asteroids and their possible meteoritic analogues, and test the                 current primary assumption in interpretation of asteroid spectral               reflectance: that the surfaces of asteroids are represented                     appropriately by unaltered meteoritic materials.",
