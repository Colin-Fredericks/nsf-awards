 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the effects of clathrate                             hydrate formation in reversed micellar solutions on the                         solubility and conformation of proteins.  Preliminary                           results show that hydrate formation can, under certain                          conditions, effect protein solubilization into micelles                         when conventional phase transfer methods prove                                  ineffective.  It has also been found that hydrate                               formation is a method of in-situ modification of micelle                        size, and  thereby, of protein conformation and enzyme                          activity.  Therefore a set of related studies is proposed                       that exploit these concepts to enhance protein extraction                       into reversed micelles, and recovery in appropriate form.                                                                                                       The use of hydrates to alter the catalytic activity of                          enzymes in reversed micelles is also proposed.  The                             phenomenon of hydrate formation in reversed micelles is                         essentially unstudied up to the present.  To a large                            extent, this research is phenomenological, and certain                          aspects are exploratory.",
