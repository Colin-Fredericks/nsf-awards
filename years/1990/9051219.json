 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates microcomputers and spectrophotometers into              four introductory biology courses. The Spectronic 20D                           Spectrophotometer is utilized to construct a standard curve,                    determine concentrations of bacterial cultures, produce absorption              spectra of plant pigments, study the relationship between light                 intensity and the rate of photosynthesis, and demonstrate enzyme                kinetics. The use of the computer enables the students to collect,              tabulate, manipulate, and graph data more accurately and                        effectively, leaving more time to interpret the data, perform                   statistical anaysies and draw conclusions. Computer-based tutorials             which supplement the laboratory material enable the students to                 study laboratory techniques such as pipetting, plating                          microorganisms, sterile technique, weighing samples, calculating                Rf values, using the spectrophotometer, constructing standard                   curves, and calculating dilution series. Software, such as that                 developed by Thornton and bioQUEST for problem-solving, data                    collection and data analysis, is being used in combination with                 hands-on experiences. The college is contributing an amount equal               to the award.",
