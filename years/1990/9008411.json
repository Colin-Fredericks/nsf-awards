 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central focus for research in science studies is the relationship             between experts and society.  This study will analyze the influence             of social science experts in encouraging democratic participation               in the formation and implementation of public policy.  To explore               this topic, secondary, archival, and oral history data will be                  examined in a qualitative historical study of social scientists                 employed in developing precursors to the U.S. \"War on Poverty\"                  Community Action Programs.  Alternative theories will be considered             in an analysis of the degree and nature of the impact of political              and other social forces on the activity of social science experts.              These theories will also be used to analyze conflicts in work roles             and assumptions of the social scientists in shifting from a                     \"scientific\" to a \"professional reformer\" model of expertise.  This             shift occurred during this period.  Other research questions focus              on the social scientists' conceptualization of community                        participation, the persons served by their actions, and the impact              those actions had.  The results of this study will expand our                   understanding of both the potential and limitations of the use of               social science experts in the promotion of citizen participation                in community reform initiatives.  Results will include a book                   manuscript and articles in refereed journals and other                          publications.                                                                                                                                                   This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional               support is very good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is                highly recommended.",
