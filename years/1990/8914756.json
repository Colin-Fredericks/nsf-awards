 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is provided to study the effect of pressure on low and                  intermediate temperature oxidation of C4 hydrocarbon fuels.                     The current project will continue and completeprevious NSF                      work and extend it to examine the effects of pressure in some                   detail.  An important and unique goal of this new program will                  be to develop and demonstrate in situ FTIR capability for                       monitoring stable and radical species.  Three separate and                      complementary bench scale experiments (a pressurized flow                       reactor, an atmospheric pressure flow reactor, and a static                     reactor) are available and will be used to examine the                          oxidation chemistry of hydrocarbons over a range of                             temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios.  Gas                           chromatography, GC/MS, and GC/FTIR will be used for chemical                    analysis of the stable reaction intermediates and products.                     In situ measurements of stable and radical species are planned                  using FTIR spectroscopy.  Specifically, the objectives are to                   (1) develop and implement techniques for making in situ                         measurements of concentrations of stable and radical species                    with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; (2) obtain                        kinetic information in the low and intermediate temperatures                    regimes (500-1000 K) over a range of pressures (up to 20 atm)                   for the oxidation of pure C4 hydrocarbons.                                                                                                                      This research will focus on developing and demonstrating FTIR                   capabilities and on    mechanistic studies using flow reactors                  with particular emphasis on pressure effects of hydrocarbon                     combustion.  Successful completion of the program will provide                  important new data and results showing the effects of pressure                  on hydrocarbon oxidation, and eventually, lead to a                             comprehensive understanding of fuel factors and physical                        effects in hydrocarbon oxidation systems.",
