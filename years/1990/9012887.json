 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes an ambitious investigation into connections             between corporate control activities (acquisitions, divestments),               commitment to innovation (research and development -- R&D), and                 performance measures (such as a decline in competitiveness).                    Acquisitions, for instance, take considerable corporate effort and              promote a short-run view.  In turn, this draws attention away from              longer-run emphasis on corporate R&D, which may make a firm less                competitive.  Similarly, corporate restructuring can lead to                    increased debt, which inhibits R&D commitments.  Although                       plausible, these ideas have yet to be addressed in the economics,               finance, or management literature.                                                                                                                              The principal investigators propose a combination of primary and                secondary data sources to provide insights into internal corporate              dynamics.  The primary data source will be based on a large-scale               survey of almost 1000 companies, with detailed interviews at 30                 companies.  The secondary data source will involve analysis of                  longitudinal records available from COMPUSTAT and other sources.                The integration of these two data sources offers the opportunity                to gain theoretical and empirical advances in understanding                     corporate response to restructuring.",
