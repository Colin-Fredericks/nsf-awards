 "awd_abstract_narration": "When humans use language, they show an essential responsiveness                 to their hearers.  When language is automatically generated, it                 is similarly necessary to ensure that language is appropriate for               its intended audience.  Much previous research in computational                 linguistics has focused on building user models and selecting                   information from a knowledge base to present to the user.  It is                important, however, that the phrasing of a text be also tailored                to the hearer - otherwise it may be just as ineffective as texts                which rely on knowledge the hearer does not have.  The                          realization that situations systematically affect language can                  greatly help the tailoring process:  given appropriate                          classifications of situation-types, the consequences of these                   situations on language can be specified, and suitable language                  can be produced.  In a pilot study that involved generating                     explanations for an expert system tailored to three user types,                 previous work has shown that is is possible to specify the type                 of language required in a given situation and to build a text                   planning system that uses that specification to control phrasing                of its text.  This research will extend that work.  The goal is                 to create a framework within which it is possible to gain                       systematic control over phrasing by designing methodologies and                 mechanisms by which the systematic relationship between                         situations and language can be found, represented, and used to                  tailor generated texts.",
