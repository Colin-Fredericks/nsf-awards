 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neural system controlling avian song has proved a                      powerful model for elucidating hormonal influence on neural                     organization and behavior.  Song is an androgen-dependent                       behavior produced predominately in males.  Sex differences in                   song behavior are mirrored in the anatomy of brain regions that                 control song.  Neuron size and number, androgen binding activity,               and the projections of song-related brain regions are all much                  greater in males than in females.  The striking anatomical                      dimorphisms result from differences in exposure to gonadal                      steroids during development.  Dr. Nordeen will use sophisticated                anatomical techniques to examine how gonadal steroids act on                    developing song regions during the first few weeks after                        hatching.  He will determine how hormones regulate the                          production, migration and/or survival of neurons within these                   specific brain nuclei.  These experiments will provide insights                 into the cellular mechanisms of sexual differentiation.  Possibly               the most exciting contribution resulting from work on this model                system is the recognition of the plasticity of the brain during                 development and in adulthood.  A major outcome of these studies                 will be to increase our understanding of those mechanisms that                  permit aspects of neural plasticity and thus, may eventually                    prove important in developing treatments for enhancing the                      recovery of function in humans that have been incapacitated by                  accidents or strokes.",
