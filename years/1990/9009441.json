This project is to collect, analyze, and interpret the                          technical and hazard mitigation data related to the                             performance of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in                          response to the Loma Prieta Earthquake.                                                                                                                         The collected performance data will be applied to the                           improvement of the \"SEAOC/CALBO Joint Unreinforced Masonry                      Technical Strengthening Provisions.\"  These provisions have                     been recently approved by the Structural Engineers Association                  of California (SEAOC) as a submittal for inclusion in the                       Uniform Code of Building Conservation (UCBC).  If approved by                   the International Council of Building Officials they will                       provide unified design criteria for the hazard mitigation of                    URM buildings                                                                                                                                                   This data base can provide valuable improvements to these new                   provisions in the form of additions, clarifications, and                        changes necessary for their effective implementation.  These                    improvements will be formulated to provide the related                          supplementary commentary and example applications.                                                                                                              This project will make an important contribution to the                         improvement of seismic code provisions.",
