 "awd_abstract_narration": "A severe decline in landings of haddock (Melanogrammus                     aeglefinus) in the northeastern U.S. has resulted in prices                     similar to those of salmon, and market reliance on imports.                     This creates an opportunity for haddock culture in Maine,                       utilizing the facilities already in place for salmon                            aquaculture. The suitability of haddock for net-pen culture                     will be determined by seeking answers to the following                          questions: 1) Is the growth rate of haddock on artificial diets                 comparable to that of salmonids; 2) Are modified salmonid net-                  pens suitable for rearing haddock; and 3) Can haddock and                       salmonids be reared together.  Adult haddock will be captured                   during spring 1990 and transported to modified salmon net-pens                  in Eastport, Maine.  There growth on different diets will be                    measured and adaption to the net-pens and interaction with                      salmon assessed.                                                                     Production of haddock in Maine would allow net-pen growers                 to compete with those in Europe, where commercial culture of                    other whitefish is likely in the next few years.  Maine-grown                   haddock could provide an alternative to the current imports of                  wild haddock from Iceland and Canada.",
