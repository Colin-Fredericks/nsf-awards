Dispersal is likely to influence strongly the                   information and persistence of zooplankton patches.  Dispersal                  will be analyzed with several measures including the net                        horizontal displacement of individual zooplankton over a                        specified time.  Experiments will be conducted in large field                   enclosures (10,000) using the natural assemblage of plankton.                   Recent studies indicate that physical factors alone can not                     explain all of the of the observed small scale patchiness.                      However, very little is known of the influence of biotic factors                                                                                                                                                                                (ie. interactions with other animals or food) on patchiness.
