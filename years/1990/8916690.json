 "awd_abstract_narration": "During our present NSF-supported research, we have                         documented a very large fluvial system (probably the ancestral                  Indus River) that flowed ESE across the Potwar Plateau of                       northern Pakistan from 12 Ma to at least 6 Ma. Isochronous strata               from this time interval thicken and coarsen dramatically toward                 the northwest and suggest that the Indus previously entered the                 Northwest Himalayan foreland across the Kohat Plateau.  Whether                 the Indus flowed toward the ESE from here during the late Miocene               or whether this was actually the apex of a large mega-fan (as has               been postulated) is presently unknown.  Similarly, whether or not               the large-scale lithofacies changes seen in the Siwalik molasse                 of the Potwar Plateau represent responses to switching of the                   primary course of the Indus rather than major tectonic events in                the Himalayan hinterland is also unresolved.  Answers to these                  questions are critical keys to understanding the long-term                      evolution of this major depositional system in an active                        foreland.  In the absence of additional time control and of more                extensive stratigraphic data from the Kohat Plateau, however,                   these problems cannot be resolved.  We propose to develop seven                 new magnetic stratigraphies in judiciously selected location.  On               this supplementary chronologic database and that derived from                   Khan's (1983) previous studies, we will integrate sedimentologic                observations that will enable us to reconstruct the fluvial                     system of the southern Kohat Plateau and Trans-Indus region in                  order to resolve these problems.  In addition, by extending the                 same isochronous surfaces that we have studied in the Potwar                    region, we will be able to synthesize these two complimentary                   data sets and examine virtually the entire western segment of the               Indo-Gangetic foreland across northern Pakistan for the past 12                 Ma within the most precise and geographically extensive time                    framework available for a terrestrial sedimentary basin.",
