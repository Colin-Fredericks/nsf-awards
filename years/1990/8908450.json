 "awd_abstract_narration": "New surfaces that mimic biological membranes will be created by                 covalent binding of phospholipid monolayers at high densities to a              rigid, insoluble silica particle.  A series of unique solid-phases              denoted as \"Immobilized Artificial Membranes\" (IAM) will be                     synthesized and extensively characterized.  These IAM will be                   evaluated for:  1. their usefulness as HPLC separation matrixes for             biological macromolecules; and  2. as model biomembranes for the study          of integral membrane protein function.  Hydrophobicity of the IAM will          be varied via three approaches:  a. controlling the hydrophobic depth           of the lipid monolayer;  b. bonding lysolecithin containing one alkyl           chain in contrast to bonding lecithin with two alkyl chains;  c.                covalently anchoring carboxyl groups attached to hydrocarbon spacers            at the surface and at various depths within the IAM hydrocarbon core.           Membrane fluidity and surface properties will be modified by inserting          mobile lipids within the layer of immobile phospholipids anchored to            the rigid core.                                                                                                                                                 IAM mimicking the lipid environment of the cell membrane are to                 provide separation media with a surface uniquely suitable for the               purification of highly functional biomolecules which are difficult or           impossible to purify by existing methods.   The ability of IAM to               purify several classes of molecules is likely, including integral               membrane proteins (enzymes), peptides, receptors and oligonucleotides.          IAM will further be evaluated as model systems to reconstitute and              study the membrane-bound enzyme cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase.                 Ultimate goals include the design of improved models of functional              biomembrane bilayers and highly specific membrane-bound peptide                 sequences for selective purification of recombinant proteins.",
