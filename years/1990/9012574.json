 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the utility of immunoaffinity adsorption on the                         laboratory scale, it has had little application in large-                       scale downstream processing of therapeutic proteins                             because available support matrices have poor mechanical                         properties and immunoaffinity ligands are costly and                            often deactivate upon exposure to elution conditions.                           Recently available microporous hollow fiber membranes                           suitable for bioprocessing promise advantages of high                           throughput rates and short residence times that may                             preserve the useful lifetime of labile ligands.  The                            potential of these materials in immunoaffinity                                  separations is untested and principles for design and                           scaleup undeveloped.                                                                                                                                            The goal of this research is to develop a fundamental                           understanding of the phenomena that determine the                               performance of microporous immunoaffinity membranes in                          protein separations.  Membranes will be activated and                           used to bind three ligands for further study:  Protein A,                       which binds to most immunoglobulins, and two monoclonal                         antibodies - anti-bovine serum albumin and anti-Factor                          VIII.                                                                                                                                                           The immunoaffinity membranes will be fully characterized                        in terms of physiochemical properties.  Measurements will                       be made of (1) ligate adsorption and elution breakthrough                       curves, (2) equilibrium and reaction rate parameters, (3)                       axial dispersion coefficients, and (4) ligand and ligate                        localization within the membrane.  A theoretical model                          will be developed, validated by comparison with                                 experimental data, and used in simulations to explore                           design and optimization.  The ability of bound ligand to                        retain functional activity will be explored with                                successive adsorption-elution cycles using automated                            equipment.",
