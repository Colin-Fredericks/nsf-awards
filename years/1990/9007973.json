 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Philip Kohl, in a collaborative project with Russian                        archaeological colleagues, will lay the groundwork for a long-                  term archaeological research project in the Transcaucasia region                of Southern Russia.  The team will examine what are essentially                 uninvestigated remains which include large fortified Bronze and                 Iron Age hilltop sites and burial mounds.  Archaeological                       deposits from earlier Mesolithic and Neolithic periods will also                be examined.  Sites will be mapped using aerial techniques and                  surface materials collected.                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  First, although                the Transcaucasia area is known to be rich in archeological                     remains, very little systematic work has been conducted.  This                  project will help to fill that gap.  Secondly, because of its                   richness in raw materials such as obsidian (volcanic glass) and                 metals which were widely valued in prehistory, this area probably               played a major role in the development of complex Old World                     societies, and research here will shed additional light on                      prehistoric development over a broad geographic area.  Finally,                 Dr. Kohl's work should help to solidify ties between U.S. and                   Russian archaeologists and open the way for future collaborative                research.",
