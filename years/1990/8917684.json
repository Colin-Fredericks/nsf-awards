 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichoptera (\"caddisflies\") represent a significant                        component of many stream and terrestrial habitats.  Their egg                   cases are important factors in the flow of nutrients through                    stream ecosystems, and they are used as environmental quality                   indicators.  Dr. Ralph Holzenthal proposes to complete a Manual                 of the Trichoptera of Costa Rica.  This effort would entail                     further field collecting at sites that represent the major                      habitat types (moist- and dry-forests on both the Caribbean and                 Pacific sides, plus montane sites), description of scores of new                species, preparation of species' lists, identification keys, and                an illustrated manual (published in Spanish with English text                   made available separately).  The Manual Project will also allow                 two employees of the Costa Rican National Biodiversity Institute                to acquire advanced training in Trichoptera taxonomy and ecology,               and will produce a comprehensive systematic reference collection                for future in-country research.                                                      The proposed caddisfly inventory of Costa Rica will have                   broad implications beyond insect systematics.  At an                            organizational level, the project sets a new standard for                       international collaboration, training of in-country                             practitioners, and construction of systematic reference                         collections.  At the level of applied research, the manual will                 be invaluable for ecological studies and environmental quality                  assessment.  At the level of pure research, the project will                    advance our understanding of a diverse tropical insect group, and               will lay the foundation for future studies of evolution and                     biogeography in the tropics.",
