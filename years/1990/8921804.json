 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will continue, and expand upon, their previous                     modeling studies of the tropical oceans and atmosphere.  A major                focus will be the development of an improved atmospheric heating                parameterization, taking into account the distinct processes                    operating within and above the boundary layer.  This will be                    aided by existing and planned diagnostic studies based on                       observed (or analyzed) winds, as well as GCM calculations.                           Their Pacific coupled model will be extended to the Atlantic               and Indian Ocean sectors, first individually, and finally as a                  coupled model of the global tropics.  This will include                         parameterizations of land-atmosphere interactions that have thus                far been ignored.  They will seek to identify the extent and                    nature of climate variability that arises from local interactions               within each oceanic sector, and the manner in which inter-basin                 interactions modify or enhance that variability.                                     The new parameterizations will be incorporated into a multi-               level, global atmospheric model.  Both linear and primitive                     equation versions will be developed.  Explicit boundary layer                   physics will permit a more realistic representation of the actual               oceanic forcing, and allow for a relatively inviscid free                       atmosphere, in contrast to their previous model.  Long-term                     coupled simulations with this model will be used to study the                   mechanisms of low frequency climate change in the tropics.                           This research project is important because it will shed                    more light on the role of the coupling between global oceans and                the atmosphere on climate variability.",
