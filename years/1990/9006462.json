 "awd_abstract_narration": "Food web theory predicts a series of relationships between                 the species richness (number of species) of a natural assemblage                and the stability of species abundances in time.  In spite of the               importance of food web dynamics to both basic and applied issues                in ecology, few of these predictions have been tested                           experimentally.  This project will first assemble replicated food               webs of protozoans that differ in species richness, connectance                 (number of species interactions in an assemblage) or number of                  trophic levels.  These webs will then be used to evaluate the                   persistence and temporal stability of communities with and                      without small perturbations in nutrient levels.  These enrichment               experiments are very important to improve the knowledge base of                 fertilization effects in nature, an area of great concern as a                  result of the nutrient loading associated with global change.  In               another set of experiments, the effects of species richness will                be determined in the laboratory relative to the persistence and                 variability of species.  A final group of trials will examine                   whether the degree of connectance in food webs affects their                    stability, and whether stability decreases as food chains                       increase in length.  Although these experiments will be done on                 assembled communities in the laboratory, ancillary studies will                 employ similar approaches to explore whether natural protozoan                  communities collected from the field will perform similarly to                  those constructed artificially.",
