 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ample evidence from petrographic and geochemical studies                   supports the hypothesis that fluid movement in sedimentary basins               has a significant control on chemical diagenetic processes.                     Computer models allow reconstruction of basin paleohydrology and                allow prediction of chemical reactions and mass transfer, but                   computational requirements of integrated models of chemical                     reaction-fluid flow normally result in one or other part of the                 calculations being overly simplistic.  The proposed research                    involves integrating the results of separate paleohydrologic and                chemical predictions to constrain diagenetic pathways in                        sedimentary basins.                                                                  The approach is to use results from a completed study of the               paleohydrologic evolution of the Gulf of Mexico basin to                        constrain temperatures, pressures, gas fugacities, and fluid:rock               ratios in calculations of mineral-pore water interactions, which                will be made using the EQ3/6 software package.  Preliminary                     results show that predicted diagenetic sequences for Lower                      Tertiary Gulf of Mexico sandstones are in close agreement with                  sequences determined petrographically.  Calculations of volumes                 of minerals precipitating and dissolving show that most                         modifications occur during early diagensis or immediately after a               change in paleohydrologic regime.  Proposed research will involve               the further investigation of these preliminary results, including               construction of hypothetical diagenetic pathways in several                     common hydrologic settings and will include a thermodynamic                     evaluation of the role of organic acids in enhancing mineral                    solubilities and the prediction of isotopic compositions of                     minerals and pore waters in each diagenetic pathway.                                 Results from this research will improve our understanding                  of chemical diagenesis in sedimentary basins in general, and the                Gulf of Mexico basin in particular, and will provide important                  guidelines for the development of combined chemical reaction-                   fluid flow computer algorithms and the interpretation of results                from such calculations.",
