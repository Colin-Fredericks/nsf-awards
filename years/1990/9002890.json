 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of an experimental study of the first onset               of dissipation in the flow of superfluid 4He through an orifice                 of micron or submicron dimensions as the rate of flow surpasses a               critical threshold.  Measurements will be made of the magnitude                 of the critical rate of flow and its dependence on temperature,                 pressure, and shape of orifice and of any statistical rounding of               the onset as a function of temperature, in order to gain                        information about the fundamental processes involved, for which                 no satisfactory model now exists.  Use will be made of a small                  mechanical resonator capable of resolving single-quantum-vortex                 events in the oscillatory flow of superfluid through an orifice                 that is fabricated by means of electron-beam lithography and ion-               beam milling or reactive plasma etching.  Studies will be made                  using both a single-hole configuration and a closed-loop                        configuration analogous to an rf-biased superconducting quantum                 interference device.",
