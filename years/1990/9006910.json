Recently mixed                                                    integration and modal synthesis                                                 techniques have been proposed to                                                more efficiently perform the                                                    dynamics analysis and to reduce the                                             computational cost.  These                                                      developments are at an early stage                                              and substantial work still to be                                                done, most notably in the                                                       implementation of various                                                       theoretical schemes to exploit the                                              vector and parallel processing                                                  capabilities of the new computer                                                systems.                                                                                                                                                        This research project deals with                                                the implementation of finite                                                    element mesh partitioning, the use                                              of independent operations in each                                               partition, and the determination of                                             the response of the complete                                                    structural system utilizing these                                               operations.  Only direct                                                        integration will be employed, since                                             these are more readily applicable                                               to nonlinear problems.  A Newton-                                               Jacobi mixed integration approach                                               will be study in detail and                                                     implemented on vector and parallel                                              processors.",
