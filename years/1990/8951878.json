It is being funded under the Instrumentation and               Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                     improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by                        supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                 undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science,                       mathematics, or engineering.  In particular, the main objectives                of this project are curricular innovation and delivery in                       calculus and undergraduate numerical analysis courses.  Three                   groups of courses will be affected: (1) a twelve-hour, three-                   semester calculus sequence for mathematics, engineering, and                    physical science majors, (2) a six-hour, two-semester calculus                  sequence for business administration and social science majors,                 and (3) a one-semester numerical methods course required of all                 engineering freshmen.  Software (with an emphasis on graphics)                  especially developed for classroom demonstrations will be used.",
