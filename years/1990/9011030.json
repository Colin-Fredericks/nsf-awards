 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major ecologically important group of marine animals are the                  jellyfish, or cnidarians.  They form a major part of the drifting               animals living near the ocean surface, and different species show               different selection of prey animals on which they feed.                         Jellyfish capture their prey animals by using the stinging cells                (cnidocytes) in the tentacles only when the prey comes into                     contact with the jellyfish.  So the observed selective feeding on               either fish or crustaceans requires some sensory mechanism for                  the jellyfish to distinguish prey.  This study will use modern                  neurophysiological techniques of patch-clamping on the stinging                 cells, and address the important question of whether there is                   some chemosensory regulation of release of the stingers.  The                   impact of this Career Advancement Award will enhance Dr. Jennifer               Purcell's career capability significantly, and results will be                  important to chemosensory science, animal behavior, neurobiology,               and marine biology.",
