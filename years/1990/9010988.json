 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Mr. Craig Klyver, the Southwest Museum                   will catalog and conserve the anthropological papers of Frank                   Hamilton Cushing and Frederick Webb Hodge.  Both played active                  roles in the development of American anthropology and the                       documentation of traditional Southwestern Native American                       cultures.  Cushing conducted both ethnographic and archaeological               research in the late 1800's and was a pioneer in new methods of                 ethnological investigation.  He lived and worked among the Zuni                 people over an extended period of time and was one of the first                 participant/observer ethnographers.  Based on this original work,               he later returned to the Southwest as a Smithsonian Institution                 staff member to conduct archaeological research in a attempt to                 understand the development of the patterns he observed.  Hodge                  was also a Smithsonian staff member who first accompanied Cushing               and then later undertook extensive publication of his findings.                 Together the Cushing and Hodge photographs, letters, manuscripts,               and other documents cover 30 linear feet.  Because many of these                materials are fragile and poorly catalogued they are not readily                available to researchers.                                                                                                                                       With National Science Foundation support the Southwest Museum                   will provide proper storage, repair damaged items, and take steps               to preclude further deterioration of these collections.  The                    materials will be catalogued on ARGUS, the museum's computerized                collection management system.  On-line access to documents and                  photographs in the collections will be available to other                       ARGUS-user institutions.  In addition, the materials will be                    microfilmed and copies deposited with the National                              Anthropological Archives, the Museum of the American Indian, and                the Zuni Tribal Archives, as well as the Southwest Museum.                      Printed indexes and finding aids will be generated, and the                     original materials conserved and housed in proper containers.                                                                                                   This project is important for several reasons.  It will preserve                documents which contain significant scientific information and                  make them more readily available to researchers.",
