 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in the foundations of mathematics is:                   Which set existence axioms are needed in order to prove specific                theorems of ordinary mathematics?  Here \"ordinary mathematics\"                  refers to the parts of mathematics which are not overtly set                    theoretical.  For instance \"ordinary mathematics\" includes                      subjects such as geometry, differential equations, real and                     complex analysis, countable algebra, countable combinatorics, and               the topology of complete separable metric spaces.  On the other                 hand, \"ordinary mathematics\" does not include topics such as                    general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic.                                It has been found that the language of second order                        arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study of the above                 question.  (This is because \"ordinary mathematics\" is to a large                extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.)                  Moreover, a great many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when               formalized as sentences of second order arithmetic, turn out to                 be equivalent to the set existence axioms which are needed to                   prove them.  (The equivalent is proved over a weak base theory.)                Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms                   which arise in this way is rather small.  This is the theme of                  Reverse Mathematics, which has been developed by Simpson and                    others and will be further developed under the current project.",
