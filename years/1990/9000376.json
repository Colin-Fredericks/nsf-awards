 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in the theory of matroids                 of Professor Klaus Truemper of the University of Texas at Dallas.               Dr. Truemper's project is to develop new methods of matroid                     decomposition, and also to apply the body of matroid theory to                  the task of producing an algorithmic problem solver or program                  generator that will, in most cases, produce highly efficient                    solutions to particular problems in a given NP-hard class.                           This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
