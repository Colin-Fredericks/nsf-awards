The joint study will be focused on three major                                  topic areas: (1) probabilistic modeling of                                      dynamic forces utilizing the current data base                                  of earthquakes, winds, floods, slides, etc.                                     recorded and accumulated in both countries,                                     (2) intelligent buildings - an emerging                                         research subject of significant impact                                          potential to future civil engineering                                           practice, and (3) field testing of                                              geotechnical-structure systems utilizing field                                  experimental facilities planned for advance                                     dynamic testings.                                                                                                                                               The research will be conducted at the National                                  Taiwan University through joint workshops and                                   field investigation.  The effort is expected                                    to synthesize the current knowledge and                                         practices, assess the future research needs,                                    and develop cooperative projects between the                                    two countries.
