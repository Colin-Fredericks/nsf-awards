 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes electronically instrumented laboratories as            part of a plan to more closely integrate laboratory demonstrations and          experiments with the classroom instruction of engineering mechanics.            New and interesting experiments and demonstrations are incorporated             into the curriculum so as to create an engaging laboratory environment          and encourage student interest in engineering mechanics. Courses are            affected in the sophomore, junior and senior years.  The equipment              purchased is a computer controlled data acquisition system.  This               system enables progressive instruction in methods of modern data                acquisition and culminates in a senior laboratory project in which the          students must plan and implement an electronically instrumented test of         a non-traditional construction material.  The award is being matched by         an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
