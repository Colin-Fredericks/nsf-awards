 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has acquired a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer                 which is being used throughout the college's chemistry program,                 beginning with introductory Organic Chemistry.  The instrument is               central to the new junior-level laboratory course, in which                     students do several extensive projects, each of which is                        instrumentally oriented and modeled on original, published                      research.  The equipment is also playing an important role in                   student-faculty research project in organic synthesis in progress               in the Department.                                                                                                                                              More than half of the students who graduate from Swarthmore                     College with a major in Chemistry or Biochemistry go on to                      careers in scientific research.  The principal goal of the                      Department of Chemistry is to provide these students with the                   best possible experimental training for such a career.  A crucial               component of this preparation is the hands-on use of modern                     instrumentation in the context of chemically interesting                        laboratory projects.  The addition of experience in gas                         chromatography/mass spectrometry is significantly enriching the                 education of this very talented group of future scientists.                                                                                                     The Department of Chemistry is publishing a description of their                new junior-level lab course with the expectation that is will be                a useful model for the chemistry curricula of other institutions.                                                                                               The institution has matched the NSF award with an equal amount of               funds.",
