 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a multifaceted study of a fossil fauna comprising                  about 200 species of marine bivalve mollusks that occupied                      southern Florida prior to the recent ice age and that suffered                  heavy extinction during the ice age.  This fauna is spectacularly               preserved in shell beds exposed by quarrying at Sarasota.  PI is                mapping the shell beds over a large area.  Using information                    about habitats of surviving species and the physical nature of                  the shell beds, PI has concluded that the beds represent a                      complex of barrier island (or spit) and lagoonal environments.                  Further work will allow testing of hypotheses as to how the                     unusual vertical sequence of shell beds developed.  The fauna is                the tropical component of a large marine fauna that occupied the                entire East and Gulf coasts of the U.S.  Components of the fauna                from northern Florida to Virginia are well studied.  Completing                 the picture by studying the tropical component will enable me to                investigate geographic patterns of extinction and migration                     during the ice age.  To this end, PI will complete a species-                   level taxonomic study of the south Florida fauna, using general                 museum collections, his own collections, and type specimens--and                employing morphometrics where appropriate.  The precise age                     traditionally assigned to the fauna has recently been questioned.               PI will attempt to resolve the issue using radiometric dating of                fossil corals and biostratigraphy based on mollusks and                         microfossils.",
