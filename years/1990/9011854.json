 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will span areas of mathematical                       research in partial differential equations to studies on the                    mathematical principles underlying of mechanics and                             thermodynamics.  Included in this effort will be the analysis of                ground states for nonlinear operators.  These are solutions                     of second order elliptic partial differential equations of                      divergent type which become small at infinity.  The equations not               only have physical significance, but also occur naturally in                    geometric studies involving mean curvature of surfaces and their                generalizations.  Although ground states are known to exist in                  many classes of equations, it is not known whether or not any                   exist having finite energy.  Work will continue studying this                   question.                                                                            On the foundational level, studies will focus on the                       principal axioms of classical mechanics relative to the balancing               of linear and angular momenta.  The independence and                            reasonableness of these axioms will be challenged through the                   introduction of a modified axiom system in which neither of the                 main balance axioms is postulated and in which inertial frames                  are not required.  Instead, a point of view in which the                        invariance of power or generalized work, or the invariance of                   balance of thermodynamic energy, should imply the balance of                    momentum, will be taken.                                                             Another line of investigation continues an extensive study                 into one of the primary open questions of thermodynamics: the                   existence and uniqueness of entropy for a given thermodynamical                 system.  Only in irreversible processes is this unclear - even                  existence can be in doubt.  A particular application to this                    research would be to that of a compressible Navier-Stokes fluid                 where entropy is only verifiable under an additional hypothesis                 of fiberings of the flow.",
