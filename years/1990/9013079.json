 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental study will be performed to investigate algorithms for           problems concerned with computation of network flows, including the             minimum cost flow problem and possibly restrictions such as the                 maximum flow problem, the shortest path problem, or the assignment              problem.                                                                                                                                                        The experimental study will proceed as a cooperative competition among          members of the research community.  Participants will submit code for           evaluation or will perform specific experiments at their home sites.            The competition will culminate in a workshop where participants will            describe their results; the best implementations for several input              classes and computing environments will be identified.                                                                                                          Competitors will generate a large amount of data about the                      performance of these algorithms.  Parametric and nonparametric methods          of data analysis will be applied to obtain quantitative descriptions            of performance as a function of input parameters.  Some particular              results to be obtained include:  analysis of the relationship between           running time and standard combinatorial measures of performance;                identification of input properties that are \"hard\" for certain                  algorithms; and development of realistic random models of networks.             Besides providing substantial new knowledge about the performance of            these algorithms, the project will also give insight into experimental          methods for algorithm analysis and into the viability of using                  computer research networks in such cooperative projects.",
