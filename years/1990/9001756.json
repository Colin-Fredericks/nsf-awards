 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appoaches to acquiring problem-solving knowledge have focused on                achieving general results with simple problem domains.  These                   domains have had small search spaces, few subgoal interactions,                 and only Boolean constraints.  Real-world application domains                   have many subgoal interactions, large search spaces, and real-                  valued performance constraints as well as Boolean constraints.                  SteppingStone is a new general learning problem solver for                      solving difficult real-world problems.  SteppingStone solves                    these problems by decomposing them into simpler subproblems, and                then learning to deal with the interactions that arise between                  them.  An initial version of our approach demonstrates this in                  the classical tile-sliding domain.  This work will extend the                   system and demonstrate its capability in real-world problem-                    solving situations such as VLSI design and job-shop scheduling.                 By experimenting with both classical problem-solving domains and                real-world aplications it will demonstrate that the problem                     solver is both powerful and general.",
