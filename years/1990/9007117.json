 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of species has been a central question in                       evolutionary biology ever since Darwin.  Despite our great                      advances in knowledge about natural selection and adaptation                    within a species, there still remains much controversy  over the                meaning of species, the mechanisms by which new species                         originate, and the genetic  basis of the traits responsible for                 defining a new species.  The investigators propose to study these               issues with male calling song in the Hawaiian cricket genus                     Laupala.  There are currently 37 recognized species in this                     genus.  The species tend to look alike, but they differ greatly                 in the time interval between sounds in the male calling song.  It               has been proposed that male song is used by females to identify                 potential mates.  If true, male song would be important in                      defining the species boundaries of these crickets.  They will                   test this hypothesis by using molecular genetic survey techniques               to define populations of crickets that share similar genes.  They               will then see if genetically similar populations also share a                   common song.  With the same molecular data they will also                       reconstruct an evolutionary tree of all the species.  This                      evolutionary tree will allow them to estimate how the songs have                evolved between species.                                                                                                                                             These molecular data  will also be used to test the                        hypothesis that the rate of DNA evolution is accelerated when a                 new species arises on a different island than its ancestor, as                  has been found for Hawaiian fruit flies (Drosophila).  These data               will also be used to test the hypothesis that differences in song               among local populations within a species promote genetic                        differentiation.  Finally, because they can successfully cross                  species in the laboratory, they will study the genetic basis of                 the song differences between species using traditional breeding                 analysis as well as modern molecular techniques to map and                      identify genes.  This last study will not only allow them to                    address the evolutionary question of the types of genetic                       differences that arise among a species, but it will also a direct               comparison of the traditional versus molecular approaches to                    genetic analysis:  a comparison  that is relevant to many                       applications in the health sciences.",
