 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to study the design, fabrication, and                                characterization of the 8-12 u long wavelength infrared                         (LWIR) sensing element of image sensor cell, which is                           composed of one GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW)                         photoconductor and three modulation doped field effect                          transistor (MODFET) switches, controlling the cell's                            charging, output, and reset, respectively.  The critical                        issue is how to make the mesa structures of the MOW                             photoconductor and the planar structures of the MODFET                          compatible.  BAsed on our new invention of the                                  integration of MQW photocondutor and FET structures,                            the patent of which is being applied, the design and                            fabrication procedure of a monolithically integrated                            image sensor cell is proposed.  The success of the                              project is crucial for the development of the                                   monolithically integrated GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum                          well imager, which is a two dimensional focal plane                             array of sensor cells combined with the signal readout                          circuits.  The development of the monolithic long                               wavelength IR multiple quantum well image sensor                                represents an important goal, not only in the thermal                           imaging technology, but also int he innovative                                  application of superlattices.",
