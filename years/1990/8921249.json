 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children represent one of the most impoverished groups in                    America today, with roughly one fifth living in households                      with income below official poverty guidelines.  Less well                       appreciated is that poverty rates among rural children are                      even higher.  Unfortunately, poverty today is viewed as a                       fundamentally urban problem, which is reinforced by media                       attention to a highly visible urban \"underclass\" in the                         nation's cities.  Our reliance on national statistics, which                    are heavily weighted in favor of urban areas, often masks the                   extent and causes of economic hardship in America's                             nonmetropolitan and rural areas.  Drawing upon a variety of                     census and survey data, the primary objective of this                           research is to examine geographic variation or spatial                          inequality in the economic status of American children over                     the 1959-88 period.                                                                                                                                                Specifically, this research seeks to identify the primary                    economic and demographic sources of area-to-area differences                    in the poverty status of American children.  Is the rise in                     child poverty due to changing family structure and increases                    in female-headed households?  Or, is child poverty located                      primarily in the deteriorating employment conditions                            experienced by children's parents?  More important, how do                      these sources of economic hardship and inequality among                         children vary over time and geographic space?  The common                       view that child poverty is located in changing family                           structure may be inappropriate for rural areas, where                           children typically live with both parents.  In rural areas,                     the deteriorating economic status of rural children may                         instead be rooted primarily in the income-generating                            abilities of parents, which have been negatively affected                       during the 1980s by a stagnating rural economy.  Clearly, an                    accurate understanding of spatial disparities in child                          poverty today requires some sensitivity to the alternatively                    reinforcing and counterbalancing effects of changing family                     structure and economic conditions in rural and urban areas.",
