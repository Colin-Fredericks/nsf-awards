 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Limnology's Trout Lake Station provides access to                a region with one of the densest concentrations of lakes in the                 world.  Aquatic systems there range from temporary ponds to large               lakes and represent a broad diversity of hydrologic, edaphic,                   and trophic conditions.  Most of these systems lie within                       protected watersheds with low population densities.  The                        diversity of these resources has led to an extensive history of                 aquatic research at the station.  Early work began with the                     pioneering comparative investigation of Birge and Juday and was                 expanded upon by the whole-system experiments conducted by                      Hasler.  Current programs at Trout Lake include several                         multi-investigator, ecosystem level investigations as well as                   numerous smaller-scale projects involving population and                        community ecology, hydrology, fisheries biology, and basic                      limnology.  Research activities at the station have undergone a                 major expansion over the past decade.  This expansion has been                  coupled with a program to provide major improvements in both the                physical plant and the research capabilities of the station.                    This support will continue improvements in both of these areas.                 Specifically, it will support the acquisition of major instrument               systems (an autoanalyzer and a particle analysis system) which                  will augment substantially the basic analytical capacities of the               station.  Additionally, a new four-season cabin will complete the               planned expansion of basic facilities.  These improvements will                 further basic goals of fostering the use of the Trout Lake                      Station as a national and international center for aquatic                      research.",
