 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of new tunable, and solid state lasers such as                         Ti:Sapphire, external cavity diode laser, laser diode pumped                    Yag, YLF and a host of other lasers, have created new laser                     configurations that would require high frequency mode                           locking devices to produce picosecond mode locked laser                         pulses.                                                                         The purpose of this study is to propose selecting LiNbo3 as                     the most efficient high frequency acousto-optic mode locking                    resonator for active mode locking of these new lasers.                          Lithium Niobate crystals from Japan and China have                              improved qualities, and may have more desirable optical and                     acoustic properties, and we are among the first in the U.S. to                  obtain such crystals.  We have further proposed a unified                       theory on high Q acoustic resonators such that all interacting                  parameters can be analyzed simultaneously, and calculate                        parameters such as the instantaneous power, optimum                             resonator length, etc. in relation to the drive power.                          Based on the analysis to be developed in this project, we will                  then demonstrate a 500 MHz (for 1 GHz laser cavity) high                        Q liNbo3 acoustic standing mode locking device with a closed                    loop phase detection to monitor the mode locker resonant                        frequency by controlling the temperature of the mode locker.",
