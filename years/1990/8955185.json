 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a unique opportunity for 84 selected elementary                 teachers (of grades K-6) from 42 schools in five counties in                    Southeastern Ohio's rural Appalachian region to become Lead                     Teachers (LTs), as well-trained and educated in science and                     mathematics.  This project will enable them to become change                    agents who will target the mathematics and science problems                     within their own schools by working with their principals and                   fellow teachers to develop school-based action plans to improve                 all teachers' skills, implement those plans, evaluate their                     effects, help project staff revise the program model and assist                 with its dissemination in the region.  They will work toward a                  program which will reduce the problems which limit elementary                   pupil achievement and contribute to poor attitudes toward                       mathematics and science.  The design of the participating schools               will become effective leaders in their own schools, capable of                  effecting change among their students, their peers and in their                 school.                                                                                                                                                         The LTs, many whom have been identified by fellow teachers and                  principals for their outstanding teaching and leadership                        qualities, will participate for three full years.  Three 4 week                 summer workshops stressing the content, activities and                          methodology of science and/or mathematics will be supplemented by               very specific leadership activities designed to enhance their                   capabilities to effect change.  These summer workshops will be                  held on the campus of Ohio University with members of the                       science, mathematics and education faculties cooperating to                     provide the expertise.  Academic year seminars will reinforce the               content of the workshops as well provide the opportunities for                  teachers and staff to share their experiences and plans for                     school-based changes.                                                                                                                                           Cost-sharing from the University, the Ohio Department of                        Education and the five county schools is equivalent to 105% of                  the NSF request.  This is a strong indication of the enthusiastic               endorsement and support of the participating institutions.  There               is excellent assurance that continuing support for the intent of                the project will be forthcoming in future years.",
