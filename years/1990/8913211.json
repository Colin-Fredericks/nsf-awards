The DUPC houses the largest and most diverse collection                of prosimian primates in the world.  In addition, the DUPC has                  the largest number of endangered primates housed at a single                    institution.  The DUPC operates as a research resource, providing               animals, tissues, and blood samples to scientists on a local,                   regional, national, and international level.  In-house research                 is conducted by several staff members, as well as visiting                      scientists, graduate students, post-doctoral students, and                      permanent faculty members.  In the last few years, due in part to               the growing strength of the DUPC collection, research on                        prosimians has increased in scope, intensity, and sophistication,               and is now one of the most active and exciting fields of                        primatology.  However, prosimian primates are not a renewable                   resource.  The captive propagation of prosimians has become a                   necessity in order to underwrite continued research on this                     fascinating and little-known group of primates.  The DUPC is the                only university-related research facility in the world devoted                  exclusively to the study of prosimian primates.",
