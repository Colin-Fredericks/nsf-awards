The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Jolinda A. Traugh,                   will support a 12-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr.                      Elizabeth Mandley to the United Kingdom to work with Dr.                        Michael Whitaker of the Department of Physiology of the                         University of the City of London, on \"Cyclin Destruction in                     Meiotic and Early Mitotic Cell Cycles of Sea Urchins                            (Xenopus).\"  The investigators propose to investigate the                       mechanism of cyclin destruction during the M-phase of the                       rapid cell cycles of early sea urchin development.  Cyclin is                   only unstable during M-phase, and preliminary evidence                          implicates a regulatory cascade of protein phosphorylation and                  desphosphorylation in the process.  Some evidence suggests                      calcium may be involved in the destruction process.  Cyclin                     destruction can be triggered in a cell-free system prepared                     from Xenopus eggs by addition of active cyclin/p34-cdc2                         complex.  Destruction requires ATP and the participation of                     both soluble and particulate material.  This suggests that                      the high molecular weight multifunctional protease and hence                    ubiquitin may be involved.  The investigators will investigate                  whether cylcin degradation involves ubiquitin by searching                      for ubiquitinated intermediates of cyclin, and by fractiona-                    tion.  They will also investigate the role that calcium plays                   in the destruction process.  More generally, they will                          attempt to purify and identify as far as possible the                           components of the destruction system.                                                                                                                           The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
