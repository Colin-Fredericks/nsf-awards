 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an ongoing collaborative project on the                 topic of high resolution electron beam studies of hydride compounds,            with Dr. Patrick Herley, State University of New York at Stony                  Brook and Dr. W. Jones, Physical Chemistry Department, University               of Cambridge, England.                                                                                                                                          In recent studies of the solid state properties of light-metal                  hydrides, borohydrides and alanates, these investigators have                   shown that nanometer sized metallic particles can be produced in                situ in the electron microscope by beam decomposition.  Such                    particles are of considerable research interest because theoretical             work indicates that, as the size of a metal or metal oxide                      particle decreases, unusual magnetic, electronic and optical                    behavior should result.  This research effort has produced                      lattice images with atomic resolution of oxide-free copper and                  aluminum microparticles approximately 2-5 nanometers in diameter.               Such particles are important commercially in the electronics                    industry as surface coatings and pastes for use in thin-device                  contacts in the manufacture of denser microcircuits.  Likewise,                 high quality, electron-transparent single crystals of the alkali                metals have been prepared and their plasmon spectra have been                   probed using electron-energy-loss spectroscopy.  The importance                 of understanding the exact correlation between particle size and                such properties as crystal perfection and surface electronic                    properties at an atomic level on catalytic activity cannot be                   overemphasized.  This award will enable Dr. Herley to continue                  productive interaction with Dr. Jones and to use the unique High                Resolution Electron Microscope facilities at Cambridge for these                studies, which they propose to extend to other important metals,                for example, silver, zinc and cadmium.",
