 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the context of a very large knowledge base which consists of                 rules and the extensional database of facts, the major problem is               how to process the relational operations on the extensional                     database in the minimum amount of time to satisfy the user                      queries. To speed up the relational operations on very large                    knowledge bases, parallel processing is essential. But most of                  the previous index schemes and file structures were designed for                sequential processing environment, so they can not be easily                    mapped to parallel processing systems. One reasonable indexing                  scheme for parallel processing systems is the concatenated code                 word (CCW) surrogate file which has small size and simple                       maintenance requirement.  The CCW surrogate file can be used to                 index the rules as well as facts, and relational operations can                 be directly performed on the CCW surrogate files.  CCW surrogate                files can be mapped well into the parallel architectures because                their structure is quite compact and regular.                                                                                                                   The main goal of this research work is to develop optimal                       clustered CCW surrogate file and data file structures suitable                  for parallel processing systems.  Parallel relational operation                 algorithms based on the clustered file structures that are                      designed in this project will be evaluated and their performance                compared with other knowledge base management systems.  The                     efficient index and file structures developed for very large                    knowledge bases support parallel relational operations used in                  logical inference mechanisms, thus making these systems more                    effective.",
