 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molluscs are a group of commercially valuable species found                notably in coastal and nearshore areas which include the clam                   and snail families.  Because of the decline in harvest of many                  of these valuable species, basic research which attempts to                     explore which environmental variables are most important in                     regulating the success and distribution of these species is of                  significant interest.  This research by Dr. McDowell of the                     Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will explore the role of                     strontium and salinity in regulating the growth and development                 of molluscs.                                                                         Salinity has traditionally been thought to play a major                    role in structuring both benthic and planktonic estuarine                       communities.  Whereas this may be true for many invertebrate                    organisms, recent evidence suggests that the development and                    survival of molluscan embryos may be limited more by the                        concentration of strontium in seawater than by the capacity to                  maintain homeostasis under salinity stress.  Two pieces of                      information have led to this deduction:  1) as a conservative                   element in seawater, strontium concentration should convary                     with salinity, and 2) strontium is required for a brief period                  near its oceanic concentration during embryonic mineralization                  of shell of all molluscs tested to date.  It follows that                       molluscs must have evolved mechanisms for maximizing the                        potential for exposure of their embroyos to high strontium                      levels.  These investigators will conduct laboratory experiments                designed to disentangle the effects of salinity stress and the                  requirement for strontium during molluscan development.  The                    objectives of this study are the following: 1) to determine the                 strontium dose-response curves for embryonic shell formation as                 a function of salinity in four molluscan species representing a                 range of habitats and requirements for formation of mineralized                 tissues, 2) to compare the strontium dose-response curves to                    the capacity of embryos and larvae to volume regulate over                      ontogeny, and 3) to compare strontium levels with embryonic                     development in field-collected seawater.  The study represents                  the first attempt in delineating how the stringent requirements                 for strontium during embryogenesis may have influenced                          evolution of present-day distributional patterns of molluscan                   populations.",
