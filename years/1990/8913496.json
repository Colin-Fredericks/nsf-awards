 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is the photochemistry of metal                 complexes adsorbed on porous Vycor glass. The colored compounds                 of such transition metals as ruthenium absorb light to form                     excited state molecules, which then undergo a variety of                        chemical reactions, such as electron transfer or bond cleavage.                 Both the reaction dynamics and the products which are formed                    are quite different in the pores of the glass than in                           solutions. In some cases the absorption of light causes the                     formation of charge-separated states of the sort needed for                     practical solar energy conversion.                                                                                                                              The reasons for the differences between the photochemistry of                   transition metal complexes in Vycor glass and in solution will                  be explored. The effects of using mixed ligand complexes, of                    changing the glass environment and of changing the assembly of                  reaction sites will be investigated. The nature of the surface                  acceptor sites responsible for electron conduction along the                    glass surface will be explored, and laser flash photolysis                      experiments will be performed to determine the dynamics of the                  secondary thermal and photochemical reactions which follow the                  primary photoprocesses and account for the differences in                       behavior in the glass and in solution. A particular emphasis                    will be placed on elucidating the sequence of steps leading to                  catalytic intermediates, and on the factors which control the                   aggregation and distribution of metals and metal oxides on the                  glass surface.",
