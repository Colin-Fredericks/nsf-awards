The objectives             are to include (CIM) projects within Computer Graphics and                      Manufacturing as well as to offer a new course titled, \"Computer-               Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM).\"  This new course is                  designed to familiarize the students with computer-aided design,                numerical control, computer process control, robotics, group                    technology and computer-integrated manufacturing.  The major                    equipment selected includes a robot, a CNC lathe, and a milling                 machine along with a workstation, personal computers and                        appropriate software.  This project provides the opportunity for                students to work with modern equipment and \"state-of-the-art\"                   software in an important area of manufacturing.                                                                                                                 The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
