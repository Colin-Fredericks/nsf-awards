 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at the                   University of Washington for the purchase of 8 nearly identical                 computer stations for physiological data acquisition and                        processing.  These units will be used in a variety of courses from              elementary to advanced, as well as in undergraduate research.  The              principal pedagogical goal is to enhance the technological                      sophistication of students, and to inculcate an appreciation for                a facility with quantitative approaches both to original data and               to its conceptual interpretation.                                                                                                                               The Department appreciates the use of computers in a tutorial                   context, in modelling, and in providing partial substitutes for                 experimental work on live tissues.  The programs available for                  these applications are growing in number, variety and quality and               the PI plans to make increasing use of them.  However, the main use             of the instruments would be directly in the laboratory, interfaced              to a variety of recording devices and transducers for measuring                 electrical activity of nerve and muscle, mechanical properties of               muscle, gas concentrations, temperature, etc..  Students would                  acquire the data, write them to disk, and perform analyses that far             exceed anything that can be taught with present instrumentation.                Students would thereby acquire a far richer appreciation of the                 dynamic workings of living organisms as well as become                          sophisticated in methodologies that have wide application in                    science generally.  The grantee is matching this award with non-                Federal sources.",
