 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing plant embryos have the capacity to germinate or to                   mature. Dr. Rivin is investigating how embryo abscisic acid                     level, hormone sensitivity and changing water relations modulate                the expression of these two developmental potentials. Her goals                 are to define, at the molecular level, the developmental pathways               that are modulated by these physiological cues during maize                     embryo maturation, and to identify the genetic mechanisms that                  regulate their expression. To address this problem she will                     follow a three part program that involves both molecular and                    genetic approaches, focussing on mutants that fail to develop                   successfully through maturation phase. The specific objectives                  are the following: 1) Identify cDNA clones of mRNAs that are                    specific to embryo maturation, using her previous observations                  about the synthesis of maturation phase polypeptides in wild type               and viviparous mutants as a basis for selection of co-regulated                 message sets. 2) Measure the expression of maturation mRNAs                     during normal maize embryogenesis and examine how this program is               altered when development is disrupted genetically in viviparous                 and defective kernel mutants, or by manipulation of physiological               factors in tissue culture. 3) Search for new transposon tagged                  embryo lethal mutants to collect additional loci for genetic                    dissection of embryo maturation, and to provide a means of                      cloning genes essential to embryo development.                                  %%%                                                                             In flowering plants the developing seed creates a morphologically               complete embryo which goes on eventually to germinate. Embryo                   development takes place in two stages, the second of which is                   termed maturation. This project is aimed at an understanding of                 the factors that control this maturation process.",
