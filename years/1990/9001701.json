 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in Plio-Pleistocene hominid paleontology over the                 past four decades has focused largely on exploration and recovery               of fossils and artifacts from sites in East Africa.  All five                   known australopithecine sites in southern Africa were discovered                between 1924 and 1948; no new locality has been found in over                   forty years.  In order to appreciate the course of early hominid                development beyond that represented in East Africa, and in order                to gain a more precise picture of chronological relationships, it               is critical that additional fossiliferous localities be                         discovered in southern Africa.  Plio-Pleistocene sediments in                   southern Africa are represented by breccia-filled caves within                  the limestones of the Transvaal System.  The purpose of this                    project is to undertake a systematic, exploratory survey of the                 outcrops along the eastern escarpment of the Transvaal System for               fossiliferous breccia caves, and to identify sites for future,                  long-term excavation.  The chances of finding such a rewarding                  site may not be high, but the extreme value to anthropology if                  such a site is found makes this exploration a most worthwhile                   risk.",
