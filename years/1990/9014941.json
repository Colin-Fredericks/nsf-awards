 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the                    Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical studies of organic chemical reactions both in the                   gas phase and in solution using a combination of quantum                        mechanics, statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics                         simulations.  The results of this theoretical research provide                  an important interpretation of chemical reactivity at the                       fundamental molecular level of understanding.                                                                                                                   Jorgensen employs ab initio molecular orbital calculations to                   provide energy surfaces for reactions in the gas phase and                      potential functions that describe solute-solvent interactions.                  The effect of solvation is then determined by computing the                     free energy surfaces in solution.  This involves Monte Carlo or                 molecular dynamics simulations for the reacting systems plus                    about 300 solvent molecules in a periodic cell.  Finally, the                   reaction dynamics are studied by trajectory calculations that                   are started in the transition state regions.    These                           computations provide detailed information on key issues                         including the reaction mechanisms in the gas phase and in                       solution, the existence of intermediates, the origin of solvent                 induced activation barriers, changes in solvation along                         reaction paths, energy redistribution during reactions, and the                 dynamic role of the solvent in determining reaction kinetics.",
