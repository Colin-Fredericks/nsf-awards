 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will use quantitative methods to discriminate                tectonic from eustatic components of sea level change during                    deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems of North America and                     Northwest Europe.  Techniques to be used include (1) quantitative               tectonic subsidence analysis, back-stripped with corrections for                compaction, sediment load, paleodepth and sea level change, (2)                 calculation of tectonic plate stress and its effect on sea level                change, and (3) determination of the present-day elevation of                   Pennsylvanian shoreline sediments so as to identify Pennsylvanian               paleo-sealevel on a stable reference datum.  New criteria of the                preserved position of sea level (so-called \"sea level markers\")                 in coastal sedimentary rocks are available now to constrain the                 range of such determinations.  Paleodepths can be identified from               this datum by measuring the decompacted thickness of vertical                   sequences of shoreline facies.  The decompacted thickness of                    barrier island and tidal flat vertical sequences provides a                     numerical estimate of the magnitude of eustatic change in sea                   level, and will be used to make the eustatic sea level correction               for tecotnic subsidence analysis.  Expected results include                     determining the exact present-day elevation of Pennsylvanian sea                level, and the numerical magnitude of both eustatic and tectonic                components of Pennsylvanian sea level change.  The approach to be               tested herein can then be used to make similar determinations of                eustatic and tectonic controls on sea level in sedimentary rocks                representing other periods of earth history.",
