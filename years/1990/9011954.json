 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Professor Sarunas Milisauskas, Mr. Hugh                  Jarvis, a graduate student at SUNY Buffalo, will conduct field                  and laboratory research to collect data for his doctoral                        dissertation.  As part of a larger archaeological project, he                   will address the question of how late prehistoric hunters and                   gatherers adapted to harsh desert-like conditions.  Over a decade               of research in the Zeekoe valley of South Africa has provided an                excellent data base which maps approximately 16,000 lithic                      scatters which are the result of prehistoric activities.  On this               basis archaeologists have attempted to reconstruct human use of                 this landscape and document how it changed over time.  In                       particular they wish to know how human groups were organized.                                                                                                   Mr. Jarvis will examine this question through the analysis of                   hornfel, a locally available mineral which was used to make stone               tools.  Hornfel outcrops are widespread within the valley and                   preliminary work indicates that many are chemically distinct.                   Mr. Jarvis will conduct an extensive geological collection                      program and use neutron activation analysis to distinguish among                sources.  He will then similarly characterize stone tools from a                number of archaeological sites.  A comparison of tools to sources               will provide a basis to determine how people moved over and                     subdivided the landscape and, thus, elucidate social                            organization.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of how groups at simple technological levels                  adapt to harsh and unpredictable environments.  It will also help               to develop a general technique which should prove useful in a                   wide variety of archaeological situations.  Finally, it will                    assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
