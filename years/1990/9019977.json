 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will carry out two initiatives in support of                  the research activities of the Long-Term Ecological Research                    Network (LTER).  Specifically, these initiatives are acquisition                of remote sensing imagery for each of the LTER research sites,                  and for the installation and development of a system to enhance                 connectivity of the LTER Network.  The remote sensing acquisition               will provide a consistent and comparable database for                           collaborative research within LTER as well as providing a                       historical record for future research.  This acquisition will                   provide a common database for LTER as well as the larger                        ecological community associated with LTER research.  The remote                 sensing initiative requests digital satellite, and hard-copy                    aircraft imagery for each of the LTER research sites.  The                      connectivity initiative will enhance communication within and                   beyond the LTER Network and will be fundamental for future                      database management activities.  This initiative is seen as a                   first step in connectivity efforts within LTER as recommended in                the LTER Connectivity Report.  The connectivity initiative will                 support the installation and development of a computer                          communication system for mail and data exchange, which will be                  accessible via wide-area networks, by members of the LTER Network               as well as outside researchers working with LTER.  This system is               envisioned as a major link for information exchange not only with               LTER, but also for the larger ecological community.",
