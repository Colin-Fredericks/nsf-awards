 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will focus on problems arising in the                 theory of orthogonal polynomials.  These are polynomials in one                 complex variable which are orthogonal with respect to some                      density (measure) defined on the complex plane.  Particular                     emphasis will be placed on those measures which are supported on                bounded sets.  The setting is more general than the study of                    polynomials defined on a circle.  It is motivated by studies of                 the Schrodinger equation and dynamical problems which have led to               polynomials orthogonal on Julia sets and on spectral questions                  concerning Jacobi matrices with unbounded or periodic entries                   which are orthogonal on several intervals.  The latter questions                emerging from statistical physics.                                                   Two primary goals in the work involve the location of the                  roots of orthogonal polynomials and analyzing certain asymptotic                relationships involving successive roots of polynomials as their                degrees increase.  The method to be employed involves a potential               theoretic approach by which asymptotics are measured by the                     Green's function for the support set.                                                Other work will involve Pade approximation and weighted                    polynomial approximation in Lebesgue spaces defined on plane                    regions.",
