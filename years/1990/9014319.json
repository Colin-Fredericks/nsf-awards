 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three year pilot project will be implemented that will                   focus on increasing the presence of minorities in computer                      science.  This will be done by developing and testing an                        information system to enhance both the recruitment of minorities                for computer science graduate programs and the interaction among                minorities already in computer science as graduate students or as               professionals.  The information system will be on-line and                      accessible to other universities via networks.  It will contain                 data such as students' personal data, financial support                         mechanisms, contact persons, description of graduate program in                 computer science, personal data will be obtained from a select                  group of colleges/universities, including CIC (Committee on                     Institutional Cooperation plus the University of Chicago), along                with 10 institutions with predominantly minority students.                      Faculty, counselors, administrators, and students from Michigan                 State University will serve as a pilot group for the proposed                   system on a vax computer system and use the database, INGRESS.                  Also, workshops are planned in order to obtain feedback from the                project participants, including outside evaluators.",
