 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rieffel's project involves a synthesis of ideas                  from differential geometry and the theory of operator algebras.                 He will study from several viewpoints the process of deforming                  geometric structures by passing to an algebra of functions or to                a Lie algebra and then smoothly changing the multiplication.                    Specific subjects of investigation include quantum groups,                      deformation quantization, and Yang-Mills theory.                                     Fundamental to Rieffel's work is the notion that certain                   algebras of operators can profitably be viewed as noncommutative                analogs of familiar geometric objects.  One might for instance                  begin with the two-torus, the surface of an inner tube.  All of                 the information about the shape of this object is contained in                  the algebra of complex valued functions on it.  Two such                        functions are the ones that measure phase as one goes around the                torus the long, respectively the short, way around.  These                      functions generate the algebra of continuous functions on the                   torus in a certain universal way.  Replace them by two (unitary)                operators, a species of generalized functions, that instead of                  commuting when multiplied, commute only up to a phase.  As the                  phase varies, the operator algebras generated by these                          projectively commuting unitaries form a family of noncommutative                tori, creating a setting in which geometric ideas can be                        formulated and studied without reference to a geometric object in               the usual sense.",
