 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of approximately ten young                U.S. polymer scientists in a joint workshop with potential                      collaborators from the Federal Republic of Germany.  Several                    industrial participants are expected, at their own expense.  The                meeting was co-organized by Dale S. Pearson of the University of                California at Santa Barbara and Edwin L. Thomas of MIT together                 with Joachim Wendorff of the German Plastics Institute, Darmstadt,              and Hans Kricheldorf from the Department of Applied and Macro-                  molecular Chemistry,  University of Hamburg.  The workshop will be              held in a small village near Cologne, and will conclude with a tour             and panel discussion at the new Max Planck Institute for Polymer                Research at Mainz, FRG.  This is a major new facility which                     indicates the strong interest of the German government and scientific           community in polymer science.  Prior bilateral meetings in this                 field (over three years ago and with different participants)                    resulted in a number of joint research projects, publications and               arrangements for sabbaticals in Germany and the U.S.  The small                 size of the meeting is particularly conducive for initiating close              professional relationships among people who have not had an                     opportunity to meet before.                                                                                                                                     The primary objective of the workshop is to address critical areas              of polymer science through a well balanced program that includes                contributions from chemistry, physics, materials science, and                   engineering.  Presentations will be about evenly divided among                  polymer synthesis and modification, polymer characterization, and               polymer theory.  Particular emphasis will be given to two areas:                synthetic research on electroactive polymers, a topic that has                  fostered intense collaboration between the physics and chemistry                communities, and the more general but rapidly expanding area of                 polymer theory.  Advances in theoretical concepts coupled with the              increased availability of supercomputers are having a major impact              on the way polymer scientists view macromolecular behavior.  In                 addition, the participants will review progress in several areas                included in previous meetings, such as liquid crystalline polymers,             self-organizing systems, and polymer interfaces and surfaces.  German           research in polymer dynamics and surface characterization is among              the best in the world due to their excellent facilities for neutron             and X-ray scattering studies and some top-notch people.",
