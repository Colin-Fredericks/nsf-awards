The                                            emphasis will be on interfacing many                                            parallel data streams into a single                                             optical fiber using two-dimensional                                             surface-normal architectures.  This                                             addressed vertical cavity surface-                                              emitting laser and spatial light                                                modulator arrays.  The initial                                                  emphasis in this program will be on                                             dense time-division multiplexing and                                            demultiplexing at a specific center                                             wavelength, by means of arrays of                                               spatial light modulators.  Further                                              efforts will be aimed at pipelining                                             several such sets of time-                                                      multiplexed data into a fiber using                                             wavelength-division multiplexing.                                               Physical device models and global                                               Monte Carlo simulations of complete                                             systems will be used to study the                                               properties of various architectures,                                            for comparison with experiments.                                                At the end of three years the                                                   investigators will have developed a                                             working prototype system for time-                                              division multiplexing of ten data                                               channels timed and recovered by                                                 using interleaved gain-switched or                                              mode-locked picosecond pulse trains                                             and phase mudulator arrays.  An                                                 important element of this scheme                                                will be the development of optical                                              coincidence detectors for time-                                                 division demultiplexing, based on                                               arrays of bistable etalons or                                                   thresholding optical detectors.  The                                            principal investigators also will                                               have assessed the feasibility of                                                combining several groups of time-                                               division multiplexed data at                                                    different wavelengths, using arrays                                             of single-mode edge-emitting and                                                surface-emitting lasers, and arrays                                             of spectrally matched detectors.",
