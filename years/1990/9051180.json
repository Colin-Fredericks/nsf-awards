 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Shannon Point Marine Center is developing innovative programs in            undergraduate teaching and student research in marine science, for              students at Western Washington but also students from local community           colleges. Revisions in the Marine Algae course emphasize ecological             physiology and experimental phycology by the application of modern              techniques to study the biology of marine plants. Radioisotopes and             fluorometry are being used as tools to study organic carbon, nutrient,          and energy cycles as well as algal biomass and growth. The Marine               Ecology course is applying radiotracers to study feeding and energy             transformation in invertebrates. Workshops are being run to train               community college faculty and students, WWU science majors and                  independent study students in the use of radioisotopes and fluorometry          as tools in scientific investigation of marine systems. The university          will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
