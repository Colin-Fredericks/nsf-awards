 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will make a major contribution to                            understanding lifetime reproductive success in birds (LRS).  An                 understanding of LRS is essential for understanding how natural                 selection alters the nature of birds over evolutionary time.  In                order to do this work it is essential to establish the precise                  parentage of offspring.  This will be accomplished with a                       technique that is also used in human parentage determination --                 DNA fingerprinting.  The proposed work will assess parentage                    among members of a focal population and integrate these findings                with existing calculations of LRS.                                                   This work is also of importance to the conservation of                     shorebirds -- many of which are endangered or threatened.                       Shorebirds are of increasing concern to conservationists for two                reasons: (1) many share common breeding habitat with waterfowl, a               group for which there is intense single-purpose management, and                 (2) shorebird populations are highly vulnerable as the birds                    migrate to and winter in areas of the world where shoreline                     habitats are undergoing explosive development.  Knowledge of                    population dynamics and reproductive output, therefore, is                      essential for the making of wise conservation decisions.",
