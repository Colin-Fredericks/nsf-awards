The liquid sources will                                            be used as a replacement for silane,                                            phosphene, diborane and methane.  We                                            plan to use infrared absorption                                                 spectroscopy, continuous wave                                                   emission and picosecond                                                         time-resolved photoluminescence                                                 spectroscopy, time of flight                                                    measurements, and photoconductivity                                             techniques to characterize the films                                            prepared under a variety of                                                     deposition conditions.  The                                                     liquid sources together with the                                                magnetically confined microwave                                                 produced plasma are expected to                                                 deposit high quality films at very                                              high growth rates (>10A/s).  We are                                             already getting interesting results                                             on intrinsic and carbon doped films                                             deposited in a linear system.  Our                                              ultimate goal is to improve the                                                 quality of the films by varying                                                 various deposition parameters (e.g.,                                            microwave power, magnetic field, gas                                            pressure, substrate temperature,                                                etc.)  This will finally improve                                                the quality of the devices made from                                            these films.  Another goal is to                                                reduce the toxic and explosive risks                                            associated with present film                                                    deposition techniques.",
