 "awd_abstract_narration": "About thirty-five years ago H. Lewy produced an example of a               first order linear partial differential equation with linear                    (complex) coefficients which had no solution.  A complete                       description of differential operators which are 'solvable'                      remains a challenging, but unresolved issue in mathematical                     analysis.  However, the search has led to many fundamental                      results about partial differential operators, especially in the                 context of the theory of several complex variables.                                  One of the more interesting aspects of the work in this area               concerns the question of describing the range of an 'unsolvable'                operator, or, equivalently, which inhomogeneous equations can be                solved?  The question is reformulated in terms of the null space                of the adjoint: whether the projection operator onto the null                   space preserves real analyticity.  The tools used to investigate                the question in this project involve the calculus of                            pseudodifferential operators defined on a manifold, the                         Heisenberg group.  Work will be done on the specific case of the                Szego projection restricted to a real analytic boundary of a                    bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type in two complex                       dimensions.                                                                          Work will also be done investigating specific one-parameter                families of differential operators of second order to determine                 conditions under which they will be analytic hypoelliptic and on                pseudodifferential operators defined on general nilpotent Lie                   groups.",
