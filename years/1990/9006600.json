 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI seeks support for an investigation of a novel                       technique to quantify the changes in intracellular concentrations               of calcium that are associated with the activity of hippocampal                 neurons involved in learning and memory.  Specifically, calcium-                sensitive fluorescent dyes will be mircroinjected into selected                 neurons and monitored using a dual-wavelength spectrofluorimeter                and scanning confocal microscope following manipulation of                      neuronal activity, such as high-frequency tetanus to produce long               term potentiation.  The proposed research is a gamble and there                 is a minimum of preliminary data to allow an easy judgement.                    However, the investigators have made excellent progress in                      analyzing calcium changes in cultured cells.  The difficulty is                 in extending these procedures to the tissue slice.  The potential               for a significant outcome seems sufficient to justify the risk.                 The ability to make high-resolution measurements of calcium                     changes in hippocampal neurons will have an impact on many areas                of neuroscience, including computational psychology, neural net                 modeling, and electrophysiology.  This work has the potential to                move neuroscience significantly closer to an understanding of the               synaptic molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.",
