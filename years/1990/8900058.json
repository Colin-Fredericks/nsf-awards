 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three techniques have been used for measurements of hydroxyl               radical (OH) concentrations:  laser induced fluorescence (LIF),                 the direct, long path absorption (LPA) method, and the 14C tracer               method.  To be usefully applied to atmospheric measurements,                    detection systems must be sensitive enough to measure low OH                    concentrations, must gave reasonable signal-to-noise ratios, and                have the capacity to discriminate against chemical and physical                 interferences.  They must be absolute or susceptible to                         calibration.  Attainment of these goals must be feasible under a                variety of environmental conditions.                                                 This research project will evaluate the potential to measure               local diurnal OH concentration cycles to a precision of 20                      percent using integration times of 100 seconds.  Calibration of                 the method is not required.  14C method, in collaboration with                  other groups measuring significant trace gas concentrations in                  the atmosphere, to make careful checks on the validity of current               models of tropospheric photochemistry.  Some intercomparisons of                OH measurements with those of other techniques, using                           scientifically defensible protocols, and the collection of                      preliminary statistics on temporal and spatial variability of OH                near ground level will also be carried out.",
