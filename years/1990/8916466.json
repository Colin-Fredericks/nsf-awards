 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms possess genetic variation for enzymes                       involved in basic metabolism, but the functional significance of                this variation is poorly understood.  The investigators are                     examining the function of enzyme variation at a number of levels                of biological organization, including biochemical, metabolic,                   physiological and populational, to understand adaptive mechanisms               thoroughly in a sea anemone, Metridium senile.  Previous work                   has shown that there are differences in properties of variants                  for the carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme glucosephosphate                       isomerase (Gpi) and that these differences result in alteration                 of carbohydrate metabolism.  During the course of the present                   project the investigators will determine whether enzyme                         differences affect other levels of metabolism.  Specifically,                   this phase of the project will investigate the modulation of                    lipid metabolism and additional portions of carbohydrate by                     metabolism Gpi variants.  The working hypothesis is that                        differences in properties of Gpi variants contribute to                         adaptation to environmental temperature.  Experiments will be                   conducted using radiolabeled compounds to determine whether                     modulation of carbohydrate metabolism in turn affects lipid                     synthesis.  These experiments will provide essential information                to test the hypothesis that natural selection by thermal                        environments is the cause for observed geographic variation in                  proportions of Gpi variants long the northeast coast of the US.                      The project will contribute to basic understanding of                      mechanisms by which organisms become genetically and                            metabolically adapted to environmental differences.  Because                    enzyme-genetic variation is found in all living things, our                     results will shed light on a question of fundamental importance                 in understanding the process of adaptation.  More specifically,                 the project will yield understanding of genetic aspects of                      temperature adaptation, of potential practical importance in                    determining likely consequences of human alterations of the                     thermal environment.  The result may also shed fundamental light                on the importance of small differences in enzyme properties for                 metabolic regulation.",
