Existing knowledge about the effective                                          communication of public disaster warnings                                       largely rests on a data base of pre-impact                                      warnings.  A gap exists regarding knowledge                                     about the determinants and process whereby the                                  public hears, perceives and responds to                                         warnings during the post-impact disaster                                        emergency period.  This research is a study of                                  public perception and response to aftershock                                    warnings following the Loma Prieta Earthquake.                                  Mail questionnaires will collect relevant data                                  on 800 households representing San Francisco                                    (a media rich environment) and Santa Cruz (a                                    media sparse environment) households.  The                                      process and determinants of that process                                        whereby the public hears, perceives and                                         responds to warnings during the immediate                                       aftermath of a disaster will be determined.                                     Quick-response field research after this quake                                  suggest that there is much to be learned.                                       This quake provides an opportunity to conduct                                   a systematic study on this topic for perhaps                                    the first time.",
