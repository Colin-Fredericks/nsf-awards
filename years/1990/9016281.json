 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1988 fires that burned Yellowstone National Park present               a unique opportunity to investigate ecological responses to                     large-scale disturbance. A striking feature of the fires was the                resulting heterogeneity of the burned landscape, in terms of                    both the overall burning patterns and the variable fire severity                within the burned areas.  Few ecological studies have dealt                     explicitly with the spatial variation of disturbance effects in a               systematic and quantitative way.  And previous research suggests                that species' responses to disturbance may vary not only in                     relation to moisture, temperature, and other environmental                      gradients, but also with the size, shape, and heterogeneity of                  disturbed sites. The 1988 fires present a unique opportunity for                ecologists to study plant reestablishment following large-scale                 fires.                                                                               Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner will evaluate the relative                  importance of size and spatial patterning of fire-created patches               in the Yellowstone landscape for reestablishment of plant species               representing different modes of reproduction.  The investigators                hypothesize that the rates of plant reestablishment are                         controlled in part by the geometry of the landscape, but that the               relative importance of landscape structure differs with the                     plant's mode of reproduction.                                                        These investigators are highly qualified experts in the area               of landscape ecology. The institutional support for this research               is outstanding.",
