 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of sediment transport on the antarctic                  continental margin in the vicinity of floating glacier tongues and              restrictive fjord environments.  It is concerned with determining               the importance of mid-water and deep cold  water tongues in the                 transport processes, and whether precise links can be established               between the observed glacial-climatic regime and the resulting                  depositional record.                                                                                                                                            The depositional record will be reconstructed from a coring program             and from high resolution seismic reflection profiles.  The expected             (from earlier studies) thick holocene sections with pronounced                  internal changes in texture and composition, will be analyzed for               their implications with respect to the responses of antarctic fjord             glacier systems to holocene climate changes.  The field work will               be carried out in the Antarctic Peninsula.                                                                                                                      This research activity is submitted under the Research at                       Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  It will prepare students             for professional careers and for graduate study through their                   direct involvement in the field program and in the laboratory                   analyses of the core samples.  The activities will also provide a               source of topics for senior theses and for laboratory projects.",
