 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stomata are biological valves in the aerial organs of plants that               regulate simultaneously photosynthesis and transpiration.  The                  opening and closing of stomata are affected by the shrinking or                 swelling of \"guard cells\" which form their edges.  The                          chloroplasts of the guard cells that surround the stomatal pore                 do not senesce (yellow) at the same time as those in mesophyll                  tissue of the same leaf.  The long range goal of the project is                 to culture stomatal guard cells in ways that preserve their                     unique physiological properties, including the functionality of                 their chloroplasts.  Such cultures could be used to study the                   induction and regulation of chloroplast senescence.  This                       laboratory has established protoplasts of stomatal guard cells of               Nicotiana glauca in culture.  However, optimal conditions for                   cell survival have not yet been identified.  A variety of culture               conditions will be evaluated to identify those that are optimal                 for cell survival.  To determine whether any of the unique                      properties of guard cells are maintained in culture, some of the                physiological and biochemical properties of freshly isolated                    guard cell protoplasts will be compared to those of protoplasts                 of cultured cells.  The same experiments will be performed with                 guard cell protoplasts from senescing (chlorotic) leaves:  1) to                evaluate their viability relative to those of                                   guard cells of non-senescing leaves, and 2) to determine whether                there are any differences in the properties of guard cells of the               two types of leaves that might explain why the stomata of                       senescing leaves fail to open in response to light.                                                                                                             This research is directed at developing techniques for culturing                stomatal guard cells from leaves under conditions that not only                 permit their survival but also maintain their differentiated                    properties.   The availability of such cultured cells would                     greatly facilitate further research on the physiological function               of these cells which regulate the passage of water and gases                    across the surfaces of leaves.  Since the chlorophyll-containing                organelles, chloroplasts, of guard cells behave differently from                the chloroplasts of other cells under some physiological                        conditions, these cells would provide an excellent model system                 in which to study the regulation of the functional state of                     chloroplasts.  Since this research will be conducted at an                      undergraduate institution it will also provide an excellent                     opportunity for undergraduate students to gain first hand                       experience in research in plant cell biology.",
