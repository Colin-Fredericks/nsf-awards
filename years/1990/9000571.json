 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image formation in and through irregular media, ranging from                    atmospheric inhomogeneities to the very difficult case of diffusely             scattering media such as human tissue, remains a major challenge of             image science.  The range of technology that has been brought to bear           on these problems is considerable, including active adaptive optics,            image deconvolution, phase retrieval and phase conjugation.  The                present work proposes various ideas for imaging through                         inhomogeneities and for imaging objects embedded within                         inhomogeneities.  The first category, imaging through inhomogeneities,          embodies extensions of a technique recently developed by the principal          investigator for imaging through inhomogeneities using a                        superresolution technique.  The goal is to extend this capability in            various ways, in particular, to eliminate the need for an aberration-           free path from source to the mixer, which can be accomplished by                combining spatial and temporal encoding techniques.  The second                 category is the imaging of objects embedded within the inhomogeneity.           Several techniques are proposed, such as confocal scanning with the             use of extremely short pulses of light.",
