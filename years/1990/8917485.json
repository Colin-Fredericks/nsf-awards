 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic premise for this research is two-fold:  first, to                exploit the full capabilities of laser-initiated polymerization                 as a critical and novel method for probing the kinetics and                     mechanisms of photopolymerization processes under a variety of                  conditions for a number of different types of monomer systems;                  and, second, to establish a rationale for defining the operating                parameter for laser-initiated polymerization applications for                   such applications as imaging, curing of coatings for optical                    fibers, microcircuit processing, etc.  The importance of the                    rapidly developing laser-initiated polymerization field and its                 potential for use in American industry cannot be minimized.  We                 will continue to investigate the basics of polymerization                       kinetics of simple monofunctional monomers in bulk and solution,                while placing special emphasis on laser-initiated of                            multifunctional/crosslinking monomers and polymerization of                     liquid-crystalline systems.  In addition, we propose to                         investigate the laser-initiated of other polymerization types                   including templated systems, cationic-initiated polymerizations,                and microemulsions in an effort to provide a fundamental kinetic                analysis for these systems.",
