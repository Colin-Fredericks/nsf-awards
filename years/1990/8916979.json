 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators have discovered a new locus in Drosophila named               Blackpatch, Bpt, whose mutation disrupts development of the adult               brain and eye.  Individuals expressing a Bpt mutation have a                    variety of defects in adult brain and eye development, including:               degenerating black spots in the eye, partial or complete absence                of the adult brain, and adult paralysis and premature death.                    However, Bpt mutations only produce these effects in individuals                expressing a facet mutant phenotype (facet is an adult phenotype                of certain mutant alleles at the Notch locus).  In non-facet                    individuals, Bpt mutations produce no detectable phenotypic                     effects.                                                                                                                                                        These preliminary results suggest Bpt functions in the                          development of the adult nervous system and that it interacts                   with, or acts on, Notch.  The role of Notch in embryonic nervous                development has been well documented, making it important that                  its role in adult development also be defined.  A key part of                   such a definition will be identifying the role of genes like Bpt                that interact with Notch during specific stages of development.                                                                                                 The goals of the experiments are:  to define the                                phenotype effects of Bpt mutations, to analyze the genetics and                 developmental genetics of the Bpt, to investigate the interaction               of Bpt mutations with other mutations that affect eye and/or                    nerve development, and to generate genetic material for the                     isolation and cloning of the Bpt locus.",
