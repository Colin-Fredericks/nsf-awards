 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site           is continued.  The NSF support for 10 undergraduate students each year          will allow them to become involved in the research activities of the            faculty.  This experience is designed to provide students with an               improved understanding of research and to encourage them to consider            careers in research.  Support for this REU will provide continuity for          our program carried out in the summers of 1988 and 1989, supplement             the commitment to such research activities, and provide students with           the opportunity to participate in ongoing cutting-edge research                 projects.  The research activities span the areas of expertise of the           faculty in civil engineering and include projects in water resources,           bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics.                 Components of the program include identification of exceptional                 students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and              minority participation; matching of student research interests with             faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty; close              interaction of graduate students and faculty with the undergraduates            to provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate study,               university research, and careers in academia; an intense two month              research experience; mini-courses, as needed, to facilitate                     effectiveness in the research projects; and a mini-conference for               presentation of results.  The goal of the program is to excite some of          the best engineering students in the nation about the challenges of a           career in research.",
