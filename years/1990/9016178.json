The dynamics of ecological processes as                well as impacts from disturbance often are measured by changes in               vegetation.  Traditional methods of vegetation analysis are labor               intensive, slow, and as a result, they often are confined to                    small-scale measurement.  Many current research topics (i.e.                    climate change) require  analysis over large areas, and although                remote sensing from space is providing unprecedented information,               validation of satellite imagery with large-scale vegetation                     analysis is lacking.                                                                                                                                            A new, ground-based methodology has been developed by an                        interdisciplinary group at the University of New Mexico that is                 significantly increasing the ability of scientists to study                     environmental dynamics across a range of scales and allow                       integration with reflectance measurements from satellite                        instruments.  The resulting system will provide a method of                     easily performing detailed analysis of near ground level images                 on a computer workstation.//",
