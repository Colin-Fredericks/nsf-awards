 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temporal logic is a useful, powerful formalism for the specification,           analysis, and development of a large class of systems, referred to as           reactive systems.  This class of systems includes concurrent and real-          time programs, process control and embedded programs, hardware                  devices, and other systems whose role is to maintain a continuous               interaction with their environment.  This project is to conduct a               research aimed at making the temporal formalism into a practical tool.          The primary goals are to establish a uniform temporal-logic                     methodology for the specification, verification, development, and               automatic synthesis of reactive systems, and to construct an                    experimental system that will provide computerized support for these            activities.  Specific topics to be investigated include:  the                   expressive power and convenience of specification by temporal logic,            and its possible improvements by extensions such as past operators and          quantification over state-variables; combination of temporal logic              with transition systems, such as automata; and compositionality of              temporal specifications as a basis for systematic development by                decomposition and refinement.",
