Students engage in a 4-week experience in science and engineering on the        campus of Texas A&M, with special orientation toward Chemical                   Engineering.  Approximately equal numbers of males/females and                  minorities/non-minorities are included.  The program includes research          projects under the direction of engineering faculty as well as classroom        instruction and discussions in communications skills, research                  techniques, engineering problem solving, creativity, ethics, using              spreadsheets on PC's to solve problems and career orientation.  Campus          field trips through scientific facilities and plant trips through               industrial facilities are included.  Written and oral reports will be           required on the research projects and plant trips.  Students from small         and rural high schools are targeted.  Follow-up includes presentations          to high school or peer groups.",
