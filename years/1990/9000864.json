 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The College of Biological Sciences at              the University of Minnesota to establish a summer program of                    undergraduate research experiences targeted to women and members                of under-represented minority groups.  The NSF/REU program will                 involve 10 high ability undergraduate students, at least half of                whom will be from under-represented minority groups.  Students will             work under the direction of university faculty members who have a               common interest in research involving recombinant DNA technology.               The primary objective of the 10-week summer program is to provide               a challenging and enriching educational experience for outstanding              undergraduate students and thereby strengthen their interest in                 pursuing graduate education and research in the biological                      sciences.                                                                                                                                                       The program will be modeled after a 1989 pilot program of Summer                Research for Women and Minorities, which included four Black, four              Hispanic, and three Native American undergraduates.  The average                GPA of the 16 students in the 1989 program was 3.5.  Aggressive                 recruitment strategies have been designed to recruit an equally                 talented and diverse group of participants for 1990.  Approximately             1,000 letters will be sent to recruit high ability women and                    minority students from the Twin Cities metropolitan area, at                    institutions with high minority enrollments, and at major                       universities in the states with a large minority population.",
