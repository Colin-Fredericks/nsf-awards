The               conference, sponsored by the Center for Growth Studies of the                   Houston Area Research Center on the U.S. side and by the Centro de              Investigacion Para el Desarrollo (IBAFIN) on the Mexican side,                  will examine the extent of bi-national integration between the two              countries in a number of important industries, assess industry                  plans for further integration, and develop policy recommendations               on how industrial integration between the two nations would be                  more effectively pursued.                                                                                                                                       The conference will have three major outcomes: (1) preparation and              presentation of detailed analyses of integration in six significant             industries; (2) policy recommendations on industrial integration                between the two countries; and (3) the publication of a volume of               conference papers in English and Spanish.  Thus, the project will               inform the general public in both nations, and internationally,                 about how intimately integrated the industrial structures of the                United States and Mexico are becoming, and the opportunities for                economic growth that could be achieved through additional                       integration.",
