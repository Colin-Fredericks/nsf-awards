 "awd_abstract_narration": "New experiments will be added to our upper division, modern                     physics laboratory courses.  The junior course serves as an                     introduction to quantum physics while the senior course is the                  culmination of the undergraduate training.  In junior                           laboratory, we will add an experiment measuring the vibration                   levels of polar molecules as a function of temperature and a                    Compton scattering experiment.  In senior lab, we will add                      experiments in surface science, including LEED, Auger                           spectroscopy, and a tunneling microscope capable of imaging                     individual atoms on surfaces.  These instruments can be used to                 study surface disorder, structures of surfaces, electron                        screening, and the effects of adsorbates on surfaces.  Magnetic                 flux measurements will be made using superconducting Josephson                  junctions at low temperatures.  In addition to studying                         properties of superconductors, students will measure a precise                  value of e/m using a superconducting loop with a series junction.               Finally, students will perform a nonlinear dynamics experiment                  demonstrating the new and beautiful ideas of chaos discovered in                classical systems.  These new experiments will provide the                      training for professional physicists expected by research                       laboratories in both industry and graduate school.",
