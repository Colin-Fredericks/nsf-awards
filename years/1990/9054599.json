 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"Math, Science and Technology Education for Riverbend               in the 90's\" aims to enhance math and science education for                     non-baccalaureate bound students in community college preparatory               programs and career programs in grades 6-12.  The project will                  involve directly 35 teachers and 740 students.  It will help to                 prepare students for technological careers.  Current applications               of science and mathematics will be integrated into the curricula.               Underrepresented populations will be served.                                                                                                                    Independent mail reviews of the proposal were followed by a panel               discussion.  Each reviewer then provided detailed written                       comments identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal               and giving his or her individual rating.                                                                                                                        The panelists viewed this as a comprehensive program with several               strengths.  There is a clear need for programs that will educate                the non-baccalaureate and that will reach underrepresented                      populations.  The project is well planned and well thought out.                 It is cost effective.                                                                                                                                           The panel worried that 25% involvement of the project director                  may be too low.  elementary teachers should be involved.  The                   expectations of computer literacy may be too high.  The hourly                  rate of $415 needs clarification.                                                                                                                               Two of the panelists rated the proposal excellent and four rated                it very good.  I concur with this meritorious assessment.  If                   negotiations can remove the weaknesses, I recommend funding.",
