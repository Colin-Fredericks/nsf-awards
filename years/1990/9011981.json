 "awd_abstract_narration": "Performance is a major issue in the design and implementation of                systems such as computer systems, production systems, communication             networks, and flexible manufacturing systems.  The success or failure           of such systems is judged by the degree to which performance measures           are of great interest.  In the last two decades it has been                     demonstrated several times that performance can be evaluated or                 predicted well by queueing network models.  For queueing networks               with nodes of infinite capacity numerous methods have been introduced           in the last two decades.  However, since in actual systems nodes have           a finite capacity, queueing networks with blocking should be used for           accurate modeling for performance analysis.  Queueing networks with             blocking have thus become an interesting research topic in recent               years.  Several researchers have suggested  different solution                  techniques.  Previous studies, however, are restricted to exponential           service time distributions, single job classes and FCFS scheduling              disciplines.  In actual systems the devices may have different                  scheduling disciplines, the job behavior may vary and the service               times are drawn non-exponentially.  Therefore, this project                     investigates queueing networks having finite capacity, four different           node types and multiple job classes.  Several                                   approximate ways as well as exact solutions to solving these models             are studied.",
