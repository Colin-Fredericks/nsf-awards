 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue his               studies into the numerical analysis of phase transitions and free               boundary problems that arise in fluid dynamics and elasticity.                  In particular, he will analyze, design and implement adaptive                   finite element methods for the solution of the Phase Field Model                and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.  Special emphasis will be placed                upon stability and error analyses in nonenergy norms, such as the               maximum norm, and upon the efficiency and reliability of the                    resulting algorithms.                                                                Many phenomena in nature involve what are called free                      boundary problems, wherein a large part of the solution process                 is devoted to determining the location of a moving boundary                     between two or more different media.  A good example is a weather               forecast or the weather map in your newspaper.  Here                            meteorologists try to predict the speed and location of fronts;                 in this context fronts are the words used for moving boundaries                 between warm and cold air, for example.  With this the principal                investigator  will design numerical methods for finding the                     solution of some free boundary problems that come from the theory               of elasticity.                                                                  **",
