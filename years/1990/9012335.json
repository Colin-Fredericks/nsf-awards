 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a distinguished cultural anthropologist,                who has published widely on the ethno-ecology of the Philippines,               in a study of the local knowledge of Asian rice (Oryza Sativa).                 The investigator will record how multiple and interlocking                      categorizations and evaluations of rice are structured and how                  such cognitive and associated behavior patterns are employed in                 an integrated fashion under varying environmental conditions.                   Aided by prior linguistic and ethnoecological research, this                    project will examine in detail the everyday as well as the                      extraordinary handling of rice both as biotic resource and as                   cultural artifact.  The investigator will consult with colleagues               at the International Rice institute on the long-term stability                  and change in rice germ plasms.                                                                                                                                 This research is important because rice is one of the world's                   great food crops, and yet a detailed scientific study of the full               range of knowledge and practice associated in a culture with this               crop has not been done.  This case will be a benchmark for                      comparative studies of the knowledge and uses of rice and will                  help planners develop programs to maximize and sustain valuable                 diversity.",
