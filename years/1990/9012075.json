 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the age of 18 months on, toddlers learn new words at the                   phenomenal rate of over 9 a day|  To support such successful                    learning, children must have considerable knowledge of the nature               of the meanings words encode.  This research will seek a precise                characterization of that knowledge and of its roots in early                    infancy.  The research will focus on one aspect of word meaning,                that of quantification.  Language makes use of many different                   types of quantificational devices, including quantifiers (\"a,                   another, some, more....\"), the numerals, and count/mass syntax.                 Knowledge of quantification would help even the learning of                     nouns, for nouns carry quantificational commitments in their                    meanings.  Children use quantifiers, apparently correctly, very                 early in language production.  Recent research has shown,                       however, that children do not know what the count words mean for                over a year after they have been counting.  This raises the                     possibility that they do not know what the other quantifiers mean               either.                                                                                                                                                         The studies will use new techniques to assess what even babies                  know about number.  Further, the techniques will allow the                      assessment of patterns of generalization to new contexts of                     various types of newly-taught words, supported by different sorts               of quantifiers.  A longitudinal study will assess the process by                which two-year-olds work out the meanings of number words.  The                 outcome of these studies will be an understanding of the                        conceptual underpinnings normal young children bring to language                learning, and the conceptual change they must undergo to grasp                  the meaning of number words like \"two.\"                                                                                                                         Research on normal cognitive development and normal language                    development is important  scientifically, for it bears on what                  makes humans unique among animals.  But it is also essential for                understanding the many ways language acquisition goes awry in                   various abnormal populations.  Such understanding must precede                  interventions to help children overcome specific cognitive                      deficits.",
