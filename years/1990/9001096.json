 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Beer has been involved in the study of topologies                on the closed convex subsets of a normed linear space.  Such                    topologies give rise to topologies on convex functions, with a                  function identified with its epigraph, the set of points on or                  above its graph.  In the last two years, Professor Beer                         introduced a topology compatible with Mosco convergence of                      sequences of convex sets, showing that it is stable with respect                to duality if and only if the underlying space is reflexive.                    Several characterizations of the topology were obtained, and                    continuity properties of a variety of operators and functionals                 on convex sets were studied.  In response to the unsuitability of               this Mosco topology in the nonreflexive case, and in view of some               prior promising results regarding the norm convergence of linear                functionals and their level sets, Professor Beer studied the                    topology of uniform convergence of distance functionals on                      bounded sets.  Not only is this topology stable with respect to                 duality without restriction, but it is also the right convergence               notion in terms of the stability of solutions of convex                         optimization problems.                                                               Professor Beer will continue his studies on convergence of                 convex sets, with particular attention to connections with Banach               space geometry, approximation of multifunctions, and specific                   operations and functionals.  He also hopes to become involved in                applications of set convergence in evolving research in the                     foundations of nonsmooth analysis, e.g., to certain optimization                problems.",
