 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a model to study how plants react to pathogenic attack the                   response of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to tobacco mosaic virus                 (TMV) is being investigated.  In response to a variety of                       pathogenic and chemcial agents tobacco plants produce large                     amounts of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins whose synthesis has               been associated with resistance to TMV.  This laboratory has                    focused on the synthesis, location, and function of the PR1                     family of these proteins.  Salicylic acid (SA) has been used                    extensively as an inducer of PR proteins and local acquired                     resistance to TMV.  These observations together with the recent                 finding that endogenous SA levels rose at least 20-fold in leaves               of TMV-resistant, but not susceptible, tobacco after TMV                        inoculation suggest that SA may be part of the natural induction                pathway following TMV infection.  A major objective is to                       determine the role of SA in induction of PR1 genes.  This may                   provide an important avenue to define intermediate steps in the                 signal transduction pathway that leads to the defense response                  following pathogenic assault.  As part of this analysis the cis                 acting element(s) and trans acting factor(s) necessary for SA                   induction will be defined.                                                                                                                                      Many plants respond to viral infection by the production of                     certain proteins which have been termed \"pathogenesis-related                   proteins\".  The goal of this research is to understand the                      molecular signals by which the genes for pathogenesis-related                   protein are activated.  The results of this research will                       contribute to basic knowledge of the mechanisms of plant defense                against viruses.",
