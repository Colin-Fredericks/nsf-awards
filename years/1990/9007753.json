 "awd_abstract_narration": "Practical distributed database systems operate without rigid                    centralized control.  Such systems are considered to be federated               distributed systems, and attractive for involving many sites,                   dispersed authority, and differences in requirements of level of                data abstraction and of all data being-up-to-date.  The                         interaction via communication networks, the partial limited                     availability of network nodes, delays in local data acquisition,                and the actual delay and cost of computations to derive data for                remote sites all conspire to defeat simple approaches to network-               wide data consistency. The problems of lack of synchrony among                  the nodes have been recognized piecemeal and many methods and                   heuristics to manage data in this environment have been proposed.               We have a simple model to permit designers and users to specify                 the extent to which consistency can be temporarily relaxed.  The                FAUVE research  classifies existing algorithms and heuristics,                  identifies conflicts in assumptions made, and recognizes                        complementary approaches.  It provides a framework to focus on                  situations now not adequately dealt with. This framework provides               the users with specifications, and provides database operations                 on federated databases with a measure of success or failure.                    Such a measure is essential for the scientific progress in this                 subtopic of modern computer systems research.",
