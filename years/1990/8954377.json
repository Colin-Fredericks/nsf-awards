 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty-five college teachers of mathematics are being brought together          for three weeks to share a common interest in exploring discrete                mathematics as it is applied to a variety of topics.  The conference            covers selected fundamental topics from contemporary discrete                   mathematics and its applications with the goal of modernizing                   undergraduate courses related to this area.  To this end, emphasis is           placed on basic new theoretical results and their uses, as well as              fundamental  geometrical concepts, modeling methodologies  and problem          solving techniques.  The application to other areas other than                  mathematics are also discussed.  The mornings are devoted to lectures           by the main speakers and the afternoons to the group discussions,               problem solving, participant talks, classroom                                   applications/improvements, and the use of computer facilities.  The             participants  are requested to submit a report indicating how these             ideas were incorporated into, or affected their courses and/or research         during the 1990-91 school year.  These reports are then distributed to          all of the participants.                                                                                                                                        The home institutions of the participants are sharing in the support of         the program, by providing transportation costs for the participants to          attend the meeting.",
