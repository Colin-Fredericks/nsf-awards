 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Genetic Mechanisms of Evolution.  The faculty                 group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators               who come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a                common interest in the study of genetic mechanisms and their role               in the biology and evolution of organisms.  The funds will provide              stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will                   defray part of the cost of the trainees' research, will enable                  undergraduate students to participate research during the summer,               and will allow the trainees to attend scientific meetings.  In                  addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research                   equipment to be used by trainees, to defray part of the cost of                 trainees' research and to bring investigators from other                        institutions to Eugene for colloquia.                                                                                                                           In recent years, genetics has benefitted from the development of                powerful new techniques for genomic analysis.  These techniques                 permit studies of genetic variability in laboratory and wild animal             populations that were previously impossible.  Similarly, they allow             relatively facile analysis of physical traits (phenotypes) that                 result from the combined action of several genes.  This development             has provided an unparalleled opportunity for the study of the                   interplay of genetic variation, phenotypic variation and the                    environment that occurs during evolution.  To take the fullest                  advantage of this opportunity, investigators will need a                        fundamental understanding of the principles and practices of                    molecular biology, of population biology and of evolutionary                    biology.  This award provides funding for a training program that               will produce just such individuals.",
