 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several fish species, besides the famous electric eel, are now                  known to have electric organs, and use weak electric organ                      discharges (EOD) for three main functions.  Electrolocation is                  used both \"actively\" and \"passively\" much as a dolphin can use                  hearing for both echolocation and for passive listening, and                    variations in EOD are used for communication between                            individuals.  The continual discharge produces an electric field                of a particular shape around the fish, and the \"mormyromast\"                    class of receptors for \"active\" electrolocation detect                          deformations in this field.  These signals are sent by afferent                 nerves to the mormyromast region of the electrosensory                          lateral-line lobe (ELL), in the midbrain.  This project                         concentrates on characterizing the physiology and morphology of                 the different cell classes in this important area, where very                   little is now known.  The ease of using external artificial                     electric stimuli means that many generalizable aspects of neural                timing relations can be studied in this brain circuitry.  Precise               morphology in this region will be needed to understand how the                  anatomical local circuits contribute to the processing.  The ELL                has some similarity to the cerebellum, and may well reveal                      equally interesting mechanisms of timing and plasticity control.                Results will be fundamental for understanding electrosensory                    mechanisms, and also will have important implications for general               understanding of sensorimotor integration and neuronal                          processing.",
