 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is widely believed that variation in recruitment                  (the introduction of new individuals to a population) can                       influence the structure and dynamics of marine populations, the                 specific causes and consequences of variable recruitment are                    poorly known for any species with planktonic larvae.  The present               evidence suggests that recruitment of the acorn barnacle,                       Semibalanus balanoides, is strongly influenced by oceanographic                 features that dictate larval supply.  Moreover, the resulting                   recruitment variation hypothetically can strongly influence the                 distribution, abundance, demography, and genetic structure of                   barnacle populations in previously unsuspected ways.  On the                    basis of these preliminary data three young scientists Drs.                     Gaines, Bertness and Geyer will initiate a regional study to                    examine the links between a specific coastal oceanographic                      feature (embayment flushing time), water column larval abundance,               benthic recruitment variation, and population processes in                      Semibalanus balanoides.  Specifically, this investigation will:                                                                                                 1)  examine the hypothesis that variation in flushing rates among               sheltered bays and among years generates variation in larval                    abundance and shoreline settlement rates,                                                                                                                       2)  evaluate experimentally the relative importance of this                     regional and temporal variation in recruitment to the                           distribution, abundance, and demography of barnacle                             populations, and,                                                                                                                                               3)  test the hypothesis that variation in larval retention                      among sheltered bays predictably affects the degree of local                    adaptation of barnacle populations by altering rates of gene                    flow.                                                                                                                                                           This work will address critically important issues in our                       understanding of the ecology and evolution of species with                      complex life histories.",
