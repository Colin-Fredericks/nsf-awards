 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will probe strongly interacting atomic                       systems to develop practical computational schemes for                          treating them. There are five projects to be undertaken:                             (1.)  Perturbation Series of Strongly Interacting Atoms                    and Ions.  The new perturbation series developed for strongly                   interacting systems will be formally extended to treat                          ionization and applied to compute cross sections for the                        interaction of highly ionized atoms with low Z targets.  Some                   connections of this work and QED have recently been discovered                  and it is expected they will be explored further.                                    2. New Time Dependent Variational Principle.  A new time                   dependent variational principle akin to the Schwinger principle                 for time independent problems will be applied to some of the                    problems of part 1.  The advantage of the variational                           formulation is to be able to derive higher order approxi-                       mations to the distorting potential used in the strong                          potential Born calculations for highly ionized systems.                               3. Hyperspherical Expansions.  The hyperspherical                         expansion developed earlier will be applied to the scattering                   of H+ on deuterium as a test of the \"translation factor free\"                   theory.  Particular attention will be paid to electron transfer                 reactions.  All that remains is the actual coupled channel                      calculation using the computed wave functions and potential                     curves.                                                                               4. Saddle Point Effects In Secondary Electron Spectra.                    Work on saddle point effects in secondary electron spectra will                 be continued.  New approximations to the electron propagator                    will be developed which contain rotational effects and the new                  propagator will be used to compute an approximate wave function                 for the final state.  The primary difficulty is the numerical                   evaluation of the multiple integrals but this seems quite                       tractable.  There are close connections with experimental work                  at Nebraska and Tennessee.                                                           5. Alignment and Orientation in the Abramov Model.                         Alignment and orientation parameters are a very sensitive test                  of collisional approximations.  The Abromov model has been                      developed to compute these parameters for states formed by                      electron capture at low velocities.  The model will be applied                  and tested against existing experiment.  The hope is to                         stimulate further measurements.  There is close co-operation                    with the experimental groups at Oak Ridge, Kansas State, and                    other highly charged ion sources such as that at Cornell.",
