 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Studies of Urban Poverty, Race and Social Policy              through a collaborative effort of faculty members at the University             of Chicago and Northwestern University.   The faculty group is a                mixture of outstanding junior and senior investigators who come                 from a variety of disciplines.  These include sociology, economics              and public policy.  The funds provided to the University of Chicago             by this award will provide stipends for graduate students and                   postdoctoral fellows, and will defray part of the cost of the                   trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase                specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring             investigators from other research and academic institutions for                 symposia and colloquia.                                                                                                                                         Understanding the structure of modern American society and the                  problems it poses for the development and implementation of public              policy is one of the most significant challenges for social                     scientists.  Sophisticated research in this area now requires that              paradigms and techniques from economics, political science and                  demography be coupled.  This RTG program will produce a new                     generation of investigators and teachers with the necessary                     combination of intellectual and research skills.",
