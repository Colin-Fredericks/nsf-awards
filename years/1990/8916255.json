 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meiobenthic animals are thought to interfere with larval                     recruitment of large marine animals known as macrobenthos, both                 as they settle and subsequently as the young juveniles mature                   and occupy sediments.  The nature of this \"meiofaunal                           bottleneck\" is  poorly understood except for some experimental                  evidence from sandy sediments that some turbellarians eat                       settled larvae.                                                                      Experiments will be undertaken to test the effect of                       functionally different meiobenthos on the success of                            macrofaunal  larval settlement, juvenile movement, and juvenile                 growth and survival.  In both laboratory and field experiments                  functionally  different kinds of larval macrofauna will be                      allowed to settle with functionally different meiobenthos to                    determine if one more  meiobenthic type inhibits or enhances                    larval settlement.  In the  laboratory, metamorphosed                           macrofauna will be allowed to migrate from meiofaunal patches                   to test the effect of meiofauna on juvenile emigration and                      dispersion.  Additionally selected macrobenthic juveniles will                  be forced to live with different meiofauna to determine the                     effect on juvenile survivorship and growth.  The experiments                    are designed to predict early macrofaunal recruitment, growth,                  and survivorship in the presence of functionally different                      meiobenthos.",
