Researchers from the                                                                                                United States and Western Europe will focus their attention on the                                                                                              cultural, political, economic and technical factors that shape                  choices to develop some scientific and technological possibilities                                                                                              but to ignore or suppress others.  Presenters will provide case                 studies of particular scientific and technological developments,                                                                                                and encourage comparisons and contrasts of these changes in                     different national settings and technological sectors                           (manufacturing, information, military, domestic, reproductive,                  scientific).  These comparisons should allow for informed                       reassessments to several models of scientific and technological                 choice:  from \"technological determinism,\" where the logic of                   technical efficiency and rationality are thought to guide choices                                                                                               that, once made and implemented, have diverse consequences for                  society, to the more voluntaristic \"social constructivism,\" where                                                                                               ethical, political, organizational and economic factors are thought                                                                                             to be embedded in these choices.  These theoretical issues are at                                                                                               the core of social studies of science and technology today, and                 this conference brings key contributors together in an American                 setting for the first time.

This project allows a highly qualified group of researchers from                                                                                                different disciplinary backgrounds in the United States and Europe                                                                                              to address theoretical issues in science and technology studies by                                                                                              considering cross-cultural cases of scientific and technological                                                                                                developments.  The principal investigators and conference                       participants are well qualified; institutional support is very                  good.  A volume of general interest to the field will result.  The                                                                                              budget request is modest.  Support is recommended.",
