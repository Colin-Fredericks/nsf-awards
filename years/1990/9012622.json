 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intertidal algae in sub-polar and temperate regions experience                  frequent and severe freezing during tidal emersion in the winter.               The ability to survive repeated freezing is an important                        adaptation, and may greatly influence vertical zonation.  In                    contrast to higher plants, relatively little is known about the                 ecological or physiological effects of freezing on marine                       macroalgae.  This research will focus on the role of freezing as                a sub-lethal stress, which reduces growth and perhaps competitive               ability, by examining the effect of freezing on photosynthesis.                 The research will address the following questions: (1) what                     mechanisms are responsible for freezing resistance, (2) does the                same mechanism confer resistance to both freezing and                           desiccation, (3) are interspecific differences in freezing                      resistance correlated with tidal height due to genetic adaptation               or phenotypic acclimation, and (4) does the relative importance                 of freezing acclimation vary between upper-shore, stress                        tolerant, and lower-shore, competitive algae?  This investigation               will contribute to our knowledge of freezing as an ecological                   factor, and also address questions of general importance to all                 scientists studying the intertidal zone.",
