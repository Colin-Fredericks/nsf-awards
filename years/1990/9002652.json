 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparison of the amino acid sequences of plant vacuolar proteins               indicates that there is no sequence in common among these                       proteins which can be solely responsible for targeting to                       vacuoles.  Therefore, the study of sorting signals from different               proteins will be required to understand the structural                          determinants involved in this process.  Gramineae lectins, which                are vacuolar proteins, are among the best characterized plant                   proteins.  Amino acid sequences, 3-D protein structures, and                    cDNAs for these lectins are available.  Transgenic tobacco plants               and suspension cultures have been obtained which correctly                      express and process barley lectin.  The goals of this research                  for the next five years include the analysis and characterization               of protein sequences responsible for sorting to the vacuole and                 the identification of a putative receptor (or receptors) which                  recognizes these sorting sequences and subsequently mediates                    protein transport to vacuoles.  The vacuolar sorting signal of                  the barley lectin proprotein will be identified and analyzed.                   Once the sorting signal is identified, the following questions                  will be addressed:  1) What is the shortest sequence capable of                 redirecting a reporter protein to the vacuole?  2) What are the                 specific amino acids within the sorting domain that are                         responsible for correct targeting?  3) Is secondary structure of                the sorting signal important?  The characteristics of binding of                probarley lectin to its putative receptor(s) will also be                       determined.                                                                                                                                                     Maintenance of separate subcellular compartments in eukaryotic                  cells depends on the correct sorting and targeting of newly                     synthesized proteins.  Thus, mechanisms must exist in the cell to               assure that these proteins are targeted to the correct                          intracellular membranes.  In plants, many proteins are deposited                in multifunctional organelles called vacuoles.  These proteins                  contribute to the lysosomal, storage, and plant defense functions               of the vacuole.  The goal of this research is to understand the                 mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the plant cell                     vacuole.  The results will contribute important new information                 on this important problem in plant cell biology.",
