 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the evolution of optimizing behavior in               a class of financial asset markets.  The sources of evolution are               \"economic natural selection\" in the marketplace and adaptation by               individual investors.  Selection dynamics are a consequence of                  wealth flows between investors, while adaptation arises from                    learning and search by individual investors.  Unlike much of the                literature on evolution in markets, this project studies                        individuals' behavior in financial asset markets rather than the                behavior of firms.  In addition to findings on the evolution of                 rationality (i.e., markets do not always select the traders who                 are most nearly optimizers or who have the most correct                         information), the preliminary investigations have discovered a                  great deal of regularity in the market process.  The                            investigators exploit this regularity to characterize the long                  run behavior of asset prices in financial markets and to explore                the effects of learning, entry and exit, search, and other                      sources of economic innovation.                                                                                                                                 This is a very important line of research.  The assumption that                 individuals behave as if they were rational (near optimizing) or                that firms maximize profits is based on the following natural                   selection argument.  Market forces punish non-optimizing traders                and poorly informed traders by redistributing to the more nearly                optimizing, better informed and better guessing traders.  In the                long run, these traders come to dominate the market.  Models of                 market rationality are widely used in financial economics.                      Preliminary work by these investigators suggests that the natural               selection process might not converge on a rational expectations                 equilibrium, that there are significant regularities in markets                 even when the market is not efficient in the long run, and these                regularities can provide a richer and more accurate conceptual                  framework for studying the dynamics of financial markets.",
