 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will integrate biophysical, biochemical,                  cellular, physiological and genetic studies on plasmodesmata (pd) to            establish an appropriate framework that will then allow an                      investigation of the cellular processes by which the plant regulates            its cell-to-cell communication system.  Biophysical studies will be             performed on a simple cellular system in order to determine the unitary         pd conductance.  Such measurements are essential for a further sub-             structural analysis of the pd, as well as to provide a rigorous                 foundation for detailed studies on the cellular controls that                   orchestrate cell-to-cell size exclusion limits.  Physiological studies          on the role of pd in solute fluxes will also be performed.  Since pd            are likely to be an important determinant of organ development, an              experimental system will be established that will permit identification         of the processes that control secondary pd formation.  In this ongoing          collaboration (between Lucas and Dr. Roger Beachy of Washington                 University, St. Louis), it has been established that transgenic tobacco         plants in which the 30 kDa movement protein (MP) of TMV is expressed            have pd whose size exclusion limits are up-regulated to sizes in excess         of 9.4 kDa.  The mode by which the 30 kDa TMV-MP effects this change            will be further explored.  It is hypothesized that this protein                 interacts directly with the plasmodesma.  Based on this concept,                biochemical isolation and purification of pd proteins are proposed.  A          genetic system in Arabidopsis will be developed to permit the                   identification and isolation of genes involved in virus movement and pd         function.                                                                                                                                                       Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels between individual plant cells.          Intercellular communication by passage of molecules through these               channels is critical for the normal development and physiological               function of the entire plant.  In certain plant viral infections, the           virus gains access to the cell interior at a localized site and passes          from cell to cell through the plasmodesmata throughout the plant.               Passage of the virus through plasmodesmata is facilitated by a virally          encoded protein which effectively enlarges the plasmodesmatal channel.          This research will take advantage of the viral protein to identify and          study the components of the plant plasmodesmata.  Knowledge of the              components of plasmodesmata will facilitate further studies of the              formation of plasmodesmata and the mechanisms by which molecular                traffic through the plasmodesmata is regulated.  The results of this            research will be important contributions to basic knowledge of cell to          cell communication in plants.",
