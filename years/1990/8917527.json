 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents the beginnings of the empirical                          examination of an alternative theoretical explanation of both                   the general phenomena of sustained wage differentials between                   qualitatively similar workers, and the particular phenomena of                  longstanding black-white employment and wage differentials.                     Two literatures provide the context for this proposal.  The                     first is represented by Krueger and Summer's review of studies                  on the inter-industry wage structures of capitalist economies.                  The second is a neoclassical theory that have rejected the idea                 that long-term labor market discrimination can persist in a                     competitive economy.  The proposed research agenda of this                      proposal speaks to both of these literatures.  To the extent                    that it can explain wage differentials between black and                        whites, it also addresses the more general concerns of wage                     theorists; however, it does so by making a radical departure                    from the orthodox economists' conventional conceptualization of                 competition.",
