 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal grant is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                     Program.  Dr. Zweifel is continuing his fruitful development of                 organometallic regents that contain unsaturation(carbon-carbon                  double or triple bonds).  These reagents have the potential to                  provide new routes to the unusual structures found in some                      pheromones in some pests and in some compounds used by sea                      organisms to communicate with each other.                                                                                                                       The specific aims of the research are:                                          (a) elaboration of the ethynyl and enol ether groups of                         1-methoxybut-1-en-3-yne into substituted five- and six-membered                 ring lactones, acylsilanes, 1,3-diynes, and                                     yne-1,2-propadienes.  The special merit of this lies in its                     potential for transforming an inexpensive starting material                     into diverse and synthetically attractive derivatives;                          (b) exploitation of the three potentially nucleophilic centers                  of 1-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-diyne derived mono- and bis(stannyl)                  enynes for syntheses of beta-alkylidene-gamma-butyrolactones                    and beta, gamma-unsaturated valerolactones.  The biological                     activities of these hitherto not readily accessible systems                     remain to be explored.  The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling                  reactions of stannyl enynes with electrophiles will be                          investigated to gain access to stereodefined conjugated                         ene-dienes, yne-dienes, and ene-diynes whose structural                         features occur in many fungal metabolites, which possess                        antibiotic activity;                                                            (c) preparation of chiral 3-borolenes and investigation of                      their use as templates for effecting acyclic stereocontrol with                 concomitant control of absolute stereochemistry in syntheses of                 quaternary carbon centers and compounds having three                            consecutive stereogenic centers.",
