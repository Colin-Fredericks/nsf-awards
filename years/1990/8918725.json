 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wide range of space and time scales of atmospheric                     motions poses a fundamental challenge in numerical weather                      prediction and modeling.  Not only is there spatial differences                 in phenomena such as fronts and cyclones, but also in the types                 of wave motions which occur.  Solving the equations of motion                   efficiently and in a way that avoids the development of                         spurious solutions is quite complex.                                                 The overall goal of this research is to investigate the                    potential application of multigrid methods to atmospheric                       models as a means of overcoming some of these difficulties.                     The study will concentrate on two main areas.  First, the                       principal investigator will extend his current results on fast                  multigrid solvers for nonlinear elliptic problems by developing                 a multigrid solver for the semigeostrophic invertibility                        relation in three dimensions.  The coupling of the multigrid                    processing with adaptive mesh refinement based on the estimated                 local truncation error will also be studied in this model.                      Second, multigrid acceleration of semi-implicit time                            differencing in primitive equation models will be investigated.",
