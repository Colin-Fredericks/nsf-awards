 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will test a model that predicts higher               rates of encounter between zooplankton and their prey in                        turbulent than still water. If this model is correct, feeding and               egg production rates od copepods should increase as turbulence                  increases, provided food in limiting. Experiments will be run in                100-1 microcosms using three species of copepod and three levels                of turbulence established using a pair of vibrating grids, with                 mesh separating the copepods from the grids. Preliminary                        measurements will be made to establish the range and spatial                    distribution of turbulence. Food concentration will be limiting,                except in high-                                                                 food containers that will control for direct, physical effects of               the turbulence on the copepods. The model will be supported by                  significant increases of egg production or feeding with                         increasing turbulence in treatments with limiting food                          concentrations. This result would have implications for the                     effect of the physical environment on copepods and how they                     obtain their food in the sea. In addition, it may call into                     question the applicability of many experiments on the feeding and               growth of copepods in bottles.",
