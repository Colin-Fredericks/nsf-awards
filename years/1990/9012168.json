 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colonial species unlike aclonal species of ten generate new                     colonies a sexually through fission or fragmentation. This form                 of vegaetative reproduction plays an important role in                          determining species abundances and community structure. Thus,                   an understanding of vegetative reproduction and the conditions                  under which it is successful is a necessary component of the                    study of marine communities. Vegetative reproduction also has                   important effects on population genetics and these effects may                  control the resilience of species to changes in climate.                                                                                                        Previous work on vegetative reproduction has focused on                         quantifying the effect of vegetative propagation on short term                  population dynamics within single populations. That work has                    not considered the effects of clonal growth on the production                   of new clones nor the selective pressures for propagules which                  can disperse between habitats. In the proposed research I will                  complement work on vegetative reproduction among Caribbean                      gorgonians with new data on larval production, dispersal,                       survival and settlement. These data will allow me to determine                  the interaction between vegetative reproduction, sexual                         reproduction and the dispersal of larvae to new habitats. The                   data will provide a quantitative basis for understanding the                    effects of vegetative reproduction on marine communities.",
