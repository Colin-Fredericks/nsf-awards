 "awd_abstract_narration": "A network of Macintosh computers and software is outfitting a                   microcomputer teaching laboratory that is used to encourage students to         \"do\" science rather than learn about science. Using simulation                  (Stella), graphics (Systat), and computer-aided instruction (Bioquest),         students build and modify their own simulation models of biological and         chemical phenomena as well as anlayze and present their own                     experimental data from laboratory exercises. The focus is on posing and         testing hypotheses that explore the major conceptual issues of several          scientific disciplines. The facility will be used in 11 courses.                Workshops are planned for area high school students and teachers as             well as college and university faculty. The college will contribute an          amount equal to the award.",
