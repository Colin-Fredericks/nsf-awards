 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental physical laws that govern the equilibrium and                   non-equilibrium collective phenomena of a clean surface near the                melting temperature, and of an adsorbed overlayer will be                       investigated using the high resolution low-energy electron                      diffraction technique (HRLEED).  They propose to study the change               of structural and thermodynamic properties of clean metal                       surfaces during surface roughening/melting using HRLEED.                        Research efforts will include:  (1) identification of the nature                of the disorder and measurement of the density of defects                       generated at the surface near the melting temperature; (2)                      measurement of the short range correlations and critical                        exponents associated with the surface roughening/melting phase                  transition.  For an adsorbed overlayer, research efforts will                   include (1) quantitative determination of overlayer domain growth               during the relaxation of statistical mechanical states far from                 equilibrium; (2) testing of 2-D kinetic scaling theory and                      universality for an overlayer with ground state degeneracy                      greater than two; and (3) effects of impurities (random fields)                 on 2-D phase transitions and domain growth of a system with                     ground state degeneracy greater than two.  The results of this                  research will not only help us gain insight into the fundamental                power, scaling and growth laws which describe the clean surface                 and adsorbed overlayer ordering, but will also increase our                     knowledge in controlling important practical processes such as                  crystal growth and heterogeneous catalysis.",
