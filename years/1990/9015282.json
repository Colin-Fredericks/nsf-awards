 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM) and more recently,                   Optical Coordinate Measuring Machines (OCCM) are gaining rapid                  acceptance in U.S. industry, particularly the automotive                        industry, because of its high-speed capability of dimensional                   measurement.  If properly applied, CMM, and OCMMs can be used to                dramatically improve product quality by enabling accurate and                   inexpensive 100% in-process measurement and continuously                        monitoring the manufacturing processes thus providing a way to                  process improvement. This is an essential step in retaining U.S.                competitiveness in the world. The need for such a center was                    evidenced by the industrial support generated during the planning               grant phase (ECD 9015282) of the center development.  Today there               are over 100 different companies marketing these systems in the                 U.S. and over the next decade the annual sales should exceed $1.2               billion.                                                                             The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on                     Coordinate Measuring Machines and Optical Coordinate Measuring                  Machines at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will perform                research on the use and application of CMMs and OCCMs in                        improving quality of products, particularly those related to the                automotive industry.                                                                 The Program Manager recommends that the University of                      Michigan at Ann Arbor be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a                five year continuing grant.                                                          Near the end of each twelve month period, the Program                      Manager and/or the Directors of the Engineering Centers Division                reviews the progress of the center on a number of renewal                       criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which the                      Industry/University interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend                  support of the next period of this continuing grant.",
