 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances the junior and senior-level Mechanical                    Engineering laboratory facilities to better prepare students as                 mechanical engineers in industry, government, and academia.  The                goal of this project is the development of a computer-networked                 automated data acquisition and analysis system for undergraduate                students.  Personal computers are linked to measurement, data                   acquisition and data reduction instruments via an IEEE-488 bus as               well as the University of Texas Center for High Performance                     Computing.  This networked system's capabilities allows expanded                coverage of traditional topics and permits the introduction of                  appropriate advanced measurement and signal processing techniques.              The efficiencies inherent in the integrated computer system enable              students to more productively combine analysis with design.  This               facilitates the traditional, iterative design process thereby                   allowing incorporation of optimization techniques.                                                                                                              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
