 "awd_abstract_narration": "Local populations of the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae                 Rossi and Strong apparently become extinct and are re-established               by immigrants frequently, as indicated by our work with this new                species of fly.  Patches of the sole host plant, sea oxeye daisy                (Borrichia frutescens) are all small and discrete.  There are no                vast \"mainland\" patches, and gall-midge populations contributing                colonists to locally extinct populations are about the size of                  those that have become extinct.  The investigator posit that this               is a true \"metapopulation\" system (sensu Levins 1970), in which                 persistence is due to recolonization after local extintion among                roughly even-sized patches.                                                          Parasitoids are a major threat but are spotty in their                     effects.  In excess of 95% parasitism occurs in some sea oxeye                  patches, while other patches have much lower rates.  Patches with               temporarily low parasitism rates are likely to provide immigrant                to extinct local midge populations.                                                  Three sets of experiments will assess metapopulation                       dynamics.  (1) Forced extinction of midges in natural sea Oxeye                 patches and (2) creation of new patches in salt marsh will                      indicate the role of natural immigration in persistence.  (3) New               patches of sea oxeye daisy, created in bayou areas far inland                   from natural midge population, will permit comparisons of                       persistence, with and without parasitoids, in the absemce of                    midge immigration.  This investigation will yield critical                      information regarding scales of interactions important to many                  biological system    //",
