New techniques have been developed for                      studying plasma disturbances in the inner heliosphere.  This                    research will continue to investigate the physics of these                      disturbances, using data from the HELIOS zodiacal-light                         photometers and a variety of other coronal instruments. The                     zodiacal-light photometers have already provided the first                      stereoscopic information about the heliospheric shape of these                  disturbances.  Modelling techniques will also be employed to                    interpret and fit the observed results.  The HELIOS imaging                     combined with other observations should provide a unique                        opportunity to determine coronal mass-ejection velocities,                      streamer material velocities, 3D structures, and total masses in                the interplanetary medium.  This can be done with fewer                         assumptions and more accuracy than previously possible.  Besides                mass ejections, solar disturbances which reach the                              interplanetary medium also include coronal streamers, shocks, and               co-rotating interaction regions,  It has been possible to view                  these features with the zodiacal-light photometers on board the                 HELIOS spacecraft and these will be studied to determine how they               relate to near-surface solar structures and the heliospheric                    current sheet.  The study will be extended to include comparisons               of the HELIOS photometer observations with other remote sensing                 observations including those of kilometric radio bursts and                     interplanetary scintillations provided by the Cambridge, England                scintillation array.  ***  //",
