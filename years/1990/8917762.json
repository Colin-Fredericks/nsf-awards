The questions to be addreses include: 1) What is the                  segmentation geometry of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South                    Atlantic and what is the relative abundance of first and second                 order discontinuities? 2) How does the segmentation geometry                    observed along a representative length of ridge compare with the                early segmentation character of the South Atlantic in terms of                  the distribution of first and second order discontinuities? 3)                  What are the structual and kinematic characteristics associated                 with a change in plate boundary geometry and the creation of a                  second-order discontinuity? 4) What are the strutural and                       morphologic characteristics associated with the trnsfromation of                a first-order discontinuity to a second-order  discontinuity and                what is the age of the offset when the boundary no longer behaves               rigily? 5) What are the morphotectonic characteristics associated               with evolution of a second-order discontinuity to a third-order                 discontinuity? 6) What is the distribution of rifted and non-                   rifted ridge segments along the MAR between 22S and 34S?",
