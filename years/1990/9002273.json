The objective is to obtain data on soil                                         failures in the Marina District of San                                          Francisco: this perishable data will be                                         analyzed at a later date with the objective                                     of developing a simple and efficient                                            technique to assess the stability and                                           displacement of liquefied soils.                                                                                                                                The observations are designed to provide data                                   on ground failures which can lead to answers                                    to the following questions:                                                     1. Are sand boils related to the damage                                         caused by liquefaction?                                                         2. Do the sand boils in the Marina District                                     form a pattern or are they randomly                                             distributed?                                                                    3. Is there a relation between the                                              superficial ground displacement, soil profile                                   and the size of the sand boils, their                                           relative spatial frequency and distribution?                                    4. Is it possible to reconstruct the failure                                    mechanisms within soil layers by examining                                      the sand boils?",
