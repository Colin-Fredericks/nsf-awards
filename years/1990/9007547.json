 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is aimed at developing a                             comprehensive theory of the geometrical foundations that underlie               the dynamics of highly nonlinear control system, that can only                  very poorly be described by linear approximations.  It is                       intended to focus first on the practical purposes of feedback                   stabilization of highly-nonlinear systems.  Of particular                       immediate interest is a generalization of the classical zero-                   dynamics manifold only by some high-order condition (immediately                related to tracking through singularities).  This is envisioned                 to parallel the development of condition for controllability,                   from linear, over first order nonlinear to eventually high-order                nonlinear conditions.  A second main direction involves the                     development of tools in terms of elements of a free Lie algebra                 (and the relations they satisfy) that allow one to concisely                    describe conditions for stabilizability, and also characterize                  controllability and optimality.  Most important are the                         characterization of filtrations and of bases of a free nilpotent                Lie algebra (on a finite number of generators) that are suitable                for the problems considered.  This work is a continuation of a                  research program that has expanded from controllability, to the                 visualization of geometrical and topological properties of the                  control system.",
