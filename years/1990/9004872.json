 "awd_abstract_narration": "An eighteen month study of taphonomic and sedimentologic                   processes in a modern marine carbonate environment will be                      conducted.  PIs will assess the biologic and physical and                       sedimentologic characteristics of six diverse environments in                   Graham's Harbor, Bahamas.  The objectives of the study are (1) to               contrast and compare rates of taphonomic loss from a variety of                 carbonate environments within Graham's Harbor with those measured               rates along the Texas coast--are loss rates in clastic                          environments different than those in carbonate environments?                    Loss rates in carbonate environments may be less than in clastic                environments.  If loss rates are less, then the death assemblage                and by analyogy, the fossil record, might contain more of the                   original thought. (2) to recognize transported assemblages on a                 very fine environmental scale--we will quantify transport between               and within habitat in Graham's Harbor.  The techniques developed                and perfected in this study should be transferable to the                       analysis of fossil outcrops.  (3) size frequency analysis of the                living community and death assemblage--do carbonate death                       assemblages contain a more accurate representation of the                       population dynamics of the living community than in clastic                     environments?  (4) Taphonomic signatures of the biota from six                  distinct environments in Graham's Harbor will be determined and                 compared with the sedimentary record.  How closely do                           sedimentologic parameters reflect taphonomic properties?",
