 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pathways and fluxes for phosphoryl transfer to and from the                 guanine nucleotide pools within mitochondrial matrix is being                   determined by tracer experiments and kinetic modeling.                          Mitochondria will be isolated from tissues and species which                    differ in the presence and absence of phosphoenolpyruvate                       carboxykinase and in the use of ATP/ADP vs. GTP/GDP by succinate                thiokinase.  Matrix preparations from mitochondria are assayed                  for nucleoside diphosphate kinase, nucleoside monophosphate                     kinases including adenylate kinase, GTP-AMP phosphotransferase,                 and guanylate kinase, and GTP-utilizing enzymes such as those                   which activate medium-chain fatty acids.  In these assays, HPLC                 is used to separate and quantitate all nucleotide substrates and                products.  The results will be used to develop a kinetic model                  for nucleotide metabolism in mitochondrial matrix which will take               into account the activity of nucleoside diphosphate kinase in the               matrix space, the probability that the GTP:GDP and ATP:ADP ratios               are maintained at different values, and the sources and                         disposition of GTP in mitochondrial matrix reactions.                                                                                                           The mitochondrion is the subcellular organelle of energy                        metabolism.  This \"energy factory\" plays a crucial role in cell                 metabolism by providing energy for all vital functions.  It is                  surprising that after several decades of intensive research, a                  key question still exists about how one pool of metabolites is                  regulated.  This research applies to new technologies of                        measuring individual enzymes and reactants to answer the                        remaining questions of regulation.",
