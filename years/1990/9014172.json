 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in the History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science.             The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding junior and senior                 investigators who come from each of these three areas.  The funds               provided by this award will provide stipends for graduate students              and postdoctoral fellows, and will defray part of the cost of the               trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase                specialized library resources and research equipment to be used by              trainees, and to bring investigators from other research and                    academic institutions for short term visits and seminars.  The                  areas of research that the training program addresses include the               constitution of scientific disciplines, the scientific workplace,               authority and credibility in science, naturalistic epistemology,                scientific and technological networks, and scientific controversy.                                                                                              As scientific research and its fruits have come to play an                      increasingly important, if not central, role in the everyday life               of modern society, interest in understanding the methods and                    motivations of scientific researchers has also grown.                           Traditionally, such studies of science itself have been done by                 the scientists themselves; increasingly, the investigators of the               phenomenon of science have come from ranks of those with formal                 backgrounds in history, philosophy or sociology.  Though this has               provided for more sophisticated analyses, the lack of individuals               trained in more than one of these areas has resulted in an often                narrow view of scientific practice and its evolution.  This award               will provide funds for the training of a new generation of                      investigators of science able to pose questions and investigate                 phenomena that cross the boundaries and elude the paradigms of                  these more traditional approaches to the study of science.",
