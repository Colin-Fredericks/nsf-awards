 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will demonstrate the plausibility               of an approach to investigating the formation of shear bands in                 stressed materials that involves the construction of a model of                 pure shear using the Arrhenius Law for plasticity and the method                of high energy asymptotics.  Previous mathematical analysis of                  shear-band formation has included a complete numerical                          investigation of the growth of perturbations into shear bands and               a stability analysis of the homogeneous-shear solution.  The                    results of this work have shown reasonably good agreement with                  experimental data, but an understanding of this underlying                      mechanism of band formation has been missing.  The principal                    investigator will seek to provide such an understanding by means                of the proposed modelling approach.                                                  Many physical processes are at work during the formation of                shear bands in stressed materials.  Up to now applied                           mathematicians and engineers have relied largely on two                         approaches to understanding these processes.  The first approach                involves performing experiments on actual stressed materials,                   while the second approach involves solving numerically the                      systems of partial differential equations that govern the                       material.  Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but                  neither one is able to give a satisfactory explanation of the                   basic physical mechanisms that govern band formation.  The                      principal investigator will employ a different approach based                   upon modelling the materials with a simpler set of equations and                extracting more useful information with the aid of certain                      asymptotic methods.",
