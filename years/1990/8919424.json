 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Horace Smith will use this grant to study variable stars in a               specific area of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  One hundred and             one previously known variables and two hundred and five newly                   discovered, suspected variables will be included in this survey.                This will not only be one of the most extensive studies of SMC                  variables to date in terms of the number of stars studied, but it               will extend fainter than almost all other investigations of SMC                 field variable stars.  For the first time the period-luminosity                 relations and period-frequency histogram of the faintest SMC                    Cepheid stars will be established.  Questions relating to the                   nature and distribution of SMC RR Lyrae stars will also be                      explored.                                                                                                                                                       Cepheid stars in the Magellanic Clouds played a significant role                in the discovery of the period-luminosity relation.  They also                  helped outline the structure of the Magellanic Clouds, and they                 have served to test both stellar pulsation theory and stellar                   evolution theory.  For these reasons the Magellanic Cloud Cepheids              have been favorite targets of observers.  Dr. Smith's study will                expand the data base on SMC Cepheids and RR Lyraes to better                    understand their nature, evolution, and distribution.",
