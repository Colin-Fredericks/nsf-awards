 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oceanic crust has frequently been modeled as relatively                     uniform in thickness with a characteristic velocity structure                   composed of linear gradients that do not generate reflectors in                 vertical incidence seismic profiling. Recently, however, improved               profiling techniques and data processing capabilities have                      revealed that the lower oceanic crust in some regions has a                     distinct suite of low-angle dipping reflectors. A few of these                  events cross the entire crustal section and may terminate at                    depth in the uppermost mantle. The distribution and origin of                   these events is critical to understanding the processes that form               the oceanic crust and the subsequent development of the stress                  field in the oceanic plate.                                                                                                                                     The present award will analyze previously collected data in the                 vicinity of ODP site 504B in the eastern equatorial Pacific.                    Future drilling is planned at this site to extend the hole into                 the lower crust. Analysis of the seismic reflection data will                   allow the drilling results to be placed in a proper regional                    context and should provide constraints on the nature of the crust               producing the reflectors. The project represents the first                      research support to Dr. Zehnder who has recently completed her                  doctoral research on the deep crustal structure in the North                    Atlantic.",
