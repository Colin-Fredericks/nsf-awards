 "awd_abstract_narration": "All plasmas are subject to a variety of instabilities, irrespective of          the type of devices in which these are produced and their intended              applications.  These include plasma sources for neutral, electron and           ion beams, any type of arc discharge, plasma etching devices for solid          state processing, basic experimental devices, geophysical and                   astrophysical plasma and fusion machines.  The deleterious                      consequences of the instabilities are many:  non-uniformities in                plasma, increased transport and, if violent enough, a macroscopic               break up.  These can lead minimally to degradation of the performance           of the device or system and sometimes to its break down.  Therefore             the elimination of these instabilities is always desirable and                  sometimes imperative.  This project continues research into active              feedback control of plasma instabilities.  Specifically, a new remote           suppressor using a small ion beam will be used, which will have                 minimal perturbation to the system.  Robust controllers will also be            studied.  Applications of these controllers to industrial plasma                devices will be explored.  Two faculty members and one graduate                 student will carry out the proposed research using the facilities of            the Columbia University Plasma Research Laboratory.  The experimental           work will utilize the redesigned Columbia Linear Machine.",
