 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of high resolution measurements on simple atoms                  and molecules will be continued, concentrating especially on                    the two-electron systems molecular hydrogen and atomic helium.                  The experimental methods involve multiphoton excitation of                      both ground state and metastable species.  A pulse-amplified cw                 dye laser is used to obtain the high powers required for                        multiphoton excitation while retaining high resolution.  The                    dissociation energy and ionization potential of hydrogen will                   be determined to a new accuracy, and improved measurements will                 be made of the structure of helium.  These measurements will                    provide the first stringent tests of calculations of quantum                    electrodynamic effects in the ground states of two-electron                     systems.  Microwave-optical double resonance will be used to                    precisely measure transitions between high Rydberg states.                           A major focus on this research will be the interaction of                  excited states in hydrogen with the ionization and dissociation                 continua, including the effects of doubly excited states.  The                  decay of Rydberg states will be studied both with and without                   external electric fields.  Work will continue on the                            photodissociation of hydrogen very near threshold, which yields                 detailed information on long-range interactions between atoms.",
