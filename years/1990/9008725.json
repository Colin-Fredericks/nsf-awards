 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until recently, one could expect the proof that a problem has a                 polynomial time solution to include an algorithm that could be used to          obtain the solution.  Now, however, a number of problems, including             many from the VLSI domain, are known to have low degree                         polynomial-time decision algorithms, yet the algorithms themselves              are not known. These algorithms depend on the existence of a finite             but unknown number of forbidden graphs (an obstruction set).  This              research examines the question of whether full knowledge of an                  obstruction set is really required to solve problems in practice.                                                                                               This research focuses on the gate matrix layout problem.  Since some            obstruction sets for the problem are known, the feasibility of                  designing algorithms that utilize only part of those sets of graphs             will be studied.  This will include identification of those                     obstructions likely to be found in practice and the design and                  implementation of algorithms to test for containment of those graphs.           It also examines which techniques used to isolate the ostructions for           gate matrix layout can be applied to other layout permutation                   problems as well.",
