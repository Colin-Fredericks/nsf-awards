 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to describe the                       molecular mechanisms that regulate cerebellar granule cell                      maturation.  This project focuses on the role of                                neurotransmitters in the induction of neuronal differentiation                  during neuron-glial interaction in mouse cerebellar development.                                                                                                1. The investigators will characterize the signal transduction                  cascade by which L-glutamate, presumably released from granule                  neurons, stimulates astroglial cells to release taurine, which in               turn stimulates granule neurons.  This will be studied in in                    vitro systems that allow analysis and manipulation of neuronal                  migration and aggregation.  The neurological mutant mouse                       \"weaver\", which has deficient concentrations of glutamate and                   taurine during development, will be used as a model.                                                                                                            2. The investigators will subsequently determine which cell types               synthesize and take up taurine, by means of immunocytochemistry                 and autoradiography.                                                                                                                                            3. The induction of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc by taurine               and glutamate will be studied during early postnatal development.               C-fos induction will be related to the ability of taurine to                    prevent cell death in weaver and after excitotoxic reactions.",
