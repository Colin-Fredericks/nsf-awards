 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for the support of a workshop                                    to discuss the simulation of earthquake                                         strong ground motions using geotechnical                                        centrifuges.                                                                                                                                                    Geotechnical centrifuge modeling is a means                                     of testing physical models of earth                                             structures - such as embankments and dams -                                     in the laboratory: it does this by correctly                                    simulating the effect of gravity-induced                                        stresses on the strength and stiffness                                          properties of soil.  These stresses increase                                    with depth, just as water pressure increases                                    with depth below the surface.  Subjecting an                                    N-th scale earth model to N times the                                           acceleration due to gravity yields the                                          correct gravity-induced stresses.                                                                                                                               The state-of-the-art in geotechnical                                            centrifuge modeling has progressed rapidly                                      during the last decade.  Especially important                                   is the fact that during this decade, a new                                      generation of geotechnical engineers has been                                   trained with an appreciation of, and                                            experience in using, this method.  An                                           exciting development has been the recent use                                    of geotechnical centrifuges to simulate                                         earthquake-induced strong ground motions.                                       This development has the potential to make a                                    dramatic contribution to earthquake hazard                                      mitigation.                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this workshop is to explore                                    the issues involved in adding an earthquake                                     simulation capability to the three large                                        national geotechnical centrifuges at the                                        University of California at Davis, the                                          University of Colorado at Boulder and at                                        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New                                   York.  Participants include representatives                                     from academe, federal and state agencies,                                       industry, and from major geotechnical                                           centrifuge installations in foreign                                             countries.  The workshop is to be held at the                                   University of Colorado at Boulder on 12-13                                      February 1990:  a report summarizing the                                        discussions, conclusions and recommendations                                    will be distributed following the workshop.",
