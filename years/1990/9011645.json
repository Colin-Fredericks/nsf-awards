 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the                National Science Foundation (NSF) have agreed that limited                      subsidy would be provided to guest observers on the Infrared                    Telescope Facility (IRTF).  NASA provides visitor support for                   NASA related research which occupies approximately 50 percent of                the observing time.  The remaining observing time is available                  for observational programs of general scientific interest.  The                 NSF provides funds for visitor support for the non-NASA mission                 related research.  The support consists of (1) payment of food                  and lodging costs for three members of a visiting observing team;               (2) the cost of transportation of sponsored visitors from Hilo to               the Mid-Level Facility and the summit of Mauna Kea; (3) payment                 for half of the costs of publishing the results of the research                 conducted on the IRTF; and (4) the cost of the cryogens used by                 the scientists for their observations.                                                                                                                          The Infrared Telescope Facility is located at an altitude of                    approximately 13,500 feet near the summit of Mauna Kea on the                   Island of Hawaii.  Mauna Kea was selected as the site of the IRTF               because it is clearly one of the world's best accessible sites                  for infrared observations.  The IRTF is being operated as a                     nationally available facility for astronomical research by the                  University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy under an annually                renewable contract which provides for complete NASA funding for                 all operating costs.",
