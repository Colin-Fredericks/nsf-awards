 "awd_abstract_narration": "The patch clamp has revolutionized the study of                                 electrophysiology, but little is currently known about the                      structure of patches.  Knowledge of structure is important for                  proper interpretation of single channel data, especially data                   from mechanosensitive ion channels, where the cytoskeleton plays                a major role in activating the channel.  By combining                           electrophysiology, light and electron microscopy of patches,                    general techniques for understanding patch structure will be                    developed.  These techniques will aid in determining the                        structural alterations that occur in the preparation of a patch                 for electron microscopy and the structure of the interface                      between the membrane and pipette.  Images of \"living\" patches                   will be made using optical microscopy with high magnification                   video.  To observe the ultrastructure, a device will be built to                rapidly freeze the patch after light microscopic examination.                   After freeze drying, patches will be examined as whole mounts in                the high voltage electron microscope.  Comparison of patch images               will be made with light and electron microscopy, using two                      dimensional projection images, stereo pairs, and complete three                 dimensional image sets.  Techniques for freeze fracturing,                      etching and replicating fragments of pipette tips will be                       developed to study the interaction that occurs between the                      membrane and the wall of the pipette.  Examination of several                   types of cells will aid in determining which structures are                     general and which structures represent tissue-specific                          differences between patches.  Since the patch clamp and the                     electron microscope have the potential for describing single                    molecules, cross correlating results from both techniques will                  lead to a new level of structure-function relationships.",
