This Conference in                       cooperation with the Associations for Computing Machinery                       (ACM), will be held in Jerusalem, Israel from October 22 to                     25, 1990.  The JCIT, held periodically since 1971, is a major                   international conference.  It attracts a broad audience of                      computer scientist, engineers, practitioners, users and                         managers.  The Conference is sponsored by the Information                       Processing Association of Israel and the IEEE Computer Society                  Brenabin Israel.                                                                     Like its four predecessors in 1971, 1974, 1978 and 1984,                   the 5th JCIT will cover a broad range of topics with emphasis                   on the technologies of the 90's.  The goals of the JCIT are to                  provide a broad-based forum for the presentation of                             achievements and innovative ideas in the various areas of                       information technology.                                                              The conference provides an interdisciplinary environment                   for computer scientists, engineers, practitioners, users and                    managers to exchange views and ideas, and to discuss their                      likely impact on information systems of the next decade.                        Participants also have the opportunity to become acquainted                     with the achievements of Israel as a fast developing country in                 the computer and related fields and to meet colleagues in                       Israel.  To this end, JCIT-5 will be held in conjunction with                   the 25th National Conference of the Israeli Systems Analyst                     Association.  The Conference will also display new trends in                    information technology by means of an extensive exhibit of                      computer hardware and software products.                                             More than 40 countries have been represented at the                        previous conferences and an even larger participation is                        expected at JCIT-5.  An attendance of over 3,000 from Israel                    and 600 from abroad is anticipated.",
