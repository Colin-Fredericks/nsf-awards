 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor James M. Bobbitt and members of                his research group at the University of Connecticut to collaborate              with Professor Tetsuo Osa, Pharmaceutical Institute, Tohoku                     University, Sendai, Japan, and colleagues, over a period of two                 years.  The scientists will cooperate in preparing and utilizing                special graphite felt electrodes coated with various catalysts,                 in particular, organic nitroxides, to carry out preparative,                    specific oxidations of organic molecules.  These electrodes have                very high surface areas, which make them especially valuable in                 preparing significant amounts of compounds through electrosynthesis.            Furthermore, by selecting nitroxides with chiral (left-handed or                right-handed) characteristics, i.e., distinguished only by the                  spatial arrangement of constituent groups around one or more                    atoms in the molecule, it may be possible to create catalytic                   electrodes capable of carrying out stereo-specific reactions.                   Such coated electrodes might, for example, be used to produce one               enantiomer in preference to another, or to catalyze the oxidation               of one of a pair of enantiomers.  The work has practical                        applications in synthetic organic chemistry, particularly if                    preparative-scale procedures can be developed.                                                                                                                  The U.S. and Japanese scientists in this effort have complementary              strengths.  Professor Bobbitt is a synthetic organic chemist.                   Professor Osa ia an electroanalytical chemist, with experience in               attaching various chemical species to graphite electrodes.  Together            they hope to make significant progress toward their goal of                     developing chiral catalyst-coated electrodes which can be used to               carry out enantioselective oxidations and stereospecific formation              of chiral centers in selected molecules.",
