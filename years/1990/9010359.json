 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal offers new insights into the relationship between                 task characteristics and negotiation behavior.  Negotiations                    frequently result in suboptimal, inefficient agreements;                        negotiators could have reach other settlements that all would have              preferred.  Unlike prior research, the focus in this proposal is                on the impact of perceptual and judgmental factors on the process               and outcome of negotiations.                                                                                                                                    The research investigates how the structure of negotiation tasks                is determined by negotiator's cognitive characteristics.                        Relatively slight differences in how negotiators evaluate the                   desirability of potential settlements may result in distinctly                  different feasible settlement spaces and efficient frontiers.                   Research will be conducted to asses the behavioral implications of              these different task structures.  The research will make use of                 both empirical and simulation studies, combining elements of                    psychological, decision theoretic, and game theoretic approaches                to the study of negotiation.  The objective of the proposal is to               lead to greater understanding of the structure of negotiation tasks             and their impacts on negotiation processes and outcomes.  The                   results of this research will help guide the development of                     computer-based negotiation support systems.",
