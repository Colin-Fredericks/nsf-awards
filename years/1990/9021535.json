 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Comprehensive Alliance for Minority Participation will be an              intersegmental program involving the University of California, Irvine           and over two dozen other public and private institutions.  It will              have a considerable concentration on the undergraduate biological               sciences and will also include an emphasis on chemistry, mathematics,           and physics.  A prototype of linkages, between each of the \"pieces\" of          the science careers pipeline, it builds upon earlier successful                 partnerships initiated in the region by UC Irvine.  It will enable              close to 1,000 underrepresented minorities to participate in                    collaborative research activities in the sciences each year.  It                involves numerous senior faculty who are themselves representatives of          minority groups serving as role models in the conduct of research and           as mentors.  It includes (1) A Minority Undergraduate Research Fellows          Program involving students at UC Irvine and several other public and            private 4-year colleges and universities--a program undertaken in               cooperation with distinguished scientists on the campus and in the              region, (2) A Community College Alliance motivating minority                    enrollment in scientific disciplines and fostering articulation                 between science majors in 2-year and 4-year institutions, and (3)               ASecondary School Outreach Program providing stimulating science                programs for minority students, parents and teachers.  The Alliance             assures that programs focused at the undergraduate level are connected          with a broader series of longitudinal pipeline efforts.  It draws upon          sizable private sector resources and includes linkages with business            and industry, foundations, state and Federal agencies, and                      professional associations.  It will be characterized by the long-term           commitment of participants, its high level Advisory Council creating            sustained cooperation among participating entities, shared governance           of alliance activities, coequal participation within project                    activities, a focused action plan with specific longitudinal                    objectives, and an ongoing commitment to data collection and                    evaluation to assess Alliance progress and effects.  Black,                     Chicano/Latino and Native American students will benefit substantially          from the program.
