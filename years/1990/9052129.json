 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Psychology Department at the                   University of Connecticut to purchase equipment which will help                 improve the introductory psychology sequence at the University.                 The school has already funded a pilot program (tested in General                Psychology 1) which provided some student computer stations, one                network file server and one instructor's station.  The pilot                    program extended control over stimulus presentation, data                       collection and data analysis.  New programs were written and                    existing programs modified to increase the range and complexity of              the experiments which formed the core of the labs.  This award will             allow the program to be expanded to give all students the                       opportunity to participate in the Computer Assisted Laboratory for              Introductory Psychology.  It will also enhance the pilot software               and develop new software to enrich the understanding of                         experimentation and increase the level of computer literacy of                  primarily freshman and sophomore students.  The grantee is matching             this award with non-Federal sources.",
