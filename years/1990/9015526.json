 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                         Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of               eleven winners under that competition.                                          In distributed decision environments, intelligent agents at network             nodes interact with private databases, common databases, and each               other to coordinate their independent actions.  This project                    explores how certain human, organizational, and technological                   elements in a distributed corporate planning setting, condition the             level of coordination and integration of the agents' individual                 plans.  The researchers work with the  Management Systems Research              Group of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to develop, test and               evaluate decision support facilities for their individual,                      autonomous planning decisions.  The researchers evaluate the                    outcomes of systems use among a set of interdependent business unit             managers in terms of the coordination and integration of their                  individual plans taken as a whole, as well as the level of trust,               commitment, understanding a cooperation they experience in this                 distributed planning setting.  The distributed decision making of               these autonomous, yet interdependent, agents is a setting of very               high equivocality and uncertainty.  the research is action-based,               selectively adding structure and feedback capabilities to increase              the richness of communication supported by the systems.  It is a                theory driven, empirical, investigation of how increased                        communication richness of a decision support facility affects the               experience and outcome of a distributed planning systems.",
