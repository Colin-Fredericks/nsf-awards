 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will continue a program aimed at accurate                 theoretical prediction of the properties of strongly-interacting                quantum many-body systems, at the microscopic level defined by                  the basic forces between the constituents.  The systems of                      interest include superfluid liquid helium-four unpolarized and                  polarized liquid helium-three, spin-aligned bulk atomic hydrogen                and deuterium, nuclear matter, neutron matter, nuclei, and                      strongly-coupled electronic systems.  Both static and dynamic                   properties of selected examples, notably the helium liquids,                    nuclei, and nuclear matter, will be calculated.  Special emphasis               is placed on predictions which can be compared with the results                 of current experiments designed to probe the correlation                        structure of many-body systems.  Such experiments include deep-                 inelastic neutron scattering from liquid helium (e.g. at the                    Argonne IPNS facility) and inclusive electron scattering from                   nuclei at GeV energies (e.g. at CEBAF).  The basic goal is a                    deeper understanding of the breakdown of meanfield pictures due                 to dynamical correlations.  The primary theoretical tools are the               method of correlated basis functions and self-consistent Green's                function theory, applied in parallel or joint investigations.",
