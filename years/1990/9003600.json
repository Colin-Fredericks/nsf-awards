The gist of this project is to study the effect of rocking                      motion of the earthquake to the structural response.                                                                                                            The rocking component of ground motion is generally                             considered to be small in magnitude and therefore its                           effects are neglected.  There are however certain                               situations where the combined conditions of structures,                         site location, and earthquake motions are such that the                         rocking component becomes important.  In this project, the                      damage distribution will be studied to determine where the                      rocking motion contributed to the damages of the buildings                      which were not designed to account for these additional                         effects.                                                                                                                                                        Geology and soil data of the entire bay area will be used                       to estimate the rocking motion contributions at various                         sites based on the recorded translation motions.  The                           generated data will then be used to analyze different                           structures for rocking response.                                                                                                                                This study will enable engineers to determine rationally                        the importance of rocking motion in the seismic safety of                       structures designed with or without consideration of such                       additional earthquake forces.",
