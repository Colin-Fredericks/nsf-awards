 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                      Francois N. Diederich will investigate  \"Cyclophanes to Study                   Principles of Molecular Recognition in Aqueous Solutions\" in                    the Chemistry Department at the University of California, Los                   Angeles (UCLA).  Molecular recognition is the study of designed                 polymolecular entities and assemblies formed between two or                     more chemical species and held together by intermolecular                       forces, the noncovalent bond.  This fascinating and dynamic                     research area is recognized worldwide as an important                           intellectual and technological frontier in chemistry.  These                    studies will lead to guidelines for the design of new hosts and                 to new insight into the workings of biological molecules.  This                 information is especially valuable for those scientists                         interested in designing new receptors to selectively remove                     toxic molecules from waste waters or bodily fluids in humans.                                                                                                   This study involves a comprehensive synthetic, physical                         organic, and computational approach to explain apolar                           complexation in aqueous solutions.  The role of water will be                   defined in comparative investigations in aqueous and organic                    solutions.  For these studies, a unique series of cyclophane                    receptors with apolar binding cavities is already available,                    and others will be prepared to reach specific objectives.                       Titration microcalorimetry is being used for accurate                           determination of the complete set of thermodynamic quantities                   for apolar complexation processes in aqueous and organic                        solutions.  Hydrogen-deuterium isotope, salt, and buffer                        effects on apolar association are also being studied.",
