 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine the changing relationships                   between work and family behaviors among Puerto Rican women,                     employing both a life course and cohort perspective.  The focus                 is on entry into adult roles (marital, parental, and labor force)               and the consequences of these early adult transitions.  The PIs                 will analyze the detailed retrospective life histories of over                  3,000 Puerto Rican women aged 15 to 49 in 1982, interviewed in                  the Puerto Rico Fertility and family Planning Assessment survey.                They will compare the early adult experiences of different age                  cohorts of women who reached adulthood between the 1950s and the                1970s, the period of most rapid social and economic change in                   Puerto Rico.  Because of improved opportunities for women outside               the home, the investigators expect to find marked changes in the                timing and nature of women's early work and family behavior and                 that the effects of such changes will be greater for younger                    women.  The proposed combined cohort and life course perspective                has not previously been applied to the study of Puerto Rican                    women, a relatively low-income population experiencing rapid                    industrialization.  By examining both their productive and                      reproductive roles from this perspective, the proposed study                    should contribute significantly to our limited understanding of                 life course dynamics and the impact of economic development on                  women.",
