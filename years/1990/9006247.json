 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research addresses an areas of present interest                 in the intercontinental academic networking community.  The                     United States' networking plant is built on a connectionless                    (datagram) service, and the European (and Japanese and other)                   plant(s) are based on connection-oriented service.  The                         implication is that even when we all use the international                      stantdard (ISO/OSI) protocols, our networks will not be able to                 interwork unless the incompatibilities of the underlying network                services are bridged. A European - U.S. workshop addressing the                 issue is scheduled for February, 1990.  The proposed effort would               produce an assessment of the state-of-the-art in bridging between               the two underlying network protocols, in time for use at the                    February meeting.  Such a paper could increase the chances of                   success of the workshop by getting all the attendees off to a                   fast start with a shared view of developments.***                                //",
