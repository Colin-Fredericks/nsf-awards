 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow an anthropologist at the University of                    North Carolina at Chapel Hill to receive technical training in                  geographic information systems and remote sensing.  This training               will be used to help analyze information gathered about                         agriculture, ecology and economics in two communities in the                    Peruvian Andes.  The research seeks to understand how peasant                   populations use strategies such as field dispersion, storage and                exchange to buffer production risk due to drought, frost and crop               pests.  This award will allow the investigator to analyze data on               regional environmental variation that has been available but that               he was not trained to use.                                                                                                                                      The research that this training activity supports is important                  because the understanding of peasant survival strategies is                     critical to the dealings between the U.S. and societies which                   have large peasant populations.   The training is also valuable                 in itself to increase the technical expertise of social                         scientists.",
