 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hans Bethe enjoys the reputation of being one of the most important             and most revered of physicists of the 20th century.  A refugee from             Hitler's Germany, Bethe moved to Cornell University where he played             a major role in the development of quantum theory and its                       application to the structure of atoms, molecules and solids during              the '30s.  He was also one of the principal contributors to the                 elucidation of the content of relativistic quantum mechanics and                quantum electrodynamics until the late 50's. He also made major                 contributions to solid state physics.  During World War II, before              receiving clearance for the Manhattan project, Bethe made                       significant contributions to aerodynamics, penetration of armor by              projectiles, and radar.  Upon joining the Manhattan Project, he                 worked under Oppenheimer on the theoretical design of an atomic                 bomb and eventually was named the head of the theoretical physics               division at the Los Alamos Laboratory.  After the war, he continued             playing a significant science policy role dealing with issues as                divergent as the cold war, the hydrogen bomb, the McCarthy era, the             Korean War, the Oppenheimer affair, Sputnik, the nuclear test ban,              Vietnam, the armament reduction negotiations, SDI, environmental                issues, science education, nuclear energy, etc. In all of these                 issues, Bethe was the voice of the concerned scientist who wished               to use science for achieving peace, not perpetuating war.  Under                this grant,  Professor Schweber is writing, at Bethe's invitation,              an intellectual biography of this great scientist.  The biography               is dealing not only with Bethe's contributions to theoretical and               applied physics, but also is addressing Bethe's activities in the               field of science policy, disarmament and international affairs.",
