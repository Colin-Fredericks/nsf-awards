 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Vincas Steponaitis, Mr. I. Randolph                  Daniel will analyze a body of archaeological material from the                  Hardaway site, located in Stanly County, North Carolina.  The                   results will be incorporated into Mr. Daniel's dissertation                     thesis.  The Hardaway site was excavated in the early 1960's but                the materials recovered have not been fully studied.  These date                from the Archaic period, between 10,500 and 8,000 years ago, and                document the adaptation of Native American peoples to the                       relatively modern biotic community which emerged following the                  last glacial advance.  Mr. Daniel will examine the lithic                       materials recovered.  Through analysis of these artifacts and                   comparison with geological outcrops in the region, he hopes to                  match raw materials to their sources.  This will provide                        information on the geographical range exploited by the Hardaway                 people.  He will also examine collections from other sites in the               region to set the Hardaway site into a broader cultural context.                On this basis, he will reconstruct the Archaic settlement system                in the region and learn how aboriginal groups utilized the                      seasonally changing environment.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on the origins and development of Native American culture.                It will also reveal how human groups at a technologically simple                level adapted to a variable environment and the strategies they                 employed.  Finally, it will aid in the training of an extremely                 promising young scientist.",
