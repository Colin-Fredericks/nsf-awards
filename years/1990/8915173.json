 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. Shi-Kuo Chang of the University of                Pittsburgh in a research collaboration with Prof. G. Tortora of                 the Universita di Salerno, Italy.  The principal objective of the               proposed research is to investigate the fundamental methodologies               and theories of visual languages.  In particular, they propose to               investigate the methodology for the design of a visual language                 compiler, called the SIL-ICON Compiler.  The SIL-ICON Compiler is               a software system for the specification, interpretation, proto-                 typing, and generation of icon-oriented systems.                                                                                                                The design of the SIL-ICON compiler is based upon the theory of                 generalized icons.  A generalized icon is an object with the dual               representation of a logical part (the meaning) and a physical part              (the image).  By bringing together experienced teams of inves-                  tigators to combine resources and talent, this international                    project has the potential not only to provide insights into both                the theoretical understanding of visual languages and visual                    concepts, but also to furnish practical applications in novel user              interface design for database applications.",
