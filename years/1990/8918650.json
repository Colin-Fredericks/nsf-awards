 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaiian Islands with their populations of endemic                     Drosophila species provide an ideal natural laboratory for                      studying evolution and ecological adaptations.  The vitellogenin                or yolk protein genes of these diverse Hawaiian flies comprise an               exceptional model system for analyzing mechanisms and rates of                  gene evolution in higher organisms.  The members of this gene                   cluster, encoding three vitellogenin proteins, are subject to                   strict developmental regulation, which controls timing, tissue-                 specificity and rates of vitellogenin synthesis to coordinate egg               maturation of each species with its particular ecological                       habitat.                                                                             The proposed research will use the most recently developed                 techniques of molecular biology to expedite determination of DNA                sequences of these genes in nine species and assay levels of                    sequence variation within and between populations of two species.               DNA sequence comparisons will identify the molecular basis of                   interspecific differences in vitellogenin gene structure and                    function.  Gene changes between species will be related to                      adaptive shifts in host plants and reproductive strategies, the                 goal being to distinguish the roles played by various types of                  DNA sequences in species evolution.  Comparisons of phylogenies                 constructed using divergence in coding versus control sequences                 will test the hypothesis that regulatory changes in the genome                  are more closely aligned with adaptive and phylogenetic change.",
