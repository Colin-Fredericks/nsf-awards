 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is part of the initiative to collect                      perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                     California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                                                                                                            This is a collaborative project with Professor Jean-Lou                         Chameau at Purdue University.  The Earth Technology                             Corporation, Long Beach, California, is assisting in                            obtaining the field data: in addition Drs. Geoffrey Martin                      and Edward Kavazanjian of Earth Technology Corporation are                      providing technical assistance to the project.  Drs. Clough,                    Chameau, and Kavazanjian during the period 1979-1985                            investigated the soil response and soil failures expected in                    the Bay Area as a result of a large earthquake: however the                     effects observed as a result of the Loma Prieta earthquake                      appear to be more extensive than was expected, in part                          because the ground motions were more severe than anticipated                    from data existing ten years ago.  The project is utilizing                     these previous studies, focusing on the areas that suffered                     significant ground failures, such as the Marina District.                       At the same time it is using the improved understanding of                      ground failure mechanisms that has occurred since the                           original studies were undertaken.                                                                                                                               The objectives of this project are: to gather relevant                          geotechnical data obtained since 1980; to map ground                            features that are important to identify the extent of                           liquefaction and ground amplification effects; perform about                    30 cone penetration tests at locations where earlier tests                      had been conducted; organize the above information into a                       computerized data base; and make preliminary assessments of                     the correlation between field observations and data obtained                    before and after the 1989 earthquake.",
