 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests assistance from the National                             Science Foundation to establish a multiuser Hybridoma                           Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at San                           Antonio (UTSA).  The laboratory will:  (1) enhance and                          strengthen the research capabilities of life science                            faculty by providing expensive, state-of-the-art                                equipment, not presently available, to facilitate the                           application of monoclonal antibody (MAb) technology to                          ongoing and planned research programs; (2) enhance and                          strengthen research experiences for minority undergraduate                      and graduate students by facilitating the acquisition of                        intellectual and physical skills to become competitive in                       an area of biology which is rapidly achieving status as                         required background by the scientific community; and (3)                        foster research interactions between UTSA and other                             regional academic institutions with large minority                              enrollments in the biological sciences.  Furthermore, the                       enhanced research experiences are expected to contribute                        to increased entry of minority students into careers in                         the biosciences.  Initially nine investigators and their                        students propose to utilize the Hybridoma Research                              Laboratory to facilitate the application of MAb technology                      to ongoing research programs in physiology, molecular cell                      biology, genetics, biochemistry and neurobiology.  These                        research programs will impact 14 undergraduate and 7                            graduate minority students per year.//",
