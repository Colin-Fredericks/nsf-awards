 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbonyl compounds are photochemical precursors of ozone                   while carboxylic acids are major sources of acidity and                         therefore control in part pH dependent transformations in                       atmospheric droplets.  Despite the recognized importance of                     these classes of compounds in atmospheric chemistry, much                       uncertainty exists concerning processes in their biogeochemical                 cycling.  The proposed investigation will provide the first                     concurrent gas-phase and aqueous-phase (cloud) measurements of                  carbonyls and organic acids at a rural site.  Three                             institutions, each bringing expertise in specific fields will                   perform a detailed study of in-cloud chemical transformations                   involving these compounds.  This investigation will employ                      various meteorological and vapor- and aqueous-phase chemical                    measurements from an instrumented tower (1014 m elevation)                      situated in the Shenandoah National Park, Virginia.  Intensive                  field sampling will be conducted over a one month period in                     April-May 1990, with later interpretation of the data                           facilitated by state-of-the-art computer modeling of in-cloud                   chemical and physical processes.                                                     The concurrent observations of carbonyls and organic acids                 will be examined for evidence of atmospheric oxidation of                       carbonyls to organic acids, with special focus on the in-cloud                  aqueous-phase oxidation of formaldehyde as a source of formic                   acid.  The observed fractionations of individual compounds                      between the gas phase and the cloudwater phase will be compared                 to those expected from thermodynamic equilibrium.  Two cloud                    droplet size fractions will be collected, which will document                   the size dependence of cloudwater concentrations.  The results                  of this investigation will contribute substantially to our                      knowledge of important processes determining the chemical                       composition of the troposphere.",
