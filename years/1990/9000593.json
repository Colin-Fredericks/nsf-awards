 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the general area of instability in                 various physical systems using advanced mathematical concepts                   from perturbation theory, dynamical systems theory and                          Hamiltonian mechanics.  Among the topics to be considered are the               stability of dispersive wave solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau                   equation and the Zakharov equation, the advective mixing of fluid               trajectories at the onset of chaos in viscous flows and the                     escape of particle trajectories of rotating Hamiltonian systems                 from KAM regions.  The phenomenon of turbulence is perhaps the                  most important and the most difficult problem in fluid dynamics                 today.  In this project the principal investigator will study                   simple models of turbulent flows using techniques from                          perturbation theory and nonlinear mechanics in order to                         understand better how instabilities in flows are magnified to                   the point where the flows go completely unstable and become                     turbulent.  This too is an important problem, predicting where                  and when a flow first becomes turbulent, since very often one                   wants to delay the onset of turbulence for as long as possible.",
