 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mycorrhizae are the mutualistic associations between plant                 roots (or rhizoids) and fungi.  This symbiosis is found in                      virtually every terrestrial habitat on the vast majority of                     plants, and is a vital part of natural and managed ecosystems.                       This grant will provide travel support for the 8th North                   American Conference on Mycorrhizae in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  The               emphasis of this meeting will be integrating the study of                       mycorrhizae with the Plant and Fungal Biology of the 1990's.                         The North American Conference on Mycorrhizae (NACOM),                      occurring approximately every 3 years, has been the major source                of interaction for mycorrhizal researchers since its inception in               1969.  It has become the premier meeting for developing concepts                and applications related to the study of mycorrhizae.  At the                   seventh NACOM (May 1987), in Gainesville Florida, 310 scientists                from 31 countries attended and presented 253 papers.                                 In keeping with the theme of integration with Plant                        Sciences, the meeting will be organized using a hierarchical                    structure that will permit interaction of all interested groups.                On Wednesday, the opening day, the major addresses will be on                   molecular-cellular biology, Thursday will concentrate on                        organismal biology, Friday on community interactions, and                       Saturday on ecosystem processes.  Theoretical and applied                       symposia will be interspersed throughout the week.                                   Special attempts will be made to integrate researchers who                 are actively involved with mycorrhizal work.  Therefore, for each               day, the morning session has been built around an integrative                   session devoted to understanding the major questions and                        approaches at a single hierarchical level.  Afternoons will be                  devoted to symposia organized by the mycorrhizal community.  In                 each case, evenings, have been reserved for posters and informal                discussions.",
