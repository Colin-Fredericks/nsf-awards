 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most engineering structures are being designed to carry specified               service or normal loads.  However, recent developments in computer              technology have created a potential for design of structures                    against the loads expected during the whole cycle of their life.                The structures designed by using this approach will have improved               durability, maintainability and damageability.  Herein, an energy               based damage model will be developed for computation of residual                strength and stiffness of damaged steel structural members.  The                residual strength computations will utilize yield, limit and                    failure surfaces of the member which will be defined in terms of                generalized forces for steel structural members.  For safety                    evaluation of structural systems, a damage analysis computer code               is to be developed.  For increasing the efficiency of the safety                analysis procedure, a stiffness matrix will be derived for the                  damaged member by employing a deflected shape which varies with                 increasing deformations.  The safety  of structural systems will                be evaluated by utilizing a procedure developed by modifying the                existing reliability technique.  The whole procedure of determining             probabilities of damage and failure of structural systems will be               automated.  The above developments will be validated by comparisons             with existing experimental and analytical results.  The developed               damage model and safety analysis algorithm will aid in design of                structural systems based on desired probability of damage and                   failure.  They will also aid in design of steel structural systems              which, under the extreme loads, will avoid concentration of damage              and premature failure.",
