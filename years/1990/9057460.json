 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer code is to be constructed to simulate three-                         dimensional unsteady turbulent reactive flows, based upon a                     spectral element algorithm which combines the accuracy of                       pseudospectral methods with the versatility of finite-element                   techniques.  The large eddy simulation technique will be used,                  in which the subgrid turbulent motion is modeled approximately                  while the large scale structures  are calculated directly.  A                   single-point probability density function method will be                        developed for the scalar subgrid closure, and a two-equation                    subgrid model will be employed for the hydrodynamic closure.                    In a second program, the effects of compressibility on hyper-                   velocity three-dimensional reacting turbulent flows will be                     investigated using a hybrid finite difference/element                           pseudospectral algorithm.  Several recently developed shock                     capturing schemes will be implemented for high Mach number                      flow simulations.                                                                                                                                               The thorough understanding of turbulent reactive flows is                       essential to operate modern engines and power systems within                    the constraints of high efficiency and low emissions, and the                   next generation of supersonic aircraft poses questions which                    may not be answerable through traditional experimentation and                   development techniques.  This research program will provide                     new tools for engineers to extract answers to many of those                     questions.",
