 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of scientists and science educators at Stanford University will         develop a student text, a set of student activities, and a teacher's            resource book for a two-year course in human biology designed for               seventh and eighth graders.  The course will include a large component          of human physiology as well as topics in anthropology, psychology, and          sociology that are relevant to the maturation of adolescents.  Because          the course focuses on the development of the very age-group that will           study these materials, it should prove to be highly motivational.                                                                                               A team of middle-school science teachers will test early versions of the        materials in class, and will provide feedback and assistance as                 revisions are made.  A series of three two-week summer institutes for           thirty participants per year has been planned to facilitate the                 rewriting process.                                                                                                                                              The development of a college-level version of this human biology course         was supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York; this course is           now offered to several hundred Stanford under-graduates each year.              Carnegie has also provided support for preliminary work on the current          project, and the staff of the Stanford Human Biology Program is                 available to assist in the new task.  In addition, the project will             benefit from the advice of an eminent group of scientists and educators         who have agreed to serve on the project's Advisory Board.                                                                                                       Teachers of this course will be challenged by its scope and by the              sensitivity of some of the topics to be treated.  The project staff will        assist on two levels.  All adopting teachers will be able to acquire a          set of videotapes designed to provide background for the print                  materials.  Teachers who need more help with the fundamental course             content will have an opportunity to participate in a summer institute           that will focus specifically on these materials.                                                                                                                The project time-line calls for three years of materials development,           testing, and revision.  Evaluation will begin before the end of this            period and continue beyond.  Teacher education efforts, in part                 supported by royalty revenue from textbooks sales, will continue for            several additional years.                                                                                                                                       The Innovative Projects Division of the Addison-Wesley Publishing house         will assist in all phases of development process and will publish and           market the finished products.  The company will also share                      responsibility for the teacher education activities.",
