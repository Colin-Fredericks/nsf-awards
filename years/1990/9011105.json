This project will examine the data from the                                     Loma Prieta Earthquake to assess the                                            macroeconomic impact of that earthquake on the                                  Bay Area economy.  Macroeconomic impacts                                        include the economic effects of the earthquake                                  on employment, income, and output of                                            industries in the region.  Some additional                                      work will be conducted, if possible, to                                         estimate the effects on the economies of the                                    State and nation.                                                                                                                                               Data will be obtained from both published and                                   unpublished reports on the economic impacts of                                  the earthquake, unemployment claims and                                         employment statistics.  Additional data on                                      damage to transportation and lifelines,                                         buildings, and building contents will be                                        obtained from public agencies and other                                         sources.                                                                                                                                                        The analysis of these data will use ABAG's                                      input-output model for the San Francisco Bay                                    Area.  Input-output analysis provides a method                                  of desegregating an economy into its                                            constituent sectors, thereby providing a                                        format within which these sectors can be                                        studied in depth and structural                                                 interdependence of the economy can be related                                   to consumption patterns.                                                                                                                                        One key goal of this project will be to                                         identify the major factors affecting the size                                   of the economic losses (and gains) for two                                      reasons:                                                                                                                                                             (1)  to enable future researchers to                                                 better predict the economic                                                     implications of future earthquakes;                                             and                                                                        (2)  to enable better analysis of the                                                costs vs. benefits of earthquake                                                mitigation strategies.",
