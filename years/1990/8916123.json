 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 206Pb/204Pb isotopic compositions of oceanic basalts                   seem to be higher than the bulk Earth values since they plot to                 the right of the geochron.  This is important because it shows                  that the U-Pb systems has behaved differently than the Sm-Nd and                Rb-Sr systems during he evolution of the mantle.  There have been               numerous models proposed that could explain the anomalous Pb                    values of ocean basalts.  One of these models proposes that U                   preferentially concentrates in the upper crust during                           intracrustal differentiation.  Consequently any preferential                    recycling of the upper crust into the mantle would result in a                  mantle more radiogenic than the bulk Earth.  This model requires                U depleted lower continental crust with low U/Pb ratios.  There                 are few data available that can constrain the U/Pb ratio of the                 lower crust and estimates of this value vary widely.  This study                will obtain U-Pb-Th elemental data for exposed granulites from                  the Grenville Province in Ontario, and for lower crustal                        xenoliths from New Mexico and Arizona in order to constrain the                 U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios of the lower crust.  Lead isotopic data                   will also be obtained in order to constrain the timing of U                     depletion.  It is important to analyze exposed granulites and                   xenoliths because they may represent different levels of the                    crust.  These localities were chosen because of extensive                       previous work, which among other things constrain the lithologic                characteristics and P, T of last equilibration of the samples.                  In the Grenville Province, samples are available that                           equilibrated over a ca. 5Kb range.  These data will allow                       evaluation of the behavior of U-Th and Pb with pressure.  The New               Mexico and Arizona localities will allow estimation of U/Pb of                  the present day lower crust in those areas.  The data obtained in               this study will at least double the available U-Th-Pb data                      available for granulites worldwide and will help constrain the                  U/Pb ratio of the lower crust and Pb-isotope models of the                      evolution of the mantle.",
