 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association of Museums will conduct during 1989 and 1990 a         comprehensive survey and data collection program on the status of               American museums, establishing a baseline of data that will allow future        comparisons on a consistent basis.  Nearly every aspect of museums'             organization, finances, and activities will be examined by this survey,         guided by peer advice from each of the museum types, a national Steering        Committee, and by consultants with substantials survey experience.  The         final products will include a public database, a summary report and             accompanying technical reports, and a press release on the findings.                                                                                            The survey will encompass the universe of American museums, including a         wide variety of science and technology related institutions and will            complement the NSF-funded AS-TC science technology center survey of             1987-8.  Independent scholars will be asked to carry out secondary              analyses of the data, and in future years the survey will be updated            with examinations of specific topics for further investigation.  NSF            support will amount to less than 10% of the total cost.",
