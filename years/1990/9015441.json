 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination            Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners             under that competition.                                                         The goal of this project is to develop a conceptual framework and a             prototype system for collaboration in an asynchronous mode among                members of design teams.  The proposed design environments include              knowledge-based and graphic construction components with issue-based            hypermedia systems designed to support collaboration.  The                      application domain for the prototype system is the design of                    communications networks within buildings.  The complexity of such               projects forces large and heterogeneous groups to work together over            long periods of time.  The large and growing discrepancy between in             amount of potentially relevant knowledge for the design task and the            amount any one designer can know and remember puts limits on                    progress in design.  Overcoming this limit is a central challenge               for developers of systems that support both individual and                      collaborative design efforts.  The work in this project builds on               previous developments embodied in the FRAMER system for the design              of human-computer interfaces and the JANUS system for architectural             design.",
