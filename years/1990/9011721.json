 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accurate and precise measurement of polymer melt                       temperatures during processing is generally a problematic                       procedure.  This is especially true for the injection molding                   process where the cyclic and transient nature of the operation                  results in spatial and temporal variations of the polymer melt                  stream temperature.  Current techniques to measure polymer melt                 temperatures in a typical manufacturing operation are either                    ignored, misused, or highly deficient, and there is a great need                to advance the technology of measuring important stream variables               such as the temperature of a polymer melt.  The primary objective               of this study is to develop a reliable methodology for applying                 infrared pyrometers to the measurement of polymer melt temperatures             during the manufacture of plastic articles, whereby such a                      measurement could then be used for either monitoring or control                 purposes.  Several key advantages that infrared pyrometers have                 over conventional thermometry techniques are:  response times on                the order of milliseconds, capacity of in situ real-time                        measurement, and potential for measuring subsurface temperatures                in a non-intrusive fashion.  However, the conversion of infrared                radiation emitted from a polymer melt into more than just                       semi-quantitative information is not a straightforward procedure.               Commercially available instrumentation will be installed on an                  injection molding machine so that the researchers can collect and               analyze data obtained from a series of controlled experiments.  An              immediate benefit from the research will be a correct methodology               for using infrared pyrometers.",
