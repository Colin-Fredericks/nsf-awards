 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SUPER Program has completed its field work and most of the                  ensuing laboratory analyses.  SUPER stands for SUbarctic                        Pacific Ecosystem Research, a program studying the pelagic                      production dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska, sponsored by NSF.                    Six expeditions into the Gulf of Alaska were mounted for a                      large variety of observations.  The goal was to understand the                  absence of phytoplankton blooms in this region, together with                   continuously high concentrations of nutrients like nitrate.                     This investigator represents an accomplishment-based renewal                    (ABR) in order to prepare a full summary in book form of the                    SUPER results.  This also would take account of other past and                  current research on the pelagic ecology of the subarctic                        Pacific.  The SUPER group did arrive at a new, system-level                     view of production dynamics in the subarctic Pacific. This                      system level view will be the basis for developing the summary                  for the SUPER results.",
