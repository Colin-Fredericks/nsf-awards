Cao, working under the direction of Professor                         Schweber, is examining the history of the renormalization                       program in quantum field theory (QFT), covering the period                      form the early 1950's to the beginning of the 1980's--that is,                  from the work of Dyson and Salam that completed the initial                     phase of the renormalization theory to the formulation of the                   notion of effective field theories by Weinberg, Georgi and                      others.  Drs. Cao and Schweber hope to demonstrate that with                    the changing understanding of the physics of renormalization                    came a new conceptualization of quantum field theory, both                      with respect to its global structural pattern and to its                        status as a fundamental or phenomenological framework, thereby                  providing a basis for the proper understanding of the history                   of quantum field theory and of elementary particle physics.                     The emphasis in this research will be on the advances in                        understanding the physics and the philosophy of                                 renormalization in the context of the interplay between                         quantum field theory, S-matrix theory and high energy physics,                  and that of the standard model of electroweak and strong                        interactions.",
