 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diverse populations of low molecular weight RNAs, found in both                 prokaryotic and eukaryotic organsims, have been shown to play                   important roles in a wide variety of cellular processes including               DNA replication, RNA transcription and processing, and mRNA                     translation.  This laboratory's research efforts are focused on the             structure and function of one such small nuclear RNA designated                 snRNA U14.  This evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic lmwRNA species             possesses a conserved ability to intermolecularly base-pair with                18s ribosomal RNA.   Molecular and cellular characterization of                 mouse and Xenopus U14 as well as genetic analysis of yeast U14                  strongly indicate a role in eukaryotic rRNA synthesis and/or                    processing.  Recent experiments have quite surprisingly revealed                the positioning of the mouse and Xenopus U14 genes within intron                5 of the constitutive-expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a                unique genomic organization for an snRNA.                                       The experiments outlined in this investigation will examine the                 synthesis, structure, and function of eukaryotic snRNA U14.  The                biosynthetic pathway responsible for U14 biogenesis defined.  The               synthesis and cellular distribution of U14 will be studied in both              normally and abnormally growing cells.  U14's role in rRNA                      processing as well as possible involvement in the heat shock/stress             response will be examined.  Finally, structural studies will define             an evolutionarily conserved U14 secondary structure, determine                  those U14/18s rRNA sequences involved in intermolecular                         hybridization, and characterize the U14-associated proteins of a                putative U14 ribonucleoprotein complex.  Results from these studies             will lead to a better understanding of the structure/function                   relationships of this unique and evolutionarily important                       eukaryotic lmwRNA.***//",
