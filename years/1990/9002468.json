 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                   geometry of Professor Andrew Wiles of Princeton University. Dr.                 Wiles plans to continue his researches in Iwasawa Theory by                     examining the symmetric square of a representation associated to                a certain class of Hecke eigenforms. In this way, he hopes to                   attack the Greenberg conjectures, which concern the newly defined               Selmer groups of compatible families of L-adic representations.                      This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
