 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main thrust of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic                  and Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis of new                    cluster compounds containing boron linked to such transition                    metals as cobalt and iron. In addition to providing interesting                 new compounds and contributing to an understanding of the                       forces which hold large cluster compounds together, the project                 is expected to provide new routes for the preparation of thin                   films made up of the cores of the boron-transition metal                        clusters.                                                                                                                                                       Following on the isolation and characterization of a discrete                   transition metal boride, the first objective is to define the                   chemistry of six-metal borides and to synthesize related, but                   presently unknown, systems. Metallacycles will be used as                       convenient precursors for metal-carbon cages containing boron                   or aluminum atoms. The facile replacement of the aluminum                       fragment by other fragments, such as BF, will be investigated                   as a route to new cages. A transition metal carbido cluster,                    which has been shown to serve as an exceedingly bulky, strongly                 pi-donating ligand to boron, will be investigated as a means of                 stabilizing unusual bonding modes of orbitally-rich (\"electron                  deficient\") main group atoms. Since clusters can be coupled or                  condnsed in a variety of ways to form larger assemblies, the                    final objective is to demonstrate the usefulness of B-O-B bonds                 as covalent cluster links; of bipolar cluster ligands in                        assembling cluster precursors or clusters themselves; and of                    main group-transition element clusters as precursors to solid                   thin films made up of the cluster cores.",
