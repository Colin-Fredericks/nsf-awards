 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this mathematical research are to apply                       differential geometric tools to the study of problems arising in                geometric function theory.  A common feature of the work is the                 use of conformal metrics, especially the hyperbolic, euclidean                  and spherical metrics.                                                               One of the primary areas of interest will be a reexamination               of the Bloch constant in light of a recent result which provided                the first improvement in the lower bound in fifty years.  While                 the improvement is small, the method is new.  Moreover, a new                   geometric derivation of the improved bound opens up                             the possibility of further improvement as well as applications                  to other extremal problems (some of which have already been                     made).  Extensions of this work to several complex variables also               will be considered.                                                                  A second line of investigation involves the derivation                     of analytic expressions which are necessary and sufficient for                  a given function to be univalent on a domain.  These are given in               terms of two-point distortion theorems, of which there are many.                Two particular goals in the work concern conditions which imply                 univalence in domains which are not simply connected                            and establishing whether an expression can be found which, when                 satisfied by all univalent functions, gives information about the               connectivity of the underlying domain.                                               Work on circle packing as a means for approximating                        conformal mappings will continue.  This relatively new point of                 view was introduced five years ago by W. Thurston and has led to                several new lines of investigation in function theory.  In                      this project, work will be done expanding on recent successes in                the approximation of conformal maps of finitely connected                       domains to the case of mappings on Riemann surfaces.                            Equivalently,  attention will focus on the use of circle packings               to approximate the covering map of a disk onto a region of finite               connectivity.",
