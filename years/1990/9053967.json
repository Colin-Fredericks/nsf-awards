 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer provides handicapped people in this modern society a               tool which can greatly enhance their chances of independent living              in many ways.  It permits them to live more normal lives.  This                 program proposes to utilize special education majors by teaming                 them with handicapped students.  The special education majors                   involved will receive instruction related to the specific hardware              and software required by their teammates.  They, in turn, will have             the responsibility of teaching these computer related skills to                 their partners.                                                                                                                                                 This program will provide all students involved with the basis for              further studies in the area of computing; the special education                 students will be provided with important exposure to tools of their             trade not normally received in an undergraduate program and the                 handicapped with knowledge that will make them more marketable.
