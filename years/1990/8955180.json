 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virgin Island Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics and                        Science (VITEMS) project is a cooperative effort between                        the Virgin Islands Department of Education and the                              University of the Virgin Islands.  It will, over a period                       of three years, improve science and mathematics education                       in eighteen public elementary schools in the US Virgin                          Islands through training and integrated follow-up                               support.                                                                                                                                                        For each of three years, a five-week summer workshop                            which starts out with a week-long retreat in a mangrove                         forest will bring together forty K-6 teachers and                               principals selected as a team from each of six schools.                         During the three year time period, eighteen schools and                         one hundred and twenty teachers will participate.  This                         should give excellent coverage of the elementary                                educators on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. The                       science content and activities will be based on                                 nationally produced and successful projects which will                          be adapted for use as applicable to the islands' ecology                        and population.  The mathematics will be based on the                           standards published by the National Council of Teachers                         of Mathematics.  Many consultants of excellent reputation                       will augment the science and mathematics expertise of the                       University.                                                                                                                                                     The materials used during the workshops will be piloted                         in the classes and in Saturday Academies under the                              formative observation of the VITEMS staff.  Thus,                               students as well as teachers will begin to benefit from                         this project immediately. The participants will also                            receive training in the use of electronic mail so that                          VITEMS can provide a science/math consulting service, can                       monitor the science and math instruction and can provide                        a networking mechanism for the teachers.  The Department                        of Education is providing all the funds for this                                electronic network including cost of modems and telephone                       time.                                                                                                                                                           An amount equivalent to over 50% of the NSF request is                          being cost-shared by the VI Department of Education and                         the University of the Virgin Islands.",
