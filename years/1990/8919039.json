 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten colleges of the Minnesota Private College Council request                 support in the form of telecommunications equipment and leased                  lines in order to connect their campus networks to the Minnesota                Regional Network (MRNet).  The institutions involved - Augsburg                 College, Bethel College, Concordia College, Gustavus Adolphus                   College, Hamline University, Macalester College, College of St.                 Catherine, College of St. Mary, College of St Scholatica, and the               College of St. Thomas - will develop a consistent system-wide                   architecture for national network access and will provide a                     structure for general access to the Internet.  Additionally, a                  higher quality communications system will be fostered by                        providing network-wide management and information services                      through MRNet and the Minnesota Supercomputing Center.                                                                                                          The proposed connections will provide reliable, relatively high-                speed, and flexible access to functions such as file transfer,                  remote login, and teleconferencing.  The links will enhance the                 research and personal-productivity capabilities of faculty and                  students and will make available significant, additional                        resources to supplement course work.  It will also facilitate                   access to national networks and their services, including                       supercomputing resources and large database access.",
