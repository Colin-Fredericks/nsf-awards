 "awd_abstract_narration": "There exists a need for large scale liposome manufacturing                      processes which can meet the growing market demand for                          liposomal drug delivery and controlled release vehicles                         within constraints of stability, sterility and cost.  They                      propose to develop an improved large scale liposome                             manufacturing process.  They propose to do so by replacing                      the organic solvents used in the preparation of liposomes                       with near critical or supercritical fluid (SCF) solvents.                       They also plan to evaluate the use of SCFs as a                                 replacement for liposome manufacturing by high pressure                         homogenization.                                                                                                                                                 The displacement of organic solvents with supercritical                         fluid solvents in the liposomal manufacturing process will                      reduce the degradation of the phospholipids and                                 encapsulated therapeutics and allow rapid solvent                               separation, recovery and reuse.  There are several                              potential benefits to the proposed processes over existing                      laboratory and commercial processes for the preparation of                      liposomes.  The anticipated benefits are:  non-use of                           organic solvents; terminal sterilization of the                                 manufactured liposomes; an oxygen free atmosphere;                              replacement of significant heating effects with cooling                         ones; lower pressure requirements when compared to high                         pressure homogenization; lower O&M costs; higher speed of                       processing; the potential formation of uniform FATMLVs;                         the ability to operate continuously; and scalability.",
