 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this research is to advance the theory of              nonlinear 0-1 programming, to design efficient algorithms for the               main type of such problems arising in engineering and to make largely           available the corresponding codes.  Further investigations will be              undertaken towards the improvement of exact and heuristic solution              methods for unconstrained, constrained and hyperbolic nonlinear 0-1             programs, and their application to reasoning under uncertainty in               expert systems (probabilistic logic) and to machine load balancing              problems in flexible manufacturing.                                               Interactive activities include teaching preceptorial courses on Case          Studies in Operations Research and on Integer Programming and giving            guest lectures.  Additionally, Dr. Jaumard will lead seminars on                recent research problems.                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
