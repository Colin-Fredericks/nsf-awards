 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of regenerating tissue in a larval insect inhibits                 the endocrine system from initiating molting or metamorphosis                   until the regeneration is complete, but the nature of the                       inhibitory signal is unknown. A similar effect of growing                       peripheral tissues on the endocrine system is thought to be                     responsible for the dramatically prolonged larval life which is                 associated with continuously growing imaginal discs in lethal                   imaginal-disc overgrowth mutants of Drosophila. Dr. Bryant                      proposes to test the latter idea by investigating the                           endocrinology of these mutants. He will complete his measurements               of ecdysteroid titers in mutant larvae and on wild type larvae                  containing regenerating imaginal disc, and he will determine                    whether there are changes in the ratio between C-27 and C-28                    ecdysteroids. Using in vitro culture of imaginal discs and ring                 glands, he will investigate whether the reduced ecdysteroid titer               that he has documented in the mutants is due to increased                       utilization or degradation of ecdysteroids by the imaginal discs                or to inhibition of ecdysteroid release by the ring gland. The                  preliminary results already show a reduction of ring gland output               in tow of the mutants. Dr. Bryant will investigate whether such                 effects are ring gland autonomous or are indirect effects due to                the presence of growing imaginal discs. The effect on the                       endocrine system will be investigated by measuring the production               of prothoracicotropic hormone by mutant nervous systems.                        %%%                                                                             This study will provide new evidence on an important but little                 understood link in the chain of events that control developmental               timing in insects.",
