 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project assembles new data and provides significant new                     results on some of the most timely and important issues in U.S.                 tax policy.  The first part determines how transaction taxes and                other costs of trading affect stock market performance.  The                    second part uses the \"natural experiment\" provided by the U.S.                  time series data, particularly the 1981 and 1986 tax reforms, as                well as comparisons between U.S. and Canadian experience, to test               competing theories of how tax subsidies affect the markets for                  rental and owner-occupied housing.                                                                                                                              The questions about transaction costs and stock market                          performance attracted substantial policy interest in the                        aftermath of the October 1987 market break.  Plans to grant                     capital gains tax relief for long-run investments, as well as                   suggestions to tax all securities transactions regardless of gain               or loss, are examples of such fiscal initiatives.  Unfortunately,               there is virtually no empirical basis for evaluating these                      proposals.  This part of the project develops a data set                        consisting of time series on the transactions taxes and                         commission rates for each of the major stock exchanges in world                 equity markets; uses these data and other information on market                 characteristics to study the links between trading costs and                    equity turnover rates, market volatility, the size of the market                decline in October 1987, and serial correlation properties of                   stock returns; and conducts an in-depth study of several nations                which have changed their transaction tax rates or their                         commission structures during the last decade.                                                                                                                   The influence of taxation on housing markets is also essential to               evaluating recent tax changes.  For example, the 1986 Tax Reform                Act may ultimately increase real rents by twenty percent.  For                  most low-income households, the welfare effects of this change in               the real cost of an item which may account for 35% of the                       household budget is far larger than the direct effects of changes               in tax payments.  This project uses time series data from the                   United States and Canada (a \"control\" with similar demographic                  and financial conditions but divergent tax policies) to study                   the housing effects of tax reform.  There has been relatively                   little empirical work using the variation in U.S. tax policies in               the last five years to determine which models or assumptions best               described the observed effects.",
