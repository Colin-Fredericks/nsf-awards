 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Joseph Scott and Sharon Broadwater of the College of                  William and Mary are studying the details of cell division in                   groups of red algae (Rhodophyta) using scanning and transmisson                 electron microscopy.  The number, kinds, and orientations of                    subcellular structures combine to create patterns of cell                       division that appear to be characteristic for major groups of red               algae at the ordinal or subclass taxonomic level.  Research is                  continuing on cell division patterns in groups of Corallinales                  and Batrachospermales, which at present are poorly known.                            The investigators are also conducting a search in red algae                for the recently described protein centrin, which is a                          contractile protein thought to be present in all eukaryotic cells               and involved in chromosome movement.  In addition, the enigmatic                unicellular organism Glaucosphaera vacuolata is being studied                   through electron microscopy and molecular and immunocytochemical                methods.  One of the unique characters of Rhodophyta, alone among               the world's algae, is the lack of a flagellar apparatus, yet Drs.               Scott and Broadwater have preliminary data indicating that G.                   vacuolata possesses a non-emergent flagellum located within a                   red-algal cytoplasm.  Molecular and immunocytochemical tests are                being made with the help of collaborators, to confirm the                       presence of centrin and of a reduced flagellum.  The results will               provide new insights into phylogenetic relationships within the                 red algae and with other groups of primitive organisms.",
