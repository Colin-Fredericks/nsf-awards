The objective of this project is to document                                    the damage to lifelines, such as pipeline                                       leaks and breaks, that occurred during this                                     earthquake, and to develop a permanent record                                   of this damage for use by researchers.  This                                    data base of pipeline damage is of value to                                     the geotechnical engineering community and to                                   researchers in seismic risk and lifeline                                        engineering.
