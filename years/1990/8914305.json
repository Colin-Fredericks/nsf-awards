 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of transition metal                            organometallic chemistry. The focus of the project is compounds                 in which the organic molecule pentadiene is coupled with the                    so-called transition metals, such as titanium, vanadium and                     chromium. Such compounds are similar to the the compounds of                    cyclopentadiene which are used extensively as industrial                        catalysts, and the substitution of pentadiene for                               cyclopentadiene brings about substantial enhancements of                        thermal stability and chemical reactivity. Potential                            applications of the pentadienyl compounds include the                           deposition of metal films and the catalysis of polymerization                   reactions.                                                                                                                                                      The preparation of new open metallocenes, i.e.,                                 bis(pentadienyl)metal compounds, will be attempted for                          manganese and for second and third row transition metals,                       following up on the preparation of such a compound of                           zirconium, for which no bis(cyclopentadienyl) compound is                       known. The structures of the new compounds will be determined,                  and their reaction chemistry will be explored. The utilization                  of highly-substituted pentadienyl ligands will be explored,                     especially ligands with silyl and siloxy substituents.                          Bimetallic compounds containing  \"open fulvalene\" ligands will                  be prepared so that metal-metal communciation via the linked                    pentadienyl ligands may be explored. Potential applications of                  pentadienyl coupling reactions will be explored, involving such                 reagents as nitriles, isonitriles, alkynes, imines, and acyl                    groups. Some of the latter reactions are expected to involve                    useful ring-forming reactions, leading in some cases to                         bicyclic organic molecules.",
