The proposed research will compare risk                  attitudes and perceptions in the United States and Japan.  Although             both the United States and Japan are highly industrialized                      countries, their approaches to managing technological risks are                 quite different.  The United States relies primarily on a                       \"confrontational model\" characterized by adversarial relationships              between interested parties, widespread public participation, and                extensive use of the legal system.  The Japanese approach, in                   comparison, is based on a \"cooperative model\" centered upon private             negotiations between government and industry with an emphasis on                consensus building.  The proposal hypothesizes that these                       contrasting approaches are reflected in major differences in public             attitudes and perceptions of risk in general and risk management                in particular.                                                                  This project will examine these differences by carrying out                     parallel studies of risk attitudes and risk perceptions in both                 countries.  The research will be conducted in cooperation with                  colleagues in Japan.  The investigators will draw upon their                    extensive prior experience in analyzing the components of risk in               various populations.  Besides providing information that will be                relevant to the future interactions between the two countries, this             comparison will increase basic understanding of national risk-                  management styles and approaches.",
