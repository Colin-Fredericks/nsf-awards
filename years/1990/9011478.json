 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a fast hardware for multi-         variable fuzzy control systems using Logic Cell Arrays (LRAs), user             programmable gate arrays.  These Logic Cell Arrays combine the logic            integration benefits of custom VSLI with the advantages of using                standard Integrated Circuits.  In this work, the multi-variable fuzzy           control system is reduced to Boonlean expression that can be stored in          the Logic Cell Array.  Using the on-chip memory, the Logic Cell Array           is configured so as to store the Boonlean expressions.  Therefore, the          fuzzy logic inferences per second (FLIPS) of the system are determined          by the response time of the Logic Cell Array.                                                                                                                   In most of the current applications of fuzzy controllers, software is           employed as a medium for the implementation of fuzzy control rules.  The        hardware approach pursued in this research gives a cheaper and more             effective implementation.  Furthermore, it expands the actual use of            fuzzy controller in many application areas where speed is critical such         as robot control and speech recognition, among others.",
