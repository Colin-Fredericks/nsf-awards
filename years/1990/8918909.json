The meeting, sponsored by the                    Caribbean Mathematics Foundation (CMF), will be jointly organized               by Prof. Jorge Martinez of the  University of Florida and Prof.                 Waldemar Marcha of the University of the Netherlands Antilles.                  The purpose of the meeting is for mathematicians from the Caribbean             and Latin America to meet experts from the U.S., Europe, and                    Australia to form contacts for future research.  The meeting will               be structured to promote the kinds of contacts that will lessen                 the isolation of developing country mathematicians from mainstream              research.                                                                                                                                                       The conference will be preceded by a one-week mini-course given by              three world class researchers who will furnish an introduction to               the theory of positive operators on ordered Banach spaces.                      Funding from this award will help to provide stipends for 16                    participants to attend this mini-course.  The CMF is encouraging                as many of the mini-course participants to stay the second week                 for the conference, which will bring together some of the world's               leading experts from the structure theory of ordered Banach                     spaces, the semigroup theory of positive operators, and their                   application.  By providing an environment where developing country              mathematicians can meet and exchange information with world class               researchers, this award fulfills the objectives of the Science in               Developing Countries Program.",
