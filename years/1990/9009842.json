 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor processing techniques will be utilized                            to fabricate electron optical structures.  In addition to                       electron microscopy the results of this research can                            also be applied to high definition cathode ray tubes                            (HDCRT), 10um period wigglers, and vacuum                                       microelectronics.  The areas considered in this                                 proposal are:                                                                     .   A specimen holder with a binary selection of                                    square apertures in a diaphragm ranging from                                    1um to 32um on a side, to support ultrathin                                     specimens.                                                                  .   Miniature thermionic electron sources that                                      have a flat emitting surface of varying size.                                   There will be up to 10,000 of these filaments                                   on each substrate.  In addition a pseudo-                                       blackbody source of electrons will be                                           fabricated, this will have the advantage of a                                   reduced evaporation of work function                                            lowering impurities for tungsten.                                            .  Programmable thermionic electron sources                                        that can control the emitting surface by                                        changing the current path.  This feature will                                   add flexibility to the traditional triode design                                that relies on a Wehnelt electrode to control                                   the emitting area.                                                        Electron specimen holders, and sources have been                                traditionally made with a beaker or in a machine                                shop.  Semiconductor processing techniques                                      developed for integrated circuit manufacture can                                generate 1-100um patterns in two and three                                      dimensions with appropriate etching.  This                                      unprecedented control can be used to greatly improve                            the ease of manufacture of electron optical                                     components and the resolution in microscopy.",
