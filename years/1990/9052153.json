 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to increase the number of female and                minority inner-city high school students entering higher                        educational engineering programs.  This undertaking is the result               of concern about the low entry rate of women and minority members               into the study of college science and engineering.  Through                     previous outreach work 223 high school freshman and sophomores have             gained awareness of engineering career options and strengthened                 their science and mathematics skills.  This experience has                      indicated that while participants are more knowledgeable and                    enthusiastic about entering engineering, their academic achievement             in the prerequisite science and mathematics falls short in most                 cases.                                                                                                                                                          This project seeks to improve upon this past experience by matching             the teaching methodology more closely to the program population.                Its solution appears to be in providing the inner city teenagers                with an instructional approach that is interactive, visually                    oriented and individualized.  Having succeeded in capturing the                 interest of these students and in making them aware of their                    personal potential, this engineering exploratory computer                       laboratory enables them to attain the academic levels in science                and mathematics necessary to realize their ambitions.                                                                                                           The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
