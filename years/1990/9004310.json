 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two major aspects of germ cell development examined in this                 proposal are: a) oogenesis per se (the transformation of oogonia                into oocytes) and early oocyte development and b) the initiation                of vitellogenesis. Both the pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, and                  the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, will be used because of the                  unique arrangement of developing follicles in their ovaries,                    where a sequential pattern of oocyte development is observed.                   This pattern begins on one side of the ovary and a gradient of                  follicles of increasing developmental age extends to the opposite               side. Little is known about the regulation of early events of                   oocyte formation in embryonic ovaries of most vertebrates and the               absence of very early stage oocytes in adult ovaries in many                    species. The presence of germinal tissue (oogonia and meiotic                   oocytes) in a restricted but easily accessible region of                        syngnathan ovaries makes these teleost ideal for studying early                 germ cell events and their hormonal regulation in an adult                      vertebrate. The extent of oogonial proliferation and the time                   for progression of oocytes through meiosis will be determined in                vivo. Dr. Selman will then attempt to duplicate both processes in               vitro by examining the influence of various hormones and co-                    cultured tissues on oogonial division and the progression of                    oocytes from leptotene up to diplotene stages. The process of                   follicle formation will also be examined. Dr. Selman intends to                 characterize the transition from previtellogenesis to                           vitellogenesis in syngnathans and will address the cellular                     mechanism(s) responsible for the initiation of vitellogenesis.                  For this she will examine follicular vascularization,                           vitellogenin accessibility, the ontogeny of functional                          vitellogenin rectors and the intraoocytic fate of internalized                  vitellogenin. Studies will be performed both in vivo and in vitro               to determine whether a cessation of normal lysosomal synthesis                  and/or activity or a modification of the endocytic pathway                      distinguishes previtellogenic form vitellogenic oocytes.",
