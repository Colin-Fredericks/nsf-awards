 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal offers significant new insights into organizational               learning and the transfer of knowledge within organizations.  Large             increases in productivity have been observed as manufacturing units             gain experience in production.  These learning curves have been                 observed in many organizations.  The proposed research extends the              analysis of learning to quality -- a variable that has become                   increasingly important to a firm's competitiveness.                                                                                                             The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose: (1) to evaluate the                  transfer of learning across shifts in a plant, and (2) to analyze               the link between quality and production experience.  They plan to               investigate the rate at which quality improves with experience,                 whether quality improvements persist over time, and whether such                improvements can be transferred.  The proposed research will                    advance scientific knowledge about learning curves in manufacturing             organizations.  This information should enable firms to improve                 their productivity and the quality of their product, and hence to               compete more effectively.                                                        //",
