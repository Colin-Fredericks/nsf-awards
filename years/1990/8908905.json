Based on an                      extensive program of contemporary (1965-70) fieldwork in 1002                   communities across the U.S., and an equally extensive collection                of historical and written sources, DARE includes words, phrases,                and pronunciations that vary from one part of the country to                    another or from one social group to another.  The Dictionary                    provides full historical treatment, with pronunciations, variant                forms, etymologies, geographical distributions, social and usage                labels, notes definitions, dated quatations, and cross-                         references, as appropriate.  A unique feature of DARE is the                    inclusion (within the text) of maps showing regional                            distributions of words, phrases, or forms.  Volume I, containing                introductory matter and the letters A-C, was published in 1985 to               the acclaim of scholars, reviewers, and the public as well.                     Volume II (D-H) will appear in 1990.  Three more volumes,                       including two more of text and one containing the bibliography,                 contrastive regional and social maps, and summary of all the data               collected during the fieldwork, will complete the project.                      Volumes will appear at approximately five-year intervals.  DARE                 will not only provide a full record of regional American English,               but will alos furnish, both in the Dictionary text and in the                   unused data, the resources to stimulate much further linguistic                 research.",
