 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports U.S. participation in a                     U.S.-Indo workshop on manufacturing systems, scheduled to                       be held in April 1990 in New Delhi, India. The Indian                           co-organizer is Dr. Rakesh Sagar of the Mechanical                              Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of                               Technology in New Delhi.  The topics to be covered include:                     computer-aided design, kinematics, dynamics, simulation,                        computer graphics, off-line programming, interaction                            between robotics, control, vision, machine intelligence,                        parametric programming, variational geometry, artificial                        intelligence, expert systems, robotics' design, control,                        maintenance and sensory devices.  Other topics related to                       the operation of the factory of the future would also be                        included.  It is expected that the workshop will result in                      identifying the appropriate areas where research is needed,                     the facilities available for that research in the U.S. and                      in India, and possible cooperative research projects                            between Indian and U.S. institutions.                                                                                                                           Scope: The area of manufacturing systems is extremely                           important to the U.S. for improving its competitivness.  It                     is also important to countries like India who need to build                     efficient factories as they add to their growing industrial                     base.  There is significant interest in the scientific                          communities of both countries to develop this                                   multidisciplinary area.  The rapid growth in the                                availability of important tools including inexpensive                           computers and sophisticated and dedicated software makes                        that development more exciting and challenging.  Both                           countries stand to gain from bringing their talents and                         expertise to advance this scientific field.",
