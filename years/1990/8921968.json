 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with polymer colloids and conducting                        polymers in solution.  Studies on the block copoly(oxy-                         ethylene/oxypropylene/oxyethylene) will be carried out in the                   more difficult experimental range where multiple scattering could               become a serious problem.  The idea is to use very thin (0.1-0.5                mm) light-scattering cells and longer wavelength (ca. 0.8                       micron), as well as small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) by means                of a Bonse-Hart apparatus and possibly with the aid of                          synchrotron radiation.  The purposes of the polymer colloid                     studies are several-fold, including methodology for                             characterization of micro-emulsions or micelles with specific                   interacting groups.  For conducting polymers, the interesting                   phenomenon of charged rod aggregation in dilute solution is to be               studied.  Electrophoretic separation coupled with kinetic studies               on the color change and the aggregation process may lead toward a               better understanding on how color change and aggregation are                    related.",
