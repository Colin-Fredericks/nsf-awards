 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will continue investigations into  the                nature of orthogonal polynomials defined on subsets of the real                 and complex numbers.  The orthogonality is defined with regard to               some measure (density) and, depending on the nature of that                     measure, one encounters radically different sets of polynomials.                The polynomials may arise in different contexts - as solutions of               differential equations or as the result of recurrence relations.                But the measure always exists in the background.                                     Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding                        polynomials orthogonal to measures supported on several disjoint                intervals. Asymptotic formulas for polynomials have been                        developed in terms of integral representations when measures are                supported on a single interval.  Efforts will be made to carry                  over this work to the case of support on several                                intervals.Another line of investigation will consider polynomials               orthogonal with respect to measures supported on Julia sets in                  the complex plane.  Two goals are set forth.  The first is to                   show that in general the Jacobi matrix with these polynomials is                limitperiodic when the Julia set is a Cantor set.  A second goal                is to determine the moments of the orthogonality measure via the                recurrence formulas.                                                                 A new line of investigation uses ergodic theory to study                   properties of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.  When                  the recurrence relation is generated by a stochastic process,                   there is a Lyaponov exponent.  When the exponent is zero, there                 is evidence that the measure has an absolutely continuous part.                 Efforts will be made to verify this.",
