 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated approach towards the synthesis of high-bandwidth, low-            latency interconnection networks is pursued that focuses on the                 interdependence of system architecture, VLSI characteristics and                packaging technology.  New designs of one-sided crosspoint switching            modules that can provide several paths between communicating ports in           multichip switches are being studied.  An architecture solution is posed        for the simultaneous switching noise problem and that has been                  traditionally tackled at the circuit design and packing levels.  Novel          schemes for fast arbitration and scheduling through the use of parallel         bus-controllers are analyzed under a variety of message traffic                 conditions.  An alternative approach uses artificial neural networks for        contention resolution.  Trade-offs between switch cost, performance and         reliability are studies under these workloads for various chip sizes.           Topological testing techniques are used for drastic reduction of test           time.  The research findings are being incorporated into a set of               software tools recently developed at UT Austin for the computer-aided           design of networks.                                                                                                                                             Recent technological advances have prompted a resurgence of interest in         cross bar-based designs in the industry, despite the requirement of O           (N2) switches.  Indeed, by considering current VLSI and packaging               technology, it can be shown that power dissipation, current driving             abilities and pinout limitations easily outweigh circuit density demands        of switching networks.  This research aims to lay the foundations for           the cost-effective design of 128-1024 port crossbars with a sustained           bandwidth of 1 GBytes per channel, that can form the core of the next           generation of massively parallel machines and switching networks.",
