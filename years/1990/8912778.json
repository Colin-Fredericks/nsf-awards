 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to investigate the application of proof-theoretic             techniques to problems in the operational semantics of true (non-               interleaving) concurrency.  The research will explore a fruitful                relationship between Petri nets and linear logic theories which gives           rise to a correspondence between net token games and linear proof               trees.  This correspondence makes it possible to see that algorithms            and theorems from the proof theory of linear logic can be applied to            problems in net theory and, conversely, that results about nets have            consequences for provability in fragments of linear logic.  For                 example, standard proof-theoretic concepts such as cut elimination give         rise to algorithms for increasing the concurrency in an execution               sequence on a net.  On the other hand, the decidability of forward              markings on nets can be used to show decidability for a significant             collection of linear logic formulas.  Concepts such as the                      interpretation of logical theories and conservative extension may be            useful in understanding abstraction for nets.  Moreover, it is hoped            that this idea for understanding concurrency in proof trees will lead           to the discovery of other interesting models of concurrency.",
