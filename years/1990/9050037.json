 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests a supplementary grant to conduct                     follow-up work which would expand the findings of an NSF                        project currently being conducted by the principal                              investigator. The purpose of the project is to examine an                       important transition phase in the careers of future women                       scientists and engineers--the immediate postdoctoral period,                    during which a serious differential in participation in S&E                     occurs. The study includes the entire population of women                       whom received postdoctoral fellowships from NSF and NRC.                        Quantitative and qualitative data, obtained through standard                    survey and analysis methods, are used to provide a fuller                       description of the existing barriers, and to formulate and                      test hypotheses that can help guide policy for the reduction                    of these barriers. The purpose of the supplementary grant                       request is to conduct indepth, face-to-face interviews and                      administer a follow-up questionnaire, as important parts of                     the total project.",
