 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stanley Gill is continuing his energetics of chemical                 reaction studies in the Experimental Physical Chemistry                         program.  Professor Gill, of the University of Colorado, has                    been very innovative using advanced electronics and very small                  vessels in which to perform his experiments.                                                                                                                    The project is aimed at enlarging our knowledge about the                       fundamental energetic properties of hydrophobic molecules                       dissolved in water at elevated temperatures.  The hydration of                  such molecules from the gaseous state is being studied in                       Professor Gill's laboratory by a new approach.  This consists                   of perturbing a two phase system (aqueous and non-aqueous) by                   injecting pure water into the aqueous phase and measuring the                   heat evolved from the microcalorimeter which monitors this                      process.",
