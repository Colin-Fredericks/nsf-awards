 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two gas chromatographs systems are to be purchased, one with                    conventional detectors for the polar and nonpolar                               noncondensibles, and the second with mass specific detection                    (GC/MS) for the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).  The                   supporting research emphasizes heterogeneous hydrocarbon                        processing at high temperatures, especially pollutant                           formation during heterogeneous combustion.  Catalytic exhaust                   reduction, NOx formation during coal combustion, and diamond                    film CVD are the topical areas.  The catalytic converter                        program aims to generate the first reliable set  of scalar                      fields under carefully controlled conditions, and use them to                   test the present widely held beliefs concerning rate laws and                   model parameters.  The refinery gas analyzer will be used to                    measure the polar and nonpolar noncondensible fuel and product                  species, to determine transverse profiles of the reaction                       species at selected axial positions in a metal monolith                         converter channel.  The GC/MS system will be used for PAH                       species in the exhaust, especially those from alternative fuel                  formulations.  In relation to NOx formation during coal                         combustion, most of the fuel-N escapes the coal bound into tar                  with the result that substantial fractions of the volatilized                   fuel-N can be reintegrated into a carbonaceous solid phase.                     It is conceivable that the efficiency of NOx abatement under                    fuel rich conditions is due to the promotion of soot                            formation, rather than the direct formation of nitrogen from                    small molecular products such as HCN or ammonia.  The final                     project is directed at diamond deposition from plasma-                          processed hydrocarbon gases, and from the post-flame gases of                   an oxyacetylene torch.  It is suspected that the gas phase                      chemistry when methane is abundant yields significant amounts                   of PAH, and that the PAH is necessary for the formation of an                   amorphous carbon interlayer.  The chromatographs will be used                   to analyze the noncondensibles and PAH in the effluent, to                      clarify the connections between the interlayer and the rate of                  diamond deposition.                                                                                                                                             The two gas chromatographs to be purchased are essential for                    experimentation in combustion, pollution sciences, and high                     temperature materials processing.  Together with the existing                   capability for very heavy hydrocarbon liquids analysis using                    high performance liquid chromatography, the new systems will                    enable determination of virtually all stable species                            associated withthe three research areas described.",
