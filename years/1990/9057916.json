 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramics are widely used in precision electronics and                      biological applications such as sensors, bio-implants, and                      magnetic heads, and have potential for use in mechanical                        components such as engines and bearings.  In view of the high                   accuracy required, ceramic surfaces for these applications are                  generated primarily by slicing, grinding and fine finishing                     processes such as lapping and polishing.  The processes alter the               near-surface mechanical and electromagnetic properties of the                   ceramic causing their performance in systems to deteriorate.                    Therefore, a critical need exists to understand these effects and               to be able to control them through suitable finishing/post-                     finishing processes.  The goal of this research is to understand                the science and technology of ceramic finishing to generate                     atomically smooth surfaces of high quality.                                          The research will use well developed surface                               characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction, electron                 and tunnelling microscopy to characterize the near-surface                      deformation in finished ceramic surfaces.  It will quantify                     deformation induced changes in the near-surface electromagnetic                 and mechanical properties.  A series of studies will be carried                 out to understand the material removal mechanism during fine-                   finishing and its influence on the near-surface properties.  By                 integrating the process-property understanding developed above,                 fine-finishing processes will be developed for generating ceramic               surfaces with controlled surface quality.",
