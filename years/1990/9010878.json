 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores parallel architectures that unify classical AI           and parallel distributed processing.  Parallel architectures for                classical AI (symbolic processing) are based on abstract machines for           the    -calculus or first order logic.  They differ greatly from                connectionist (sub-symbolic) architectures which are based on                   abstractions of biological systems, such as Hopfield's model of the             neuron.                                                                                                                                                         Earlier research by the Principal Investigator suggests that a new class        of systolic arrays, Lukasiewicz logic arrays (LLAs), support both               symbolic and sub-symbolic computation.  These preliminary results are           investigated by implementing resolution, back-propagation and adaptive          resonance theory algorithms for neural networks, and the RETE algorithm         for production system on an LLA simulatory and a VLSI LLA.  Operational         four-cell and 32-cell analog VLSI LLAs were fabricated in January 1990,         and will be used to test these algorithms on small data sets.  A more           complex 128-cell analog VLSI LLA is being designed as part of this              research.                                                                                                                                                       The results being sought include an improved understanding of the design        principles of integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic architectures,               characterization of the electrical properties of analog VLSI LLAs,              specification of a computational model for LLAs in general, and new             algorithms for massively parallel processors based on the LLA model of          computation.",
