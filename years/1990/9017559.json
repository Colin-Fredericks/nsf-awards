 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research plans to provide a fundamental                       understanding of the behavior of light secondary attachments and                equipment in large space structures under a variety of microgravity             loading conditions. One main objective is to develop passive and                active vibration control strategy for sensitive on-board equipment.             Responses of light secondary systems and equipment aboard large                 flexible space structures and spacecrafts with or without vibration             control devices will be analyzed. These systems and equipment will              be subjected to acoustics, on-board moving (rotating)                           instrumentation, lift-off, micrometeroid impacts and maneuvering                and deployment loadings. Deterministic and probabilistic                        techniques, as well as, digital simulations will be used in these               analyses. The nature of tuning of secondary systems to space                    structures with passive or active vibration control devices will                be critically examined. Particular attention will be given to                   performance analyses of frictional dampers for passive vibration                control of equipment aboard space structures.",
