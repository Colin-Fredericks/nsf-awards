 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity is a modern discipline which analyzes the              inherent difficulty of a given task.  A great deal of progress has              been made in classifying the time and space requirements of certain             combinatorial problems.  The complexity classes L, NL, P, NP -                  logarithmic space, nondeterministic logarithmic space, polynomial               time, nondeterministic polynomial time, respectively - have been                studied extensively.  Still little is known about the comparative               strengths of different resources - it is yet to be proved that the              above classes are not all identical.                                                                                                                            Previously these classes have been studied from a mathematical                  viewpoint.  The inherent difficulty of expressing conditions has                been studied and a robust alternate view of complexity ensues.  The             computational complexity of a property is closely tied to the                   complexity of expressing the property in first-order logic.  A series           of languages which express exactly those properties checkable in a              series of computational complexity classes has been introduced.  The            existence of such natural languages for each important complexity               class sheds a new light on complexity theory.  These languages                  reaffirm the importance of the complexity classes as much more than             machine dependent issues.                                                                                                                                       Quite recently this approach has lead to a proof that the class NL is           closed under complementation.  A corollary of this surprising result            is that the class of context-sensitive languages is closed under                comlementation, thus settling a long standing open question in                  complexity theory.                                                                                                                                              This project continues this line of research on complexity theory.              The main thrust is the investigation of parallel time/processor                 trade-offs via the equivalent parameters from descriptive complexity.           Furthermore, the scope of the research will be broadened to include             the modelling of real-time and database computing.",
