 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modulation and coding for the \"recording channel\" has much                 in common with the techniques for the data transmission channel,                but there are also some striking dissimilarities. One of these is               that for the magnetic recording channel there is a \"saturation                  type\" nonlinearity which essentially constrains the channel                     signal to be two-level. The information and communication                       theoretic aspects of recording is a relatively new field and it                 has had some remarkable successes in improving storage efficiency               and reliability. This project addresses several topics in this                  new field, starting with modeling the signal distortion and noise               properties of the recording channel, then studying spectral                     density and other statistical properties of combined                            modulation/coding formats which incorporate run-length and other                constraints imposed by the nature of the recording channel. Other               topics include error-control coding and efficient                               detection/decoding techniques.",
