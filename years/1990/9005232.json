 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is study of magmatic processes occurring at crust and                      mantle levels in volcanic arcs using 238U and 232Th decay series                systematics.  Part of the funding will be used to complete                      ongoing projects that focus on the processes and lengths of time                required to generate and accumulate rhyolite in Cascade arc                     volcanoes.  The volcanoes that are being studied (medicine Lake                 and Crater Lake) have erupted silicic magmas in the Holocene, and               are well-known geologically and geochemically through the work of               U.S.G.S. collaborators.  Approximately 6-9 months will be                       necessary to complete the analyses of whole rocks and contained                 mineral phases for nuclide activities, to determine magma                       residence times with open-system modeling techniques, and to                    write up the results.  The remainder of the 2-year study period                 will be used to investigate the origin of mafic magmas that are                 the geochemical and thermal parents of Central American arc magma               systems.  We will analyze 20-25 rocks from the Central American                 arc and sediments from the Cocos Plate for 238U-230Th-226Ra-232Th               activities.  These same rocks are being analyzed by other                       scientists for 10Be/Be ratios, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios,                  and B, trace element, and major element concentrations.  The goal               is to delineate the nature of the subducting slab component in                  Central American arc magmas, the way it becomes involved in arc                 magma genesis, and the time scales required for magma generation                and transport.",
