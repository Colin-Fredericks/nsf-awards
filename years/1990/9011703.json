 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence suggests that fecundity in women begins to                 decline 15 or more years before the average age of menopause, but               the physiological mechanisms of this process are poorly                         understood.  Ovarian function is an important proximate                         determinant of fecundity, and can be assessed through salivary                  measurement of circulating ovarian steroids.  The research                      proposed will examine the relationship between age and ovarian                  function by determining, for three groups of regularly-cycling                  women, ages 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49, (1) episodic patterns of                   luteal progesterone release in saliva and (2) patterns and levels               of salivary estradiol across the menstrual cycle.  Comparisons                  will be made across groups and with previously-determined                       profiles of younger women (under 35 years of age).                                   This study will seek to identify specific aspects of ovarian               function which may be altered in women of late-reproductive age,                and thus which may contribute to impairment of fecundity.  The                  results of this research will contribute to understanding of this               process in our own population.  They will also help to provide                  additional bases for study of the age structure of fecundity in                 other populations of anthropological interest, and for                          consideration of the historical development of human menopause.",
