 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to obtain the flame thickness response to                     stretch, preferential diffusion, and turbulence.  It proposes                   three specific objectives:  (i) develop an innovative concept                   of using velocity profiles to define and quantify flame                         thicknesses such that they can be meaningfully evaluated with                   ease and accuracy;  (ii) obtain one-dimensional, adiabatic,                     premixed flame thicknesses;  (iii) obtain flame thickness                       response to physico-chemical parameters for comparison with                     theoretical predictions.  Furthermore, the results from this                    proposed program may provide a basis for extending the concept                  to nonpremixed flames.  The velocity profiles and conditional                   velocity statistics will be obtained by using laser doppler                     velocimetry.  A counterflow nozzle configuration will be used                   to stabilize planar, adiabatic flames.                                                                                                                          The results obtained from this proposed experimental study                      will be valuable because (i) they will validate a simple                        method of evaluating the flame thickness which is an intrinsic                  property of flames;  (ii) they will consolidate numerous                        definitions in use presently, thereby promoting unity in its                    description and usage;  and (iii) they will complement and                      test theoretical studies on flame thickness.  Because flame                     thickness has been extensively used in describing behavior of                   flames important in flame stabilization and for interpreting                    turbulent combustion, the proposed study is of fundamental and                  practical importance to combustion science and technology.",
