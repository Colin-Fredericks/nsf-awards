 "awd_abstract_narration": "AZDU, the dimethyl analog of AZT, is slated for clinical                        testing as a therapeutic in the treatment of AIDS.  The                         current production of AZT is by the solution method and what                    small amounts have been made of AZDU have also been made via                    the solution method.  Isolation and purification of the                         product is expensive, labor-intensive and results in                            substantial losses.  Maximum yield that can be realized is                      around 40%.                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this research is to develop an alternative,                    more efficient process for the production of AZDU.  It is                       based on the basic principle that product isolation from a                      reaction mixture is trivial if the product is attached to an                    insoluble polymer.  Isolation then involves nothing more than                   a simple filtration of the resin.  During Phase I of this                       Small Business Innovation Research project the possibility of                   making AZDU on a resin support will be explored.  Specifically                  the PI will attempt to (1) select a suitably functionalized                     polymer to act as insoluble support in the conversion of                        deoxyuridine to AZDU, (2) effect the synthesis of AZDU on                       several samples of polymer in at least respectable yield, (3)                   learn enough about the kinetics of the individual steps to                      plan  optimization for the future work of Phase II, and (4)                     generate a base set of quantitative data for a preliminary                      economic analysis, i.e. materials use, yield, polymer recycle,                  etc.",
