 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most knowledge of parent-offspring relations in mammals is                 based upon studies of mother-infant interactions.  Recently,                    there has become a new awareness of the importance of the                       mammalian father in the care and development of his offspring.                  Indeed, paternal behavior does occur in a minority, but                         significant number, of mammals primarily among rodents,                         carnivores, primates and humans.  However, our knowledge on on                  paternal care is based largely from descriptive studies.  Thus,                 very little is known about the basic mechanisms underlying this                 behavior.  Dr. Gubernick has selected a species in which their                  biparental care system is well documented.  The males actively                  participate in rearing young and display all the components of                  parental behavior exhibited by mothers, and to the same extent,                 except nursing.  Dr. Gubernick will determine the hormonal                      mechanisms and sensory controls underlying the prepartum onset                  and postpartum maintenance of his behavior.  This work provides a               model for the investigation of family systems and of mechanisms                 of paternal behavior that operate in other species, such as                     humans, that might otherwise be undetected.  The findings will be               of considerable theoretical importance for the formation of                     general principles of paternal investment and the evolution of                  parent-offspring relations.",
