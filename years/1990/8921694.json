 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal is concerned with the design, realization, and           characterization of 100 nm and 150 nm gate-length modulation doped              field-effect transistors (MODFET's) based on lattice mateched                   A1InAs/InGaAs heterostructure on InP substrate, and intended for low-           noise and high-gain signal amplification above 100GHz.  The research            efforts at Penn State will involve device structural design and                 Electrical characterization of the completed test device.  The task of          device fabrication will be undertaken by G.E. electronics Laboratory,           Syracuse, NY, and the test samples will be made available to the PI             for studies at no additional cost to NSF.                                                                                                                       The research will examine the electronic transport properties of the            lattice matched and pseudomorphic InGaAs, and the Schottky barrier and          buffer layer isolation quality of the A1InAs heterostructure layers in          the MODFET structure.  The characterization efforts will be organized           in four different task areas involving d.c., small-signal, noise, and           s-parameter measurements.  These task areas will examine the key                issues of device I-V and thermal stability, leakage current,                    breakdownvoltage, carrier concentration and mobility, parasitic                 equivalent network elements, low frequency 1/f type and g-r noise               sources, HF intrinsic device noise sources, and extraction of the               fundamental transit delay and charging time constant associated with            the velocity saturated carrier transport in MODFET's.  The proposed             device structure is expected to provide low-noise (1dB) and high gain           (8dB) amplification at 100 GHz satisfying the future DoD and NSA                communication and radar system requirements.",
