The project includes elements of teacher enhancement,                 curriculum development, teachers as researchers, and research on                teacher development. Over the course of the project teachers will               collaborate closely amongst themselves, and with experts in                     mathematics education, to design, test, refine, and disseminate                 instructional materials in the areas of geometry, problem solving,              estimation, measurement, and statistics. Pedagogical emphasis will be           on the use of small groups and activity-based approaches. Enhancement           activities will occur both at the University of Missouri, and in                site-based meetings of the staff with the teacher participants.                                                                                                 Cost sharing from schools, the university, and individual                       contributions amounts to 20% of the NSF award.",
