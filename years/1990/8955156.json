 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a model program of collaboration                    between The University of Michigan and regional public                          schools designed to train secondary science teachers in the                     development and use of computer-based strategies that are                       aimed at improving overall student biology performance as                       well as eliminating the achievement gap exhibited by                            underrepresented minorities.  While it is understood that                       computer technology is not the sole remedy for our current                      problems in science education, it is known that the                             educational use of computer technology can make a significant                   difference in student performance, and that this potential                      has barely begun to be tapped by U.S. schools.  The                             approaches to be employed in this project are based upon the                    results of a five-year study of educational computing and                       student performance carried out by the principal investigator                   at The University of Michigan.  This study, which was                           initially motivated by the underperformance of Black and                        Hispanic students in introductory biology, led to the                           development of flexibly-paced computer exercises that use                       diagnostic feedback to inform the learner about the reasoning                   underlying both correct and incorrect responses.  Use of this                   new software led to a dramatic improvement in overall class                     performances, as well as elimination of the performance gap                     previously seen with minority students.  By training public                     school teachers in the development and implementation of such                   strategies, the project is thus intended to increase the                        computer skills and subject matter expertise of secondary                       science teachers while simultaneously producing instructional                   materials of proven ability to enhance student performance.                                                                                                     An amount equivalent to 143.2% of the NSF award is being                        contributed as cost-sharing.",
