 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Vom Saal will use two research strategies to examine the hypothesis         that the levels of sex steroids to which male mice (Mus musculus                domesticus) are exposed during fetal life play a major role in                  influencing aging, particularly of the reproductive system.  The first          approach involves using a naturally-occurring phenomenon, the                   intrauterine position phenomenon.  Males occupying different                    intrauterine positions are naturally exposed to different endogenous            blood steroid levels during fetal life due to being randomly positioned         in utero between 2 male fetuses (these males have elevated serum levels         of testosterone) or between 2 female fetuses (these males have elevated         serum levels of estradiol).  The intrauterine position of males will be         identified at cesarean delivery, and they will be raised for                    examination during later life.  The second approach will involve                treating pregnant females with either estradiol or testosterone to              slightly increase serum concentrations of these steroids during sexual          differentiation in all male fetuses of treated mothers.  He will                examine lifespan, the incidence of tumors in old age, fertility (the            capacity to successfully mate with females and sire young), and                 functioning of the prostate and seminal vesicles (as assessed by enzyme         activity and capacity to bind hormones) during aging in male mice.                                                                                              During the fetal period of differentiation of the brain and                     reproductive system, individuals in all mammalian species may be                exposed to markedly different levels of sex steroid hormones due to a           variety of reasons.  While it is known that individual differences in           many characteristics relating to reproduction in young-adult animals            are determined by levels of sex hormones during fetal life, no one has          examined whether  lifespan of the pattern of reproductive aging in              males might be predicted by fetal sex hormone levels.  In most                  mammalian species, including man, there are a few aged males who retain         the capacity to reproduce, while the majority of males become                   reproductively inactive in old age. The proposed experiments should             provide important information concerning why such dramatic differences          in reproductive capacity and lifespan are observed between individual           males.",
