 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Program is funding Dr. Paul Helquist of                   the Department of Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame to                  continue his research on new methods in synthetic organic and                   organometallic chemistry.  The important unifying themes among                  the subprojects are the construction of carbocyclic ring                        systems, the development of organometallic reagents with a                      special emphasis on transition metals, and the development of                   reactions that take place with asymmetric induction.                                                                                                            First, iron-carbene complexes will be studied to test the                       ability of these reactive intermediates to undergo C-H                          insertion and cationic olefinic cyclization.  Chiral-at-iron                    derivatives will be used to test aysmmetric versions of the                     reactions.  Second, intermediates derived from the reaction                     between ketone enolates and cyclopropane derivatives will be                    used as precursors cyclopentanone annulation, formation of                      polycyclic fused cycloheptanone systems and three-carbon                        segments for the synthesis of large-ring systems. Third, the                    concept of diastereofacial selective coordination of alkenes                    and the subsequent use of the coordinated alkenes for chiral                    synthesis will be extended to include organic pi-donor ligands                  in general.",
