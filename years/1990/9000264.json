 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research builds on previous findings that qualitative and                  quantitative differences exist in the secondary metabolites                     produced by kelp-like plants between the temperate northeast and                southwest Pacific regions. The purpose of the research is to: 1)                further document variation in the levels and kinds of secondary                 chemicals among large brown algae from California and New                       Zealand, and 2) determine behavioral and long term responses of                 selected marine plant-eating invertebrates to these compounds.                  Extensive collections will be made from both areas to document                  variation in concentrations of polyphenolic and lipophilic                      compounds among the common brown algal species; among individuals               and tissues within species; and through time in detached plants.                Feeding preferences of common sea urchins and snails from both                  regions will be tested for the effects of these secondary                       compounds by measuring variation in consumption rate.                           Physiological influences of secondary metabolites on various                    plant-eating invertebrates will be evaluated by measuring                       absorption efficiencies, growth rates, and gonadal development                  among experimental treatments in which the kinds and levels of                  secondary metabolites are varied.  Hypothetically interactions                  between algae and the animals which consume them will differ                    among these regions in two important ways: 1) the amount and                    diversity of chemical defenses in New Zealand algae will be                     greater than in California species; and 2) the algae eaters in                  New Zealand will be more tolerant of polyphenolics than will                    similar algal consuming invertebrates from California.  Overall,                the mechanisms which mediate transfer of energy from the algae                  which are the dominant primary producers on temperate rocky                     shores to the invertebrates which consume them are predicted to                 vary greatly on a biogeographical scale.",
