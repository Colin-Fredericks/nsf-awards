 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective support for analysis, verification, and testing requires              coordinated application of a variety of techniques.  As the                     difficulties of analyzing concurrent software are especially severe,            so it is especially important that multiple techniques be brought to            bear on the problem.  This project will develop and demonstrate a               general approach to integrating analysis techniques applied to the              detection of synchronization faults in concurrent software.  A set of           tool components for analysis of concurrent programs will be embedded            in a software development environment.  A reachability analysis                 technique will be used to detect classes of faults  (race conditions,           for instance) that are particularly difficult to detect with other              analysis and testing techniques.  A new technique for divide-and-               conquer analysis will be implemented.  Flexible control of                      effort/accuracy tradeoffs and the option of filtering reports of                potential errors through other analysis and testing techniques will be          used to control the shortcomings of reachability analysis as a stand-           alone technique.  The concurrency analysis tool set will serve as an            experimental test-bed for investigating novel combinations of                   techniques, including integration of reachability analysis with                 symbolic execution.",
