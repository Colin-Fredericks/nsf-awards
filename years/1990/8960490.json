 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility of scaling                     up High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separations                    in the displacement mode of chromatography for the                              production of pharmaceutical grade synthetic peptides and                       recombinant proteins. In certain cases, HPLC is the only                        large scale process step that yields the purity levels                          required for human therapeutic use. Conventional elution                        chromatography can be conveniently scaled up to the level                       required in manufacturing, but is expensive, poorly utilizes                    column capacity and is difficult to reproducible operate.                       The displacement mode is performed under conditions similar                     to conventional HPLC operations, but instead of a gradient                      in eluent strength, the feed components are displaced from                      the column by a carefully chosen solution containing a                          component that is more strongly adsorbed than any of the                        feed components.  The purified product exits the column in                      adjacent bands of individual components just ahead of the                       displacer front.  Concentrations and column loadings in this                    mode of chromatography are typically ten- to one                                hundred-fold higher than in elution chromatography, and so                      displacement more fully exploits the column and equipment                       capacity.  These factors together with simplified control                       aspects make displacement chromatography a promising                            manufacturing step.",
