 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seed distribution, plant demography and spatiotempporal                    heterogeneity ofthe environment, by their interactions, determine               the ecological and evolutionary landscape inhabited by an                       organism.  A simple hypothesis that quantitatively links these                  three areas of evolutionary ecology in a new way is proposed.  A                model of plant population dynamics and forest dynamics predicts                 that ant-dispersed species will be characterized by a slower                    rate of demographic change during gap-phase regeneration than                   bird-dispersed species.  Selection for these divergent seed                     dispersal syndromes (local dispersal vs. long-distance dispersal)               will be investigated in a family of understory herbs by comparing               changes in demography, light environments and disperser                         assemblages during gap-phase regeneration.  Preliminary data                    confirmed that the Costa Rican Marantaceae provide an excellent                 opportunity for the study.  The static distribution of plants in                forest light habitats was significantly associated with dispersal               syndrome, suggesting differences in their dynamic response to                   intermediate habitats during gap-phase regeneration.",
