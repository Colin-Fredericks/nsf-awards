 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work initiated in an earlier effort                      dealing with the phenomenon of vibration isolation in structures                with parametric uncertainties and irregularities, and focusing on               generating fundamental insights into the physical mechanisms of                 localization from the study of generic idealized models of                      periodic structures.  The current project looks at three issues                 which are (a) the evaluation and prediction of the significance                 of localization effects in engineering structures, (b) the                      development of concise statistical tools for the analyst and                    designer confronted with uncertainties in structural dynamics                   applications, and (3) the use of these novel techniques and                     insights to develop a theory for vibration transmission in                      complex structures.  An experimental verification of localization               effects will be performed on a multi-span beam.  The impact of                  the work is clear.  Many large structures, i.e., truss beams,                   turbomachinery rotors, submarine hulls, overhead power lines,                   etc., are periodic.  Their design and analysis is based on the                  assumption that the periodicity is perfect.  This not the case,                 and often periodic structures can be highly sensitive to small                  irregularities in manufacturing tolerances.  Neglecting these                   variations may lead to erroneous results and serious                            consequences.  This research focuses on correcting this problem                 through development of new techniques for vibrational analysis of               large periodic structures.",
