 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past two decades, Stanford has conducted a highly                       successful summer workshop that has served as a gathering place                 for extended research interactions among economic theorists.  The               intellectual and physical environment, extended program format,                 experienced staff, and support from the University have combined                to make the Stanford program uniquely successful over many years.               Stanford's program extends over 6-8 weeks with many visitors in                 residence for the whole period and most in residence for at least               four weeks.  During this period, there are about 8-10 hours per                 week of scheduled seminars.  The balance of the time provides                   extensive opportunities for sustained interaction among a large                 number of researchers.  This format has proved to be especially                 valuable for younger researchers, who have found the summer                     workshop a fertile environment for developing their ideas and                   beginning collaborations.                                                                                                                                       Support for this successful series of workshops and seminars                    should be renewed because of its likely contributions to economic               theory.  For 1990 Stanford's summer program centers on three                    themes: New Keynesian Approaches to Macroeconoimcs, Economics                   with Increasing Returns, and the Economics of Organizations.                    Each topic will begin with a workshop and continue with a series                of paper presentations organized around the main theme.  Some of                these topics are likely to be continued into the summers of 1991                and 1992, along with the topics of Dynamical Economic Systems and               the Theory of the Second Best.",
