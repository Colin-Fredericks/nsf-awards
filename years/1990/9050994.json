 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Siena College Physics Department is developing a clear                      curricular path that a student can follow to gain significant                   experience in an area of experimental physics.  The Department is               adding major equipment in four areas:  optical spectroscopy,                    holography, x rays and nuclear physics.  The new equipment is first             used in the sophomore labs.  A new junior-level laboratory course               in experimental physics is being developed to reinforce the gains               made in the sophomore labs by allowing students to continue to use              the equipment, but at a higher level.  Finally, when the students               reach the senior year and are required to carry out an independent              project, they have a solid base of skills and knowledge in one or               more experimental physics areas, which they can then pursue                     intensively.  Also, students performing research independent of the             required senior project have many more options from which to                    select.                                                                                                                                                         The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
