 "awd_abstract_narration": "In black cherry (Prunus serotina) seeds, large-scale catabolism                 of the cyanogenic glycoside (R)-amygdalin to HCN occurs only upon               tissue disruption.  Antibodies will be raised against three                     glycoproteins (amygdalin hydrolase, prunasin hydrolase, and                     mandelonitrile lyase) catalyzing amygdalin degradation to                       determine their tissue and subcellular localizations by                         immunohistochemical techniques.  Together with the localization                 of amygdalin by subcellular fractionation or immunochemical                     means, this will reveal the mode of compartmentation preventing                 cyanogenesis in intact seeds.  Preliminary to future research on                the genetic regulation of cyanogenesis, the phenomenon of                       cyanogensis will be followed during fruit development from                      flowering to maturity by measuring the levels of cyanogenic                     glycosides and of the above catabolic enzymes.  The levels of                   mRNAs encoding these proteins will also be assessed by in vitro                 translation studies with methionine labeled with a radioisotope                 of sulfur.                                                                                                                                                      Many commercially important crops cause acute and chronic cyanide               poisoning in humans and livestock due to the release of hydrogen                cyanide (HCN) from cyanogenic glycosides by endogenous enzymes.                 This research will investigate the metabolism of cyanogenic                     glycosides in black cheryy.  Detailed knowledge of the                          biosynthesis, sequestration, and degradation of these glycosides                will greatly facilitate efforts to reduce the toxicity of such                  plants and clarify the role of cyanogenesis in plant-animal                     interactions.",
