 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will attempt to demonstrate that                     information from modern mammalian communities and those                         preserved in the recent fossil record is pertinent to                           understanding mammalian community organization past and present.                A model of community organization in relation to one of its                     important causes -- climatic conditions -- based on both modern                 and late Quaternary communities should be more powerful than a                  model based on modern communities and climates alone.  The                      inclusion of late Quaternary mammalian faunas and climates                      broadens the information base and also adds communities and                     environments more similar to those of the Tertiary than any                     extant ones are.                                                                     Previous studies of size distributions in mammalian                        communities as well as a pilot study presented here suggest that                regularities are present in community structure under similar                   environmental conditions despite differences in location and                    taxonomic composition, but these regularities remain to be                      quantified.  Quantification of the relationship between                         environmental parameters and the distribution of species' sizes                 and feeding habits will serve to clarify and measure the strength               of this relationship.  If this relationship is strong, then it                  can serve as the basis for a quantitative method for estimating                 paleoenvironmental conditions in older mammalian communities.                   In addition, this study will provide hypotheses of the adaptive                 significance of size-change during the Cenozoic record of                       changing mammalian faunas and environments..  These specific goal               can also be generalized to allow analyses of environmental                      changes through time .",
