 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this continuing research is to produce a                         quantitative economic history of the emergence and perfection of                efficient and integrated international capital markets during the               period 1811-1914.  This study will also involve developing a data               base consisting of the share price lists published regularly for                the stock exchanges of London, Amsterdam, Paris, and New York.                  The research results will provide new insights into the                         disruptions and subsequent adjustments in the pricing of                        internationally-traded financial assets that are created by the                 addition of new markets and traders, changes in government                      regulations of existing markets, changes in institutional design                of stock markets, or advances in the technology of communications               linking the various financial markets.  This research is                        important because it will provide a quantitative standard of                    market integration and efficiency that can be used to calibrate                 measures of financial market operation in other periods.                        Further, the nineteenth century is an especially interesting                    period for establishing such measures for evaluating current                    developments in international financial markets.  This period is                characterized by the spread of financial capitalism to variety of               countries with very different legal and institutional histories,                and by the integration of the corresponding secondary markets in                transferable securities through the first telecommunications                    revolution.  Also, this period ends with rise of increasing                     regulation of stock exchanges in the form of both self-regulation               and state regulation.",
