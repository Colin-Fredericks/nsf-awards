By building a simulation           environment that takes advantage of the usage characteristics of                workstation owners, improvements of the quality of service is enjoyed           by all users.  The system will enable users to submit project                   descriptions of simulation models to the system from which they will            receive graphical displays of the results.  The project descriptions            include a specification of the simulation jobs to be executed, the              time constraints of the project, and characteristics of the jobs.  An           important feature to be developed and evaluated is the system's                 deadline-driven scheduling facility.  Simulation jobs will be                   scheduled to meet the deadlines of the time constraints imposed on the          jobs.  In addition, the scheduler will allow users to be allocated              partitions of idle workstations for developing distributed                      applications.  In order to provide scheduling strategies for meeting            deadlines and allocating partitions of idle workstations, workload              models of the usage characteristics of workstations are being                   developed.",
