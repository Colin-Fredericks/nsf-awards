 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is motivated by the proposition that the tremendous               successes of computers in supporting individual decision making can             be repeated for distributed decision making.  If this comes to pas,             the positive implications for organization effectiveness are likely             to be as significant and far reaching as those already witnessed for            individual productivity.  What is needed first is a theory of how               organizations represent and process knowledge.  This project                    involves the formulation and linguistic formalization of such a                 theory.  The theory aims to embody constructs and principles that               can serve as a basis for describing, studying, designing, testing               and managing human/computer distributed decision making systems from            a knowledge oriented perspective.  Development of the theory                    necessarily draws on and integrated related research in organization            science, Computer science, and decision science.  Efficacy of the               theory and language is tested on an experimental basis.  Specific               research topics addressed within the prioritized research plan                  include the treatment of decision instigation, goal-drive and goal-             less processing, inter-role design, event-triggered processing,                 concurrent problem processing, servers, entity constitution,                    learning from experience, human interfaces, and participant                     coordination.",
