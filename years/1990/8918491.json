 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research using a variety of                            accelerators in the U.S., Canada, and Europe to study                           intermediate and high energy nuclear reactions.  These studies                  examine both the dynamics of nuclear reactions and the degrees                  of freedom required to describe the structure of nuclear                        states.  The work includes research on true absorption of in-                   flight pions by nuclei, including multi-nucleon absorption, as                  well as analyses of inelastic scattering to quantify the                        effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and its use in studying                   nuclear structure.  New experiments with medium energy protons                  will focus on  -meson and  -isobar production from light                        elements.  Research will also be conducted using                                electromagnetic interactions at higher energies focusing on the                 quark degrees of freedom of nuclei.  More conventional                          measurements of the structure of nuclei and studies of reaction                 dynamics in terms of nucleonic degrees of freedom are also                      planned.  Design and development efforts will be conducted in                   preparation for new projects at CEBAF and PEGASYS.",
