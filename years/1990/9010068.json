 "awd_abstract_narration": "The internal cellular anatomy of wood has a fossil record                  extending back to the origin of the flowering plants, and beyond.               Dr. Elisabeth Wheeler is a leading expert on the fossil record of               wood anatomy, and she has been instrumental in assembling an                    international effort to construct a database of wood                            characteristics.  Dr. Wheeler has requested a Career Advancement                Award to allow her to gain the statistical and computing skills                 necessary to begin critical exploration of this data resource.                  Patterns of evolutionary and functional relationships will be                   established through this analysis, thereby clarifying the factors               behind the diversity of wood structures found alive today.                           Dr. Wheeler is uniquely qualified to lead both the expansion               and the analysis of the proposed database of wood anatomy.  The                 proposed career advancement activities will provide her with a                  realistic opportunity of expand and accelerate this research                    program.",
