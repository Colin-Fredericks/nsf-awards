 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitoids (insect parasites that invariably kill their                   hosts) often aggregate their attacks where their hosts are most                 abundant.  The degree to which attacks are aggregated, however,                 is highly variable--rates of parasitism (on a per victim basis)                 sometimes decrease with increasing host density.  Mathematical                  models have shown that the response to the density of their hosts               has profound consequences for the dynamics of the interaction.                  However, the mechanisms underlying aggregation are poorly                       understood.  The proposed research is intended to examine how an                aphid parasitoid alters its foraging in response to variation in                host density.  The goal of the research is to  develop a                        sufficient understanding of the microscale behavior of an aphid                 parasitoid that can predict within-generation population-level                  patterns in the field.  Most behavioral work to date on host-                   parasitoid interactions has been restricted to observations in                  simple laboratory environments or, if in the field, to                          observations of foraging on a single plant.  In contrast,                       although population studies of host-parasitoid interactions often               include information on spatial patterns, they rarely attend to                  the details of parasitoid behavior.  This project consists of lab               and field experiments closely coupled to mathematical models,                   which are used to extrapolate from individual behavior to                       patterns at the population level.",
