 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of                    stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB,            280-320nm) radiation.  The magnitude of ultraviolet radiation reaching          the surface now approaches that measured in tropical latitudes. Perhaps         more importantly, UVB radiation has increased in the Antarctic while            both UVA (320-400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR,           400-700nm) have remained unchanged.  Recent improvements in atmospheric         modeling and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in        a six week field study during the austral spring 1990.  The prime               objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the                 phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom.  During this          time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions for increased         UVB susceptibility.  Biological and bio-optical information will be used        to define and quantify linkages between ozone-dependent oscillations in         UV to PAR ratios and phytoplankton productivity.  Special emphasis will         be placed on defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and         altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to                 photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in         the Southern Ocean.  The overall aim is to test the hypothesis that             phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely influenced by ozone             depletion.",
