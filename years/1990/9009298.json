 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of how tracking in middle and secondary schools                affects student learning is critical for informed decision-making               about tracking practices.  This study will show how tracking                    affects students who differ by gender, race, and prior                          achievement.  Thus, it will reveal a source of potential                        inequities in our educational system.  The research will also                   demonstrate how variation between schools in tracking structures                and placement policies is a major, though largely ignored, source               of school differences in students learning.  The conceptual model               will be tested on longitudinal data from two cohorts of about                   2,100 students each, in several public, parochial, and private                  middle and secondary schools.  Seventh through tenth grade data                 have already been collected on these students.  The investigator                will collect information on their last two years in high school                 in this study.  She will conduct descriptive and inferential                    analyses to reveal the mechanisms that relate middle school                     tracking to opportunities for learning in high school.",
