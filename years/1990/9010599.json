 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is related to an                                          experimental and theoretical study of the                                       effects of cross-phase modulation (XPM) in                                      optical fibers and how such effects can be                                      used for influencing the behavior of one                                        optical pulse by copropagating it together                                      with another ultrashort pulse.  The project                                     is divided into three parts.  The first                                         part is concerned with the XPM interaction                                      between the pump pulse and the Stokes pulse                                     that is generated internally through the                                        process of stimulated Raman scattering.                                         The second part is related to the XPM                                           interaction between the pump and signal                                         pulses launched simultaneously at the fiber                                     input.  The pump and signal pulses are                                          allowed to have different carrier                                               wavelengths, different pulse widths, and a                                      relative time delay between them.  The                                          third part is related to the XPM                                                interaction when the pump and signal pulses                                     have the same carrier wavelength but excite                                     the orthogonally polarized modes of a                                           single-mode fiber.  The objective is to                                         study how the XPM interaction can be used                                       to modify the propagation characteristics                                       of a signal pulse (such as its phase,                                           frequency, shape, or spectrum) through an                                       intense pump pulse.  The study is useful                                        for many engineering applications in the                                        fields of photonic switching and high-                                          speed optical communications.",
