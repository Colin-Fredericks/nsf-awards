 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to determine the cellular and                      molecular basis of intracellular calcium signalling mechanisms                  operating within cultured smooth muscle cells.  Cell biological                 and biochemical approaches will be applied to analyze the                       molecular basis of two recently identified mechanisms controlling               the release and transfer of calcium within cells activated by                   inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) and guanosine 5'-                           triphosphate (GTP), respectively.  The project has three specific               objectives:  1. Identification of the nature and organization of                intracellular calcium pools.  Studies will assess the function of               calcium regulatory organelles in clonal and primary smooth muscle               cell cultures, identify at the subcellular level those organelles               responsive to InsP3 and GTP, and use electron microscopy and                    electron probe microanalysis to localize intracellular calcium                  pools.  2. Analysis of the mechanisms of intracellular calcium                  transport activated by InsP3 and GTP.  Measurements will be made                on the nature and specificity of ion fluxes activated by InsP3                  and GTP, and on the physical and biochemical changes in the                     properties of intracellular membranes which correlate with GTP-                 activated calcium translocation.  3. Molecular characterization                 of the calcium translocation mechanisms.  Studies will attempt to               isolate and identify proteins involved in InsP3 and GTP-activated               calcium translocation and to determine immunochemically the                     existence of known calcium-regulatory proteins within discrete                  membrane subfractions from cells.  These studies represent a                    comprehensive approach to understanding the cellular location and               molecular basis of the two calcium regulatory mechanisms, and                   will assess the validity of a model based on prior work which                   predicts that GTP induces the translocation of calcium between                  distinct calcium pumping organelles, including that responsive to               InsP3.                                                                                                                                                          Changes in intracellular free calcium are involved in the signal                transduction pathways for a large number of important cellular                  messages such as hormones and electrical excitation.  The                       regulation of intracellular calcium by cellular organelles                      is thus critical for the function of all cells.  With prior NSF                 support Dr. Gill has discovered that in subcellular fractions two               calcium pumping activities can be distinguished (in addition to                 mitochondria), presumably corresponding to different organelles.                The molecule, GTP, causes calcium to shift from one of these                    calcium-pumping organelle to another.  These results reveal a new               level of complexity of cellular calcium regulation and signal                   transduction.  Continuation of support for this research will                   permit further analysis of this important finding and permit more               detailed characterization of the mechanisms involved in                         regulation of intracellular calcium.",
