 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interinstitutional REU site is established.  The program will                provide ten selected undergraduates research opportunities in the               mechanical engineering and engineering science department encompassing          the mechanical, materials and bioengineering subject areas.  The                specific research topics selected for the program are of fundamental,           as well as, current engineering interest including several to be                conducted with external support and collaborations.  A five-member              faculty team from the host institution will supervise the  project              activities.  Research projects are thermal compatibility for metal-             ceramic systems, properties of liquid metal-liquid insulator                    interfaces, control-structure interaction of large flexible                     spacecraft, and diffraction studies of defect substructures in bulk             single crystals.  Participants will be recruited from both inside and           outside the host institution with special attention given to                    attracting qualified minority, handicapped and female students.  The            interinstitutional cooperative arrangement is intended to facilitate            the recruiting effort, allow several participants to work in on-going           joint projects to gain research experience and generally enhance the            impact of the REU program by spreading its benefits beyond host site.           Productive participation of the students in the project activities              will be assured through a concentrated ten-week summer involvement,             pairing of internal and external students on individual projects and            carefully planned orientation and post participation activities.  The           program will terminate with written reports and oral presentations of           the project results by the participants.",
