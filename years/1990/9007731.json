 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Combusting Flowfield Diagnostic System is to be purchased                     for probing the spatial characteristics of one- and two-phase                   reacting flows.  The system consists of three major                             components:  (1) a Nd:YAG laser capable of high pulse energies                  to illuminate the reacting flow under study, (2) a high                         resolution, solid-state camera to detect the scattered laser                    light, and (3) a supercomputer workstation with hardware                        dedicated to real time two-and three-dimensional graphics                       operations to control the laser and detectors, analyze and                      display the measured data, and perform computational tasks                      currently done at supercomputer centers.  Some specific                         experiments which will be performed with this equipment are as                  follows:  (1) measurement of species concentrations and                         temperatures in laminar premixed and nonpremixed flames;  (2)                   measurement of the temperature field and its full three-                        dimensional gradient at 106 points within a cross section of a                  turbulent flame;  (3) determination of the species inside a                     burning droplet using stimulated Raman scattering or coherent                   anti-Stokes Raman scattering;  (4) simultaneous spectral and                    spatial imaging of fuel droplets, which will allow the                          determination of size and chemical makeup of several particles                  in a single laser pulse; and  (5) study of the burning of                       micron-sized solid particles in a range or aggregation regimes                  by electrospray techniques.                                                                                                                                     The potential impact of laser diagnostic measurements and                       computational methods on combustion research is great.  By                      performing measurements in two or three dimensions, the                         characteristics of large-scale structures can be determined                     and the interaction between the fluid motion and the chemistry                  studied.  The cooperative experimental and computational                        effort will benefit both portions of the research.",
