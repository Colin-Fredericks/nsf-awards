 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic research has been extremely dynamic in recent decades,          making the quadrennial congresses sponsored by the International                Geographical Union (IGU) especially important settings at which                 scholars from throughout the world meet to exchange the most current            results of their research and to plan future collaborative activities.          The 27th Congress of the ISPRS will be held in Washington, D.C., in             early August 1992, providing an excellent opportunity for American              scientists to meet directly with experts from throughout the rest of            the world.  This award provides support for the 1992 IGU Congress in            two ways.  First it provides financial assistance to offset costs of            the planning and operation of the congress.  Second, it provides a              means by which other federal government agencies may provide financial          support through interagency agreements that will fund supplements to            the initial award.                                                                   This award will provide valuable financial assistance for the              planning and operation of the largest and most significant gathering of         geographers from throughout the world since the 1984 IGU Congress in            Paris.  As has been true of past IGU activities, enhanced scholarship           and increased involvement in international collaborative activities by          American geographers will result.  Further positive consequences of             this grant will be realized if NSF can assist in channelling                    contributions from other federal agencies to this important activity.",
