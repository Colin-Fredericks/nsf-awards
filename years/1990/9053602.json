 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to investigate the evolution of an               innovative second grade problem solving mathematics project, compatible         with recent NCTM guidelines (NCTM, 1989), to determine how the                  implementation of the project is influenced by broad cultural, social,          and political forces.  Specifically, the perspectives held by parents,          community leaders (school board members), school administrators,                teachers, and the university project directors about what mathematics           instruction should look like and how teachers should be teaching and            students should be learning will be compared and contrasted.  These             perspectives (values and beliefs about mathematics) are important in            light of the voice and power parents, community leaders and                     administrators have in influencing innovative change in mathematics.            Using the research methodology of ethnography and the theoretical               underpinnings of holistic ethnography and symbolic interactionism, the          perceptions about this innovative project will be studied through               intensive observations, interviews, and document analysis.  Questions           guiding the data collection include, what happens when university               researchers and public school in general and mathematics in particular,         play in influencing what occurs in mathematics classrooms?  and what            role do parents and school board members play in informing and                  developing school district instructional policy and how do they                 influence the process of educational change in mathematics?  Data will          be analyzed and interpreted using qualitative, inductive procedures.            This project may serve as a paradigm case for those who want to learn           more about the complexities associated with implementing innovative             mathematics programs that are compatible with recent reform                     recommendations (e.g. NCTM, 1989).",
