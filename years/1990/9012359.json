 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTERFACE is an annual, national interdisciplinary conference                   devoted to the study and discussion of the interrelationship                    between the sciences, technologies, and humanities.  Created in                 1976, INTERFACE is co-sponsored by the Humanities and Technology                Association and the Humanities and Social Sciences Department of                Southern College of Technology.  The conference provides a forum                for the examination of new and ongoing problems and issues that cut             across the natural and physical sciences, technology, the social                sciences, and the humanities.  This examination includes the                    ethical considerations that must be addressed when such issues and              problems are raised.  The conference attracts experts in such                   fields as physics, chemistry, ethics, literature, history,                      engineering, computer science, sociology, and the fine arts.  This              modest award will help INTERFACE to support some administrative and             special publication costs associated with the conference, while its             directors developing plans to make it self-sustaining in future                 years.                                                                                                                                                          There are very few professional settings where discussion of                    interdisciplinary research interests is possible.  This conference              is one of them.  The organizers and host organizations have a track             record of success.  This modest request will enable the project                 organizers to develop plans and activities that will give the                   conference more visibility and a better base of long-term support.              Results will improve interdisciplinary communication.  A one year               award is recommended.",
