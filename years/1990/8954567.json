 "awd_abstract_narration": "Towson State University in collaboration with the Baltimore                     City Public Schools (BCPS) and the National Urban Coalition                     (NUC) will provide a teacher enhancement program that will                      reinforce the newly adopted hands-on science curriculum for all                 of the 124 elementary schools in the city of Baltimore. This is                 part of Baltimore's \"Operation Turnaround\".                                                                                                                     This five-year teacher enhancement project will provide teacher                 training opportunities for 2000 elementary teachers (grades K-                  5) to help them implement and phase in this new curriculum.                     Meaningful involvement by the principals as well as the                         community will reinforce the teachers' efforts. Twelve science                  educators, sixteen teachers and two principals, members of the                  BCPS science supervisory staff, the project director and                        associate project director, a total of 36 people, will become                   leader-coaches.  This group will provide continued direct                       support to the school during the summer and school years. Two                   teachers from each school will be involved in leadership                        training as well as content and instructional updating to                       provide continuity and resources at the home sites.                                                                                                             Teachers from eight schools in year one and twenty-nine schools                 in each of the next four years (total of 124 schools) will                      participate in a five-day intensive summer workshop held in one                 of the Baltimore County Public Schools and taught by selected                   members of the leader-coach team.  In addition, teachers will                   elect to take up to four content courses at the University to                   update their science backgrounds.                                                                                                                               Specific activities for parents and community members are                       included in the project.  A \"Say Yes to Science\" Communications                 Kit for active community members, the use of \"Family Math\" and                  \"Family Science\" (from EQUALS and NUC) in parents workshops,                    field trips to the Maryland Science Center, the National                        Aquarium and the Baltimore Zoo are components of the school                     support program. A workshop for principals will ensure the                      understanding and support of the administration at each school.                                                                                                 The Baltimore City Public Schools will cost-share an amount                     equivalent to 38% of the NSF request with an additional 2%                      coming from other sources.  This large commitment by BCPS is                    indicative of their sincerity in the improvement of elementary                  science education.  //",
