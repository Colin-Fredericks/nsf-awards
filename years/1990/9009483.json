 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of parallel and vector                                          algorithms for solving very large                                               matrix algebraic Riccati equations is                                           proposed. The approach to be used                                               stresses the use of computational                                               kernels such as the BLAS3, which are                                            available on a wide variety of                                                  parallel computers.  This approach                                              will make the algorithms portable to                                            many advanced scientific computers.                                             Much of the research is based on the                                            matrix sign function algorithm, an                                              iterative method that has been shown                                            to work well on a certain class of                                              multiprocessor.  Topics  for research                                           include easily parallelized                                                     \"multiplication rich\" algorithms,                                               parallel and vector algorithms for                                              several different advanced computer                                             architectures, a condition estimate                                             computable using the matrix sign                                                function, and iterative algorithms for                                          solving the linear Lyapunov equation.                                           Finally, implementation of the                                                  algorithms as high quality, reliable                                            mathematical software is proposed, in                                           order to make the results of the                                                research available for use by the                                               control systems community.  The                                                 solution of algebraic Riccati                                                   equations is a fundamental                                                      computational problem in control                                                engineering and is essential for the                                            application of many modern control                                              techniques.",
