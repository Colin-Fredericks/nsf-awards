 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human error has been identified as a major cause of failure                in engineering designs ranging from simple structures to complex                systems.  A model of how errors are introduced into the design                  process will provide not only insight into an often neglected                   aspect of design theory and methodology but also an understanding               of how errors may be reduced in future designs.                                      Paradigms based on classic examples of design error and                    error avoidance constitute a most effective means of approaching                the problem of failure due to human design error will be                        developed.  By basing paradigms on actual case studies, the human               element can be naturally incorporated and caveats made relevant                 to practicing designers.                                                             Since the concept of failure provides a unifying theme for                 all components of the design process, paradigms based on cogent                 case studies of failure and failure avoidance also present a                    means of unifying the large mass of past design experience into a               coherent structure.   Furthermore, by distilling design                         principles from the paradigms, the lessons learned in one                       engineering domain will be more easily transferrable to others.                 This will enable design theorists, practitioners, and students                  alike to have access to a uniquely broad base of experience and                 examples.                                                                            The hypothesis that general design paradigms can be based on               specific case histories will be tested by demonstrating that a                  wide variety of other case studies exhibit the same design error                or error avoidance principles.  The supporting case studies will                be drawn from several historical periods to demonstrate that the                design principles embodied in the paradigms are truly timeless                  and independent of the state-of-the-art.  The case studies will                 also be drawn from a range of engineering domains to demonstrate                the validity of the hypothesis for design generally and thus to                 demonstrate the universal applicability of the paradigms.",
