 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology               who is studying the cognitive structure of emotions in a rural                  area of Indonesia.  Studies have shown that cognition depends on                organized structures of information, called \"schemas\".  Little is               known of how children learn such schemas.  This project will                    explore how schemas develop in the process of acquisition by                    children, how children's use of them changes, and how children                  acquire them through social interaction.  Methods will involve                  direct observation and in-depth interviews.                                                                                                                     This research is important because comparative cases and analyses               of how children learn cognitive elements will give us material                  useful in helping us understand how to deal with deficits and                   abnormalities in this critical procedure.",
