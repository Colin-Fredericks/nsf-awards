 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study the industrial                               applicability of his ongoing research in the area of                            statistical quality control.  He plans to put a case for                        the usage of combined Shewhart cumulative score charts as                       a viable process control tool.  He argues that his                              procedures are easy to understand and that properties of                        these procedures are easier evaluated than the cusum type                       schemes.  He has shown that the combined Shewhart                               cumulative quality control procedure, in theory, is more                        sensitive to shifts in the process mean and/or                                  variability than both the standard Shewhart and the                             improved Shewhart schemes.  It has also been shown to                           compare favorably with the standard cusum type charts.                          The PI proposes to implement his procedures and compare                         their performance against the Shewhart and cusum type                           charts using real data.  He intends to identify local                           companies and academic institutions where these                                 procedures can be implemented.",
