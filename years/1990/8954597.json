 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of  Dr. Richard Olenick of the University                    of Dallas (UD) the Mechanical Universe High School Adaption                     (MUHSA) will be used in workshops for leader teachers and                       underprepared teachers.  During each of three successive                        summers leader teachers (4, 10 and 10 respectively) will                        attend intensive three week workshops at UD to hone their                       skills in using MUHSA materials.  In turn they will offer                       MUHSA workshops for 10 underprepared teachers in their local                    area.  Following their initial summer workshop these leader                     teachers will return to UD each summer for one-week review                      workshops.  The leader teachers will also offer follow-up                       support, during the academic year, to the underprepared                         teachers from their workshops.  Over the course of the                          project 24 leader teachers will participate and 140                             underprepared teachers.  During the third year another 240                      underprepared teachers will participate with no-NSF funding.                    The workshops will provide underprepared teachers with                          important fundamental content of high school physics                            curricula, a new approach to many ideas of physics,                             historical enrichment on the discoveries of physics and                         instructional methodologies to effectively implement MUHSA.                                                                                                     The quality of the MUHSA materials has been enhanced by the                     cycles of development, evaluation, adjustment, re-evaluation                    and refinement.  This project design is continued in the                        workshops and associated activities.  In following this                         design it avoids one of the major pitfalls associated with                      the curriculum development work of the 1960s.  Documentation                    of this project's success will provide a basis for national                     dissemination.                                                                                                                                                  Follow-up activities including a newsletter and electronic                      communication will be facilitate using support from UD and                      the National Diffusion Network.  The videotapes of the MUHSA                    will be supplied to each participant using non-NSF funds as                     well as VCRs for schools that cannot afford them.  With NSF                     funding being phased out for the underprepared teachers in                      the third year of the project and being replaced by non-NSF                     funds there is an excellent possibility the project will                        continue after the NSF grant period.                                                                                                                            The cost sharing in an amount of $329,600 is equal to 39% of                    the NSF award.",
