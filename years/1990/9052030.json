 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is increasing student participation in experimental                psychology by having students experience many important                         experiments as subjects, as experimenters, and as data analysts.                The addition of six computers to the lab enhances participation                 as subjects at the introductory levels. At the upper division                   level, students are involved in designing and implementing                      experiments, and in statistical analysis of data from experiments               addressing contemporary issues in psychology. Many experimental                 psychologists now use computers to display stimuli and record                   responses, and statistical analysis of data is also largely                     computer-based. Improvements in software now permit more students               to learn to set up their own experiments for course projects and                honors research. The aim is for students to see experimentation                 as a part of their experience in psychology, thus enhancing the                 teaching and learning of content areas, methodology, and                        statistics. The university will contribute an amount equal to the               award.",
