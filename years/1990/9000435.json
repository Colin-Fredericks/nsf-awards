 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detailed surveys of a propagating spreading center along the East               Pacific Rise (EPR) at 95.5W show that plate boundary                            configurations, rather than being static, can undergo complex                   geometric changes.  Models based on either dynamic, kinematic or                mechanical processes within the crust and mantle have been                      developed to explain these intricacies.  However, the                           applicability of these models to other propagating systems has                  yet to be established, and Dr. Martinez will conduct an                         evaluation of the various models by examining previously acquired               data from the Pito Deep area at 23S on the EPR.  This area                      contrasts with the 95.5 propagator in severval ways: the Pito                   Deep propagator is advancing along a broad \"front\", not a \"tip\"                 as at 95.5N;  local topography varies enormously from a regional                mean of 3500m to a local depression of 5980m;  and complex                      topography north of the rift mimics the fabric and trend of the                 rift zone, suggesting an unusually strong coupling across this                  region.  Any or all of these constrasts may be explained by the                 fact that Pito Deep is offset along a long (300 km vs 30 km for                 the feature at 95.5N) transform and intrudes into unusually old                 lithosphere (3 my vs 1 my).  Dr. Martinez will grid existing                    SeaMARCII bathymetry and construct a terrain-corrected Bouger                   anomaly map of the Pito Deep region.  With this and with                        assumptions of the nature of isostatic compensation he will                     calculate residual gravity anomalies to identify anomalies due to               Moho topography.  Anomalies that remain after this procedure will               form the basis for testing among the competing models that                      require either: 1) viscous flow in the asthenosphere, 2) thermal                effects due to dike intrusion, or 3) mechanical implications of a               lithosphere of finite strength.",
