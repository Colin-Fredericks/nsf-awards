 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and                 number theory of Professor David Harbater of the University of                  Pennsylvania. Dr. Harbater has proposed to continue his study of                Galois covers of arithmetic varieties and of arithmetic                         intersection theory. He will work to construct Galois covers over               the rational line having special type of Galois group and                       ramification, and in his intersection-theoretic work, he plans to               use a horizontal pairing that he has recently defined in order to               study arithmetic surfaces and to enlarge the Arakelov divisor                   group and study the fine structure at infinity.                                      This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
