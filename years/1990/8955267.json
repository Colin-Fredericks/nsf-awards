 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Workshop will introduce teachers of secondary school                       science and mathematics to recent developments in solid state                   digital technology and their application.  The logical                          terminal operation of devices will be emphasized, rather than                   their internal physical behavior.                                                                                                                               The Workshop consists of an intensive three week course in                      computer technology beginning with a treatment of number                        systems, Boolean algebra, and logic gates and proceeds                          through the applications and programming of microprocessors.                    It will meet daily for three weeks during the summer of 1990.                   Each daily session will consist of classroom lectures and                       demonstrations followed by \"hands-on\" experience in the                         laboratory.  For most of the experiments to be performed, the                   requisite laboratory equipment is minimal and inexpensive.  A                   modern logic breadboard contains all the hardware necessary                     for most of these experiments in a single package.                                                                                                              The Workshop will use the classroom and laboratory space of                     the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of                   Louisville, and will be taught by members of the Electrical                     Engineering faculty.  Participants will receive three                           semester hours of credit, with no tuition cost, a stipend and                   textbook.                                                                                                                                                       Forty participants from Jefferson County and Kentucky, as                       well as in the counties in Southern Indiana adjacent to the                     Louisville area will have this opportunity.  Members of                         minority groups and women will be encouraged to participate.                                                                                                    A series of follow-on sessions during the 1990-91 Academic                      Year will be presented to help the participants with the                        implementation of the workshop material in their curricula.                                                                                                     Cost sharing will be in the form of monies from school                          districts and local industries to provide participants with                     the single package, modern logic breadboard.  This cost                         sharing estimated to be $6,480 equals 10% of the NSF award.",
