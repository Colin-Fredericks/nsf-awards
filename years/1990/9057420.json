The objectives of the                      PYIA Program are to provide support to the Nation's most                        outstanding and promising young science and engineering                         faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of                                                                                                  U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly                                                                                                  qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and                    industrial research and teaching.  Dr. Packard's field of                       research is applied mathematics, with emphasis on linear                        algebra and control.                                                                                                                                            The research to be done can be split into three topics:                         analysis, design and modeling. Specifically:                                    (1) Analysis of linear fractional transformations- The                          motivation for this comes from control system design where it                                                                                                   is often natural to model individual components as a nominal                    model, along with a linear fractional perturbation set, which                                                                                                   together are called the \"model pair\".  The structured singular                                                                                                  value (ssv) of a matrix is the conceptual mathematical tool                     which answers many questions about the behavior of the matrix                                                                                                   when it is perturbed in a linear fractional manner.  The PI                     will use these tools to study the optimal synthesis of linear                                                                                                   systems.  His main theoretical goal is to develop a more                        unified approach which includes both one-dimensional, and                       multidimensional (for example, image processing) systems.  The                                                                                                  ssv will be the starting point for this research, since both                    types of systems, system properties (such as stability and                      input/output norms), and the robustness of these properties,                    are equivalent to ssv tests.                                                    (2) Robust Control Design- He plans to study computational                      problems with H-infinity design and the optimal                                 diagonally scaled problem (the diagonal scaling \"tricks\" H-                     infinity into designing robust closed loop systems).                            (3) Modeling- Improved models alleviate the problems of                         plant/model mismatch.  He plans to use ssv and H-                               infinity to produce sets of models from existing  modeling                      tools, rule out model pairs via measurements (invalidation),                    and produce models from measurements (identification).  He                      plans to experimentally verify these theoretical models.",
