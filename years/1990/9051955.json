 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the chemistry department provided its                     students with an FT-NMR to augment and revamp the laboratories in               biochemistry, inorganic, organic, and Integrated Laboratory.  A                 cobalt-complex-synthesis laboratory for freshmen includes use of                the FT-NMR.  Applications include the use of multinuclear spectra               (C-13, P-31, and N-15 and H-1), variable temperature (kinetics                  and thermodynamics measurements), proton decoupling (heterocyclic               compounds) and two-dimensional NMR (organic and inorganic as well               as student research project in biochemistry).  The four full-time               and two part-time faculty had all had experience with one or more               of the capabilities mentioned and provided hands-on usage for                   their students in laboratory and directed research.  The net                    effect of the acquisition of the instrumentation has been an                    enhanced laboratory experience and an opportunity for faculty to                be renewed through new laboratory experiments and techniques, as                a whole group, thus forging new links among the faculty and                     strengthening mutual support and curricular planning.                                                                                                           The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
