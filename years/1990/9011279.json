 "awd_abstract_narration": "An autonomous Administrative Domain (AD) is a set of resources                such as host computers, networks, and gateways, that is governed                by a single administrative authority.  Interconnections across                  ADs comes about through interconnection of private networks and                 by dividing an internet that has grown too large to manage.                                                                                                       Common approaches to network interconnection create a fully                   connected internet out of the constituent networks.  Network                    access control mechanisms have been designed for use in inter-AD                gateways to control access to end-systems in interconnected                     networks.  When networks are used for transit purposes as well as               for access to end-systems, however, these network access control                mechanisms are not adequate.                                                                                                                                      In this project critical aspects of the design, specification,                and prototype implementation of a first Inter-Domain Policy                     Routing protocol suite will be developed.  Initial                              experimentation will carried out in the University of Southern                  California computer science laboratory and will subsequently be                 tested over actual, cross-country, multi-administrative domain                  facilities.                                                                                                                                                       Thus, by incorporating policy-related contraints on inter-AD                  communication into route computation, this research provides for                essential maintenance and improvement of the research Internet                  and the research infrastructure it provides to scientists and                   engineers.***//",
