 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently we have found a genetic element (msDNA element) encoding               a reverse transcriptase (RT) and a branched, covalently linked                  RNA-DNA compound (msDNA-RNA compound) in the E.  coli                           B chromosome.  This genetic element is not present in E. coli K12               strains.  The msDNA-RNA compound is synthesized by a novel                      reverse transcription mechanism using the 2'OH of a specific                    internal guanine as a primer.  In order to understand the nature                of the msDNA element and a possible role of reverse transcription               in the evolution of procaryotes, we plan to characterize the                    msDNA element and the process of reverse transcription in E. coli               B by genetic and biochemical methods.  We will determine                        precisely its location and length, the structure of the msDNA                   element-chromosome junctions, and its functional components by                  comparative studies of the restriction sites and nucleotide                     sequences of E. coli B and E. coli K12 chromosomes in the                       vicinity of the msDNA element.  These experiments should show                   similarities and differences between the msDNA element of E. coli               B and retroelements in eucaryotes.  We will test the hypothesis                 that the msDNA element is a retrotransposon by assaying                         transpositional activity after putting a selective marker into                  the msDNA element.  We plan to purify the E. coli B RT and                      characterize its template-primer specificity, which would                       determine whether or not RT copies cellular RNA.  We also plan to               develop a simple system to study mutants in msDNA synthesis and                 to screen for RT inhibitors by taking advantage of the antisense                nature of msDNA.",
