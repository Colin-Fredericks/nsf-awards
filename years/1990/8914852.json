 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate weather forecasting in the vicinity of major                       mountain ranges is an extremely difficult meteorological problem.               Interactions between large-scale weather systems and mountainous                regions often spawn complex mesoscale weather patterns.  Efforts                to forecast the development of these weather patterns are limited               by deficiencies in understanding of the physical processes                      governing mesoscale circulations in complex terrain.                            Additionally, mesoscale orographic effects also influence the                   global circulation through the action of \"gravity wave drag\".                   Errors in the parameterization of gravity-wave drag in global-                  scale models are believed to be a major source of error in                      extended range forecasts.                                                           Under previous support from the National Science Foundation,                the Principal Investigator has studied airflow over mountains                   with the immediate goal of extending understanding of the                       dynamics of orographically generated mesoscale disturbances and                 the interaction between these disturbances and the large                        synoptic-scale flow.  He proposes to use a combination of theory,               numerical models and observations to continue this line of                      research.  The ultimate goal is to increase fundamental                         understanding leading to improved weather forecasts and climate                 models by developing a more accurate parameterization of gravity-               wave drag.//",
