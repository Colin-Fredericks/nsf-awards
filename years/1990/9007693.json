 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of a wide array of the evidential and inferential issues                  encountered in our system of law occupies researchers from many                 different disciplines.  Much attention has focused on the behavior              of jurors, attorneys, and judges.  Of equal importance, though not              so frequently studied, are the various inferential and decisional               tasks required of others such as investigators and advocates.  The              manner in which investigators and advocates play their roles has                a direct bearing upon subsequent inferences and choices made by                 other actors in the legal system.                                                                                                                               This research concerns the inferential and decisional roles played              by investigators and advocates during fact investigation and other              activities before a matter comes to trial or is settled by other                means.  The objectives of the project are to study ways of                      marshalling or organizing evidence that will enhance reasoning,                 structuring complex arguments, and assisting in decisionmaking at               various points during the preparation of criminal or civil cases.               The study involves computer-assisted simulations of complex cases               that will result in the structuring of \"inferential networks\" of                evidence marshalling methods.                                                                                                                                   This research is not only of theoretical and practical significance             in a legal context, but also bears on inferential and decisional                behavior in many other important contexts such as medicine,                     science, business, and intelligence analysis.  The results promise              to introduce new levels of rigor, clarity, and fairness into the                technology of proof and persuasion.  The linked networks of                     prototype computer-based evidence marshalling systems will be                   useful in illustrating theoretical issues in the practice and                   teaching of fact investigation and may provide the sound                        inferential basis now lacking in many current efforts to develop                computer-based litigation and other inference-related systems.",
