 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Evans, under the direction of faculty                     adviser Anderson at the University of Michigan is studying the                  species relationships and geographical distributions of palms of                the genus Cryosophila of Central and South America. This is a                   group of medium-sized, primarily low-elevation rainforest palms,                distributed from Pacific coastal Mexico to northwestern                         Colombia.  There are probably fewer than 10 distinct species of                 Cryosophila, but the exact number as well as the defining                       characteristics and distributions of each species are unknown.                  The first objective of this study is to identify, define and                    classify all Cryosophila species and determine their natural                    distributions.  Once this basic taxonomic information is known,                 the evolutionary history of the species within the genus will be                hypothesized using phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis, including                 study of Chelyocarpus and Itaya palms.                                               Cryosophila belongs to the most primitive group of palms,                  the subtribe Thrinacinae.  Whereas specialized groups of palms                  tend to be restricted to either the northern or southern                        hemisphere, thrinacine palms are more or less equally represented               in both hemispheres.  In the New World, however, Cryosophila is                 the only thrinacine palm having a distribution centered in                      Central America with extensions into both South America and                     Mexico.  The direction of evolution of new species in the genus                 should help determine areas of speciation and timing of                         speciation events.                                                                   The family Palmae is a morphologically diverse tropical to                 subtropical group having approximately 2600 species, most of                    which are restricted to rainforest habitats.  Due to the rapid                  destruction of these forests and the fact that a large majority                 of palm species are found only in the wild and have never been                  cultivated, species diversity in the palm family is seriously                   threatened.  Since most palms have historically been poorly                     collected and consequently are greatly under-represented in                     herbarium collections, the disappearance of palms in the wild                   will mean that the incredible diversity within the family will                  forever remain poorly understood.  From an economic standpoint,                 declining palm populations will have major consequences for                     tropical nations because palms provide an enormous array of                     useful products for local and regional use as well as for export.               Unfortunately, the severity of the problem is difficult to assess               and protective measures difficult to implement because many palm                species are poorly defined and/or their distributions are only                  partially understood.  That is, good taxonomic and biogeographic                data are critical for palm conservation efforts, for only when                  species are identifiable and their distributions known can                      actions be taken to harvest them in sustainable fashion and to                  protect them.  The research supported by this grant is designed                 to provide just such information for one group (the genus                       Cryosophila) of Mesoamerican palms.",
