 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year, half-time award enables a legal scholar and ethicist             at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University             of Maryland College Park to develop his understanding of theory and             research underlying the forensic applications of DNA typing.  He                will undertake a two-year course of study with the Division of                  Human Genetics at the University of Maryland at Baltimore,                      sponsored by Dr. Maimon Cohen, Director of the Division, and Dr.                Joann Boughman, Director of Graduate Studies.  Under their                      supervision, he will receive intensive training in molecular and                population genetics and DNA typing through classroom instruction                and laboratory rotations.  He will use this training in a program               of collaborative research with colleagues at the Institute for                  Philosophy and Public Policy and specialists in the forensic                    applications of genetic typing.  He expects to complete several                 articles during the grant period, to be submitted to journals in                law, public policy and criminology, and to begin work on a book.                                                                                                This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values                     studies:  the social values and mutual obligations and                          responsibilities that arise in the interactions between new                     developments in science and technology, and society.  The                       investigator and his host specialists and host institution are                  uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project;                  research and related activities are likely to continue after the                period of the award.  Results are likely to be appropriately                    disseminated and useful.  An award in the amount of $40,000 is                  therefore recommended.",
