 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I.'s intend to explore the mechanisms of interaction                 among terrestrial plants and their herbivores, including both                   direct interactions (e.g. herbivores consume plants) and                        indirect interactions (e.g. herbivores may affect the outcome of                plant competition by increasing soil nutrient concentration).                   previous studies of old field grasses and herbs and their major                 herbivores, grasshoppers, at their study site in central                        Minnesota indicate that (1) plants are limited by and compete for               soil nitrogen, (2) grasshopper reduce plant abundance and affect                plant species composition, and (3) grasshoppers are limited by                  and compete for plant food.  Based on these studies, the                        investigators propose three experiments to show how these                       interactions link together:                                                          (1) garden experiments in which the effects of different                   plants on soil nitrogen, plants on other plants, grasshoppers on                plants, grasshoppers on nitrogen, and grasshoppers on other                     grasshoppers will be measured separately and in combination on                  plots where soil nutrients, plant species composition, and                      grasshopper densities will be controlled,                                            (2) field experiments in which densities of six grasshopper                species will be manipulated to look at these same potential                     effects in a natural community, and                                                  (3) laboratory feeding experiments in which grasshoppers                   will be fed different plant species and their preference and                    physiological responses measured.                                                    These experiments will measure the mechanisms and strength                 of direct and indirect plant - herbivore interactions under                     controlled conditions, determine the role of herbivore diet                     selection in these interactions, and determine the importance of                these interactions in a real community containing the same plant                and grasshopper species.  This study may be the first to address                all three goals in a single, relatively simple, system.  The                    results will provide a foundation for predicting the outcome of                 these interactions and consequently, the structure of plant and                 herbivore communities.                                                                //",
