 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program focusing on mathematical problems in                    matrix theory will be supported through this Research Experiences               for Undergraduates award.  Eight students will work under the                   supervision of seven faculty members, using experimental and                    theoretical methods on a broad range of research topics.  An                    introduction to available sophisticated computing tools for                     mathematical exploration in matrix analysis: MATLAB, Mathematica,               Maple and GAUSS, will be provided, along with access to a new                   computer laboratory.  It is expected that students will present                 their work at regional meetings of the Mathematical Association                 of America.                                                                          Research projects such as the approximation of functions of                matrices will be taken up.  Here one considers interpolating                    polynomials of complex functions and how the corresponding                      functions of matrices approximate one another.  Another area of                 investigation concerns the convergence of products of matrices.                 For powers of a single matrix, the behavior of the sequence of                  its powers is well known.  When the terms of the product are                    selected from a finite set of matrices, relatively little is                    known about convergence.  Work will also be done on the                         relationship of the spectrum of a matrix and its permanent.  For                example, one would like to know the maximum permanent taken over                all matrices with a given spectrum.  Other topics include extreme               points of nonnegative matrices, matrix equation and sign pattern                matrices.",
