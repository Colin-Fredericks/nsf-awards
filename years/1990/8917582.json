 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hypersensitive response of plant cells to pathogenic microbes               and viruses is a rapid, local necrosis accompanied by                           transcriptional activation of defense genes.  These phenomena are               the primary bases for disease resistance in higher plants, yet                  the host-pathogen recognition process that initiates them is not                understood.  The objective of the proposed work is to investigate               the biochemical events that trigger the hypersensitive response                 of tobacco to Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.  Previous work                 has shown that initiation of hypersensitivity is marked by the                  activation of a plasma membrane potassium/proton exchange.                      Recent work by the applicants suggests that the exchange and                    hypersensitive responses are induced via a transmembrane signal                 transduction pathway that includes a calcium influx mechanism.                  They have also identified a GTPase that is associated with plasma               membranes isolated during the hypersensitive response.  The                     specific objectives of this research are to purify and                          characterize the plasma membrane GTPase and to determine whether                it functions as a G-protein in the proposed signaling pathway.                  The possibility that phospholipase activation is required for                   induction of the hypersensitive response and, if so, how this                   relates to calcium influx and the plasma membrane GTPase will                   also be investigated.  The experimental system is well developed                and includes plasma membranes isolated by two-phase aqueous                     partitioning, a tobacco suspension-culture system, and Tn5-                     induced bacterial mutants that do not induce the potassium/proton               exchange or hypersensitive responses.                                                                                                                           The results of this research will enhance our understanding of                  the biochemical signaling events that follow a plant's                          recognition of a microbial pathogen that subsequently gives rise                to the plant hypersensitive response.  This knowledge may                       facilitate the development of new mechanisms to promote disease                 resistance in crop plants.  This work will also contribute to our               fundamental understanding of signal transduction and plasma                     membrane biochemistry in plants.",
