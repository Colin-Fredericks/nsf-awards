 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metalanguages that are suitable for implementing derivation systems             such as proof systems and program transformation systems will be                investigated.  A crucial feature of such languages appears to be the            ability to represent higher.order objects and to manipulate them in             logically meaningful ways.  A higher.order logic programming language           that provides such a capability will be studied.  This language                 provides simply typed  \\-terms as data structures for representing              objects such as programs and proofs and incorporates higher-order               unification and search primitives for reasoning about such objects.             Experiments have shown that such a language has considerable potential          as a metalanguage, thus pointing to the importance of a robust and              efficient implementation for it.  This research will examine techniques         for efficiently implementing the novel operations in this language,             i.e. higher-order unification and the new search primitives, resulting          in the design of an abstract machine.  An implementation will be                provided based on these results and will be used to explore                     applications of this language within actual derivation systems.                 Feedback from these studies will be used to improve the behavior of the         implementation on commonly occurring problems.  Extensions to the               language based on using a richer class of  \\-terms will also be                 addressed.",
