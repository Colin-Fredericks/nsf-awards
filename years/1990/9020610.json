The workshop will be coordinated jointly by Argonne National             Laboratory and by the Japanese Institute for New Generation Computer            Technology (ICOT).  This workshop is a follow-up to the one held in             October, 1989 at Argonne National Laboratory.  The purpose of the               meeting is to provide an informal basis for exchange of ideas between           U.S. and Japanese researchers on topics relating to logic programming,          parallelism, and knowledge systems.  It will also provide a medium for          demonstration of key system and language principles.  Approximately 15          presentations will be given, as well as a number of demonstrations, by          participants of both countries.  Discussion sessions will provide time          to collect comments and ideas on future direction of the fields                 represented.  Overall, the on-going cooperative spirit between the two          countries will be enhanced by this opportunity to convene.",
