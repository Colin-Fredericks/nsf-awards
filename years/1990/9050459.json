 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has provided students with experience in classical and             modern techniques of infrared spectroscopy through frequent and                 varied use of a modern FT-IR spectrophotometer.  The department                 purchased a Perking Elmer 1650 FT-IR with a disk drive, plotter,                diffuse reflectance and variable angle specular reflectance                     accessories and a Sadtler IR library.  Students in general chemistry            encounter the FT-IR in a demonstration setting.  The instrument                 receives frequent use in organic chemistry where the students are               introduced to instrument operation and spectral comparison.  Several            experiments require the capabilities of the FT-IR, rather than a                conventional, instrument.  Students in a polymer chemistry laboratory           course take advantage of the reflectance accessories.  Use in                   analytical chemistry emphasizes small sample size capability, diffuse           reflectance and Fourier Transform theory.  Physical chemistry uses              the FT-IR to obtain some of the spectra needed to interpret                     rotational-vibrational spectra of HCl.  Biochemistry uses the                   instrument as an aid in isolation and identification of small                   biomolecules.  Undergraduate research utilizes the instrument when              it is available and appropriate to the project.  This project allows            students significantly more experience with infrared spectroscopy               because analysis time is much less and the capabilities are much                greater.  Students gain experience in modern infrared spectroscopy              techniques such as diffuse and specular reflectance, micro analysis             and computer based libraries.  The use of a Fourier transform                   instrument enhances understanding of this powerful tool.                                                                                                        The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the            NSF funds.",
