 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is intended to deepen our understanding of a                  novel class artificially-structured, magnetic layered materials,                composed of both amorphous and crystalline components.  The main                thrusts of the work will be:  (a) relationships between                         fundamental microscopic interactions (anisotropy and exchange)                  and the magnetic properties and spin correlations, (b)                          relationships between electronic structure, optical, and magneto-               optical properties, and (c) studies of the design of magnetic                   materials with the desired properties.  The types of experiments                to be performed include x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy,                 dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, Mossbauer effect,                          ellipsometry, polar Kerr effect, and small angle neutron                        scattering (at NIST).  In addition to providing information on                  procedures for producing different types of bilayered and multi-                layered magnetic films the research should increase our                         understanding of:  (a) interfacial magnetism and perpendicular                  anisotropy, (b) fundamental relationships between electronic                    structure and principles of alloy design based on chemical                      considerations, and (c) prospects for new magnetic-optic data                   storage media based on these systems.",
