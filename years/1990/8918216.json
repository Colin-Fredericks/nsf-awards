 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-path Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR)                   is a very valuable technique for quantifying trace gas                          concentrations in the near-surface atmosphere.  Drs. Gosz,                      Dahm, and Risser performed path-averaged analyses for CO2, H20,                 CH4, CO, and N2O over optical path-lengths ranging as far as 1                  km and at temporal frequencies as small as 1.5 second                           intervals.  Their research to date has extensively tested the                   FTIR instrument under field conditions and experimented with                    various combinations of instrument setups to maximize detection                 sensitivity for different path-lengths and gases.  The                          instrument is capable of making repeated high resolution                        analyses of key trace gases in the atmosphere which are                         strongly influenced by terrestrial and aquatic nutrient and                     energy cycling processes.                                                            This continuation proposal emphasizes how Drs. Gosz, Dahm,                 and Risser will interface new developments in the field of                      micrometeorology with long-path FTIR to move ecology to a new                   level of technological sophistication that permits the                          examination of key processes and rates of gas fluxes at                         realistic spatial and temporal scales in the field.  The major                  objectives of this proposal are:                                                                                                                                     1. Test Scale Theory Relating to Ecosystem Processes.                                                                                                           2. Develop Path-Averaged Meteorological Flux Measurements                          to Quantify Long-Path Fluxes.                                                                                                                                3. Measure Ecosystem Function with Path-Averaged Gaseous                           Fluxes.                                                                                                                                                      This research effort involves interdisciplinary inter-                     actions with theoretical and experimental micrometeorologists                   (U.S. Army, NOAA, NCAR), and theoretical and experimental                       ecosystem scientists.  The range of scales that can be studied                  with the concurrent use of the FTIR and new micrometeorological                 instrumentation bridges the gap between traditional ecological                  techniques and emerging macroscale air-craft and satellite-                     based technologies.  A major goal of this proposal is to                        further develop links between ecological and meteorological                     measurements at appropriate scales for use in addressing issues                 of regional and global environmental change.                                         Drs. Gosz, Dahm, and Risser are productive and innovative                  scientists.  Their research program has introduced important                    new technology to ecosystem research.  The institutional                        support for this research is excellent.",
