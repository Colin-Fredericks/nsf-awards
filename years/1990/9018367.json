Five departments in the College that will           participate in this program are aerospace; chemical, nuclear and                materials; civil; electrical; and mechanical engineering.   The Dean of         Engineering has appointed a Project Director to head this effort.  The          program will be administered by a committee made up of faculty members          and administrators.  The College, through the Graduate School, will             provide matching funds for seven fellowships; and the Dean of                   Engineering has made commitments to continue the effort after NSF               support ends by setting aside fifteen graduate assistantships or                fellowships.",
