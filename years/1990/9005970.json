 "awd_abstract_narration": "On 17 October 1989 the buildings of Moss Landing                    Marine Laboratories were destroyed by the magnitude 7.1 Loma                    Prieta earthquake.  Evidence at the time pointed to                             liquefaction of the sand under the facility as the cause.                       After a cruise on which side-scan sonar images and Uniboom                      seismic records were obatined adjacent the site of the labs it                  was realized that large scale slumping of the seafloor played a                 major role in the destruction.                                                             That slumping is evidenced by a series of slump                      scars and liquefaction sediment lobes that indicate movement of                 a large region in the direction of the nearby head of Monterey                  Canyon.  This project will study the evidence of the submarine                  slumps and associated liquefaction sediment lobes before the                    evidence is obscured by winter storms.  A shipboard program                     will collect repetitive side-scan surveys of the shallow areas                  of slumping, extend the previous side-scan survey to include                    the walls of the canyon, and sample the sediment lobes and                      slumps.  Direct observations will be made in shallow water by                   divers primarily for the purpose of establishing the effects on                 benthic ecology and for comparisions with seasonal cycles.",
