 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Nanofabircation Facility (NNF) at Cornell University has,          in its first twelve years, provided an outstanding research                     environment for thousands of graduate students and visiting scientists          from universities, government laboratories and industry throughout the          country.  Through this REU Site Project, the faculty, the director and          the full-time staff of the NNF, will give undergraduate students an             introduction to this field of science and engineering and an                    opportunity to experience this research environment.  The selection             process will bring bright young undergraduate students, including               minorities, to the Cornell campus for nine weeks to participate in a            variety of research projects related to microfabrication.  They will            meet and work with graduate students and faculty members, attend a              short course on the practical aspects of microfabrication, and observe          firsthand the interaction of the several disciplines that must come             together for the successful completion of research in this field.               This is intended to stimulate student interest in nanofabrication and           contribute to the availability of trained professionals in this high            technology area of science.",
