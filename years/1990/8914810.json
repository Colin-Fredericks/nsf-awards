 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of seven U.S. researchers             in a joint U.S.-Japan seminar on \"Advanced Materials for Severe                 Service Applications,\" to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 2-              7, 1990.  The principal topic areas for discussion are (a) composite            materials, (b) fracture toughness, (c) alloys for cryogenic and high            temperature application, and (d) materials behavior.  The principal             co-organizers of the seminar are Professor Arthur J. McEvily,                   Department of Metallurgy, University of Connecticut; and Professor              Hiroyuki Okamura, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The                     University of Tokyo, Japan.  A previous seminar on this general                 topic was held in 1986, also under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan               Cooperative Science Program.  At that time recommendations were                 made for further research on materials in areas considered critical             for future technology.  At this present seminar progress in this                research will be reviewed, and areas will again be identified where             further research and development are needed in order to improve                 design capabilities in terms of performance and reliability.                    Participants and observers will represent various academic,                     industrial, and governmental research organizations in the two                  countries.                                                                                                                                                      Advances in structural design are dependent on the availability of              materials capable of withstanding the demands imposed upon them.                These demands include the nature of the imposed stresses as well as             the environment in which the materials are used.  As operating                  temperatures increase, the use of non-traditional structural                    materials, such as ceramics and composites, may be needed.  Other               approaches may involve the use of protective coatings to serve as               thermal barriers or to guard against oxidation or corrosion.  Some              structures must operate at cryogenic temperatures, and this places              other demands on the materials employed.  In all cases consideration            must be given to the behavior of cracks, including dynamic                      characteristics, detection, fatigue, and stress corrosion cracking.             The seminar is expected to promote not only international                       communication regarding current research on these topics, but also              communication between specialists in the mechanics community and in             the materials community in areas of common interest.  The                       participants will benefit from sharing new results, evaluating the              progress of current projects, and charting possible future directions           for individual and cooperative research.  Publication of the                    proceedings of the seminar is planned.",
