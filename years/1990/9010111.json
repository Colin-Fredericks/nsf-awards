 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop novel techniques for the                analysis of filtered discrete self-similar signals and investigate their        application in speech modeling and recognition, image texture                   segmentation and object recognition based on contour information.               Specifically, filtered discrete self-similar signals are used as tools          for modeling both the long term and short term characteristics of               signals of interest and novel multiscale algorithms for estimating their        parameters are constructed.  A multiscale solution to the problem of            finding an iterated function system whose attractor best approximates           a given M-D curve in the Hausdorff measure is also being developed.             Particular attention will be given to parallel implementation of the            algorithms.                                                                                                                                                     Filtered discrete self-similar signals are also studied as models for           speech signals with particular emphasis on the naturalness of the               produced speech.  Furthermore, their parameters and the parameters of           iterated function systems approximations to speech demisyllables are            tested for use as feature vectors in speech recognition systems.  M-D           experiments are also being performed to investigate the usefulness of           M-D filtered discrete self-similar signals and iterated function systems        in texture segmentation and object recognition tasks.",
