 "awd_abstract_narration": "The defoliation of montane cloud forest in Puerto Rico by a                recent hurricane offers an opportunity to investigate the                       influence of canopy structure on the deposition of material from                the atmosphere and the chemical processing of that material                     before it reaches the forest floor.  Drs. Lovett and Asbury                     hypothesize that: 1. As the canopy recovers, cloud water                        deposition will first increase in response to increasing surfaces               for deposition, and then decrease as the canopy becomes dense                   enough to limit penetration of wind and cloud droplets.  2. The                 canopy will take up NO3-, NH4+, and H+ and release all other                    ions.  The amount of uptake or release will increase rapidly in                 the initial stages of recovery and then level off at higher                     levels of canopy surface areas.  3. Because of the abundance of                 chemically active epiphytes on boles and branches, stemflow                     chemistry will change more than throughfall chemistry as the                    canopy recovers.                                                                     This innovative research takes advantage of a natural                      catastrophe to investigate the properties of forest canopy-                     atmosphere interaction.  This is an important area of research                  for global change and atmospheric deposition.  Drs. Lovett and                  Asbury are highly qualified investigators who have experience                   with sampling and modeling canopy-atmosphere interactions.",
