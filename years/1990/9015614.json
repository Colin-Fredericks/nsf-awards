 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of organic bromine chemistry in the lower               arctic atmosphere, particularly in relation to tropospheric                     destruction of ozone.  It has been observed that shortly after the              arctic sunrise, surface ozone concentrations decline from a late                winter maximum to near zero before recovering to moderately high                summer values.  There is also strong evidence which implies that                the primary cause for the minimum is the photolytic production of               bromine radicals from organic bromine gases, which then combine                 with ozone.  The chemical pathways are conjectural and little is                known about the origins of the organic bromine, but it is believed              that a marine source is the most probable.  This study addresses                the former question through a field program at Resolute, N.W.T.,                Canada, to collect and analyze atmospheric particulate bromine and              both inorganic and organic gaseous bromine, as well as other                    halogens (chlorine and iodine) to assess their possible                         contributions to tropospheric chemistry during the arctic spring.               Supporting ozone and meteorological variables are measured                      routinely at the Barrow Observatory of the Geophysical Monitoring               for Climatic Change Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric             Administration.  The complementary effort to collect and analyze                headspace gases from incubated arctic macrophyte, phytoplankton,                ice algae, and other samples is included in a separately funded                 action.",
