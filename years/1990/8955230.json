 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operation Chemistry will be a national elementary and middle                    school (grades 4-8) teacher training project directed by the                    American Chemical Society, modelled after Operation Physics of                  the American Institute of Physics.  The latter project                          developed materials and worked with teams of teachers,                          university professors and science supervisors to improve the                    teaching of physics (physical science) at these grade levels.                                                                                                   This first phase of Operation Chemistry will develop the                        teaching materials for the chemistry component of middle grade                  physical science to be used in the later phases of teacher                      training.  The materials will be developed by teams of                          experienced teachers and professors at the school and                           university levels.  Dr. Paul Kelter of the University of                        Wisconsin at Oshkosh in conjunction with Dr. Ann Benbow of the                  American Chemical Society (manager of the Pre High School                       Program) will direct the preparation of twelve modular teacher                  workshop books.  The chemistry content of the physical science                  which is taught in these grade levels has not, as yet, been                     well-defined in the available texts or literature.  A very                      knowledgable group of chemists and teachers have been selected                  to accomplish this task.                                                                                                                                        These materials will be field-tested in schools at the above-                   mentioned grades to determine their appropriateness in terms of                 level and implementability. They will be hands-on experiential                  activities based on the philosophy of inquiry and discovery.                    These materials will subsequently be used in the second phase                   of the project to \"train\" teams of teachers, administrators,                    science supervisors and industrial chemists to disseminate the                  materials and lead workshops for other teachers.  This projects                 funds the first phase of the project, the development and                       field-testing of the materials.                                                                                                                                 About 49% of the NSF request for funds has been cost-shared by                  the American Chemical Society and the University of Wisconsin                   at Oshkosh.",
