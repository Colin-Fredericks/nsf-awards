 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences                  proposes to initiate a new field course on Margarita Island,                    Venezuela for the benefit of undergraduates in all three of our                 disciplines, including students form other campuses nationally.                 This course would address the physical environment, unlike the                  many biologically-oriented field courses which are offered at                   tropical research stations.  Logistical support would come from a               marine institute, Fundacion La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, which               has 300 employees on Magarita Island.  This institute collects                  data in all three disciplines and presently supports five of our                graduate students.  Most of the field equipment needed for the                  proposed course already is available.  The remaining equipment                  would be provided under the terms of this proposal, e.g. grab                   samplers and peat corers, an S4 meter for marine currents, and                  several meteorological instruments.  Much of this course would be               devoted to interrelationships among marine, tectonic, and                       atmospheric processes.  To our knowledge, this inter-disciplinary               approach would be unique among tropical field courses.",
