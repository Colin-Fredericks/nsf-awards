 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies a new control design methodology for                      uncertain dynamic systems, where the uncertainty is                             associated with the system's nonlinearity or time varying                       characteristics.  The intent is to develop a controller                         which does not depend on any knowledge of the uncertainty                       except its possible bound.  The control problem is                              formulated in a geometric manner where the uncertainty is                       described to lie within a hyperpolyhedron domain.  And                          since uncertainty on system performance occurs at the                           corner points of the hyperpolyhedron, it is sufficient to                       study the system behavior by examining the polyhedron                           corner points.  Computer dynamic programming techniques are                     used in searching for the solution.  The research comprises                     two components, a practical design problem, and an                              analytical design problem.  The analytical task examines                        the feasibility of using artificial neural networks to                          design and implement the control concept.  The practical                        design task will demonstrate the practicality of the method                     for a flexible beam structure with piezoelectric sensors                        and actuators.",
