 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Joseph Noel has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Noel's doctoral degree was from                   Ohio State University under the direction of Professor Ming-Daw                 Tsai.  Dr. Noel intends to continue research at Yale University                 under the sponsorship of Professor Paul Sigler.  Dr. Noel's                     area of postdoctoral research will be the elucidation of the                    structural basis for enzymic catalytic mechanisms as revealed                   largely by x-ray crystallography. He will be crystallizing the                  membrane photoreceptor protein, rhodopsin.  The experience                      gained from this study should facilitate longer-range studies                   of the structure, chemistry and evolution of chorismate mutase.                                                                                                 The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
