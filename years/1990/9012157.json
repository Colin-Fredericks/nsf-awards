 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bound thiols are probably significant microbial substrates,                since over 95% of the 3-MPA and methanethiol fractions recovered                from the sediments are bound by disulfide linkages to sediment                  particles.  In previous research, 3-Mercaptopropionate (3-MPA)                  was detected as major thiol in the anoxic, coastal, marine                      sediments; present at lower concentrations were mercaptopyruvate,               mercaptoethanol and mercaptoacetate.  3-MPA occurred as its                     oxidized, dithio-form, in oxic regions of the sediments.                        Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte in marine plants,                was transformed in sediment slurries to 3-MPA by sequential                     demethylation with 3-methiolpropionate as an intermediate.                      Homocysteine and methionine were also converted to 3-MPA.  These                transformations need establishing by the isolation of the micro-                organisms that are involved.  Bacteria that demethylate DMSP or                 3-methiolpropionate will be isolated, as will those which                       dissimilate and assimilate 3-MPA or its methylated precursors.                  Sulfate-reducers that incompletely oxidize organic compounds will               be tested for conversions of sulfur-containing amino acids to 3-                MPA, mercaptopyruvate, mercaptoethanol and mercaptoacetate.  The                ability of sulfate-reducers to oxidize mercaptopyruvate,                        mercaptoacetate and mercaptoethanol will also be studied.  The                  research will reveal biochemical conversions of organic thiols                  that are characteristic of, and perhaps unique to, marine                       sediments.",
